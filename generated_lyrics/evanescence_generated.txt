Brushed off the face in your world behind
And love is more than to be so blind
Say you will still remember the world
All the things I have burned paradise
Wont you take me to let go of me
Every beat of my love youll see
Lithium dont want to live to breathe
Can this be what I really need
Can you feel like a stubborn child
Get me out of love without a soul
I see what I know you cant control
they run through my skin the way I came
break me dont you see into my core
So long so long I dont mind
Im coming for you to live the lie
And if I was looking to score
Shes gonna get you back now love
Ive got a new way to believe
And I will see you my love youll see
Cant wish it all sick of the evil
Breathe in and take me to life
Thats the way I feel good enough
When the darkness feel so good to feel
All that Im like a stubborn child
Youre the one to take its toll
So much more I can see the truth
Dont try to fight the good fight
Stay with you to live let live
I dont understand how to breathe
You dont know if I was strong
Stuck here I need to tell anyone
Im too weak to survive in the town
Well be lost in your pain
I want to give me to die
So I wont let me in the storm
And all I know you love me
But big enough to let you win
Save me from your deadly poison
If you want to heal my soul
Ive tried so hard for me not now
Ive got to tell you my love
All the way I feel it in
So I cant live your life
And in the end of the lie
So go on and on to me
They dont understand what it seems
So I wont let me die here
I reach but I know you dont want to
I know what I know I will see you
So I wont lie to me if you do
You know youre not at the seams
Should I let the moment she doesnt
If I try to take you away
And youre too late to change the way
Not what you what you what you say
To believe that I cant go back to
Gonna take you away from you
Im so sick of it all away
Now I cant fight it all away
All the way I feel for you
