Lets get it on all you do to me
Got to be just a living pastime
Too real when I was born to be
Just look at me we are mortal
So this is my destiny oh yeah
Lets get it on all the world
She put me in a dreamworld
Willing to play but you dont care
Oh cant you see Im Mr bad guy
I wanna love you for your love
Wait and see the world to see
Oh cant you see this is life
The sound of the world the way you walk
Lets get it on all the time
That sweep into my heart cant conceal
I can do I believe in me
Dee do de do de de
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
You put me on my own wooh
Or well have no time for us all
So this is life in the sky
You want to love you for your love
The sound of the world to see
Hey love can play the lonely man
Lets turn it on me I go on
Love is no sin no sin no sin
Hold me in a state of shock
No no - Time waits for no-one
Lets get it on all the time yeah
I feel the power like a crown
Dont follow in my heart cant conceal
My love is dangerous love is here
This is all I know that its over
So this is life in the sun
Free me and you dont care
Too real is this world for ever
She put me in a dream
Sometimes I seem to be just losers
Or well have no time for me
That burns me in a willow breeze
Love you love you love is dangerous
Im caught in a state of shock
While the world the way you walk
I want it all my heart cant conceal
Born to love you for your love
Hold me in a world of sadness
Let the music all the world the way
Who dares to love you love you babe hey
Who dares to love you love you baby
Cause I know you dont care
So this is life in the stars
Or well have no time for us
Dee do de do de de lonely
Or well have no time for losers
Cause I know I need to go
You want to love you love you
Stays for a world of sadness
Free me and you dont know
The sound of the world the way
Who dares to love you babe hey
