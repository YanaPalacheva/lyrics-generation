I remember all the words you said
To the heart is a long way to be
But only where you are in your name
Ill wait the time to look inside
This way could be close beside me
May it be I am only dreaming
But only where you are from home
It rises up to the stars sign
Ill find a way to be found
I look up to touch the ground
The Valley where the road you chose
Morning has come to find his love
And where the winds are still enough
Come back to the waves the sea
Strange how I still keep on calling
I took the turn I have known
Ill find a way to be mine
Come back to the river flows
It may be the night it giveth
They wait the time to look inside
This light that I believe the sky
Out of the sky fall down on me
The ebb and the heart is a pilgrim
Those men from the night is overcome
Waiting here as I have just taken
The Tree of the darkness of the moon
Hope has a place of the earth
Green grew and the light will be
Carry me on the road takes him
and there I find that I must follow
If only I could be the sky
Come dream and then I find another
the beauty of the sky in silver
Where the road are you this moment ends
For me for me to my mothers arms
The diamonds on the waves speak up
Let the rain the rain fall down
This is the way back to me
And now you know love is over
And now you know time will not be kept
Green is in the morning wakens you
For me for me to my lazy day
And all the waves to the wise
Why do you know I must follow
And my name in the lovers heart
White is in the sky with stars
Each heart is oh so far away
When you could find my day maybe
Will you find a way to go
One way to make the sky
Come back to my heart in two
I go there youre gone from view
enough for me to my lazy day
Green is in the sky with stars
Telling all that I was with you
If I could find my day maybe
But you dont know where you go
Now I walk to the stars two
Enough for me to my lazy day
This way could be where you go
