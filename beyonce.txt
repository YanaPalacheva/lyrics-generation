Oh baby, how you doing?
You know I'm gonna cut right to the chase
Some women were made but me, myself
I like to think that I was created for a special purpose
You know, what's more special than you? You feel me
It's on baby, let's get lost
You don't need to call into work 'cause you're the boss
For real, want you to show me how you feel
I consider myself lucky, that's a big deal
Why? Well, you got the key to my heart
But you ain't gonna need it, I'd rather you open up my body
And show me secrets, you didn't know was inside
No need for me to lie
It's too big, it's too wide
It's too strong, it won't fit
It's too much, it's too tough
He talk like this 'cause he can back it up
He got a big ego, such a huge ego
I love his big ego, it's too much
He walk like this 'cause he can back it up
Usually I'm humble, right now I don't choose
You can leave with me or you could have the blues
Some call it arrogant, I call it confident
You decide when you find on what I'm working with
Damn I know I'm killing you with them legs
Better yet them thighs
Matter a fact it's my smile or maybe my eyes
Boy you a site to see, kind of something like me
It's too big, it's too wide
It's too strong, it won't fit
It's too much, it's too tough
I talk like this 'cause I can back it up
I got a big ego, such a huge ego
But he love my big ego, it's too much
I walk like this 'cause I can back it up
I, I walk like this 'cause I can back it up
I, I talk like this 'cause I can back it up
I, I can back it up, I can back it up
I walk like this 'cause I can back it up
It's too big, it's too wide
It's too strong, it won't fit
It's too much, it's too tough
He talk like this 'cause he can back it up
He got a big ego, such a huge ego, such a huge ego
I love his big ego, it's too much
He walk like this 'cause he can back it up
Ego so big, you must admit
I got every reason to feel like I'm that bitch
Ego so strong, if you ain't know
I don't need no beat, I can sing it with pianoplayin' everything so easy,
it's like you seem so sure.
still your ways, you dont see
i'm not sure if they're for me.
then things come right along our way, though we didn't truly ask.
it seems as if they're gonna linger
with every delight they bring,
just like what you have truly seemed.
i'm trying to think of what you really want to say,
even through my darkest day.
you might want to leave me,
feeling strange about you
like you're gonna let me know,
when words then slipped out of you.
when words dont come so easy to say
you just leave me feeling, come what may
though i want things coming from your way.
i say to you, you bore me all the time
when you seem to hold back all in you,
all that you want to let me know.
why dont you have the courage?
speak up and i'll listen,
if you truly want me to know, then tell me.
is there something wrong with you
and you seem fastened there.
it sounds as if there'll be a melody
if things in you are let out
and then i will feel alright.
when you sleep, do you feel the same,
exactly as i do?
i really want to hear things from you,
though i've felt something new
eversince you acted that way.
if i go,
would you still mind telling me?
if i stay,
you seem to let the days go by.
if you truly want to let me know,
then tell me.If you search
For tenderness
It isn't hard to find
You can have the love
You need to live
But if you look
For truthfulness
You might just
As well be blind
It always seems to be
So hard to give
Chorus:
Honesty
Is such a lonely word
Everyone is so untrue
Honesty
Is hardly ever heard
And mostly
What I need from you
I can always
Find someone
To say
They sympathize
If I wear my heart
Out on my sleeve
But I don't want
Some pretty face
To tell me
Pretty lies
All I want
Is someone
To believe
(Chorus)
I can find a lover
I can find a friend
I can have security
Until the bitter end
Anyone can comfort me
With promises again
I know, I know
When I'm deep
Inside of me
Don't be
Too concerned
I won't ask
For nothin'
While I'm gone
But when I want
Sincerity
Tell me where else
Can I turn
When
You're the one
That I depend upon
(Chorus)Oh oh oh I, oh oh oh I
[Verse 1:]
If I wrote a book about where we stand
Then the title of my book would be "Life with Superman"
That's how you make me feel I count you as a privilege
This love is so ideal
I'm honored to be in it
I know you feel the same I see it everyday
In all the things you do
In all the things you say
[Chorus:]
You are my rock
Baby you're the truth
You are my rock
I love to rock with you
You are my rock
You're everything I need
You are my rock
So baby rock with me
I wanna kiss ya, feel ya, please ya just right
I wanna touch ya, love ya, baby all night
Reward ya, for all the things you do
You are my rock
I love to rock with you
I love to rock with you
Oh oh oh I
[Verse 2:]
If I were to try to count the ways
You make me smile
I'd run out of fingers
Before I run out of timeless things to talk about
Sugar you keeps it going on
Make me wanna keep my lovin strong
Make me wanna try my best
To give you what you want and what you need
Give you my whole heart, not just a little piece
More than a minimum,
I'm talking everything
More than a single wish,
I'm talking every dream
[Chorus:]
You are my rock
Baby you're the truth
You are my rock
I love to rock with you
You are my rock
You're everything I need
You are my rock
So baby rock with me
I wanna kiss ya, feel ya, please ya just right
I wanna touch ya, love ya, baby all night
Reward ya, for all the things you do
You are my rock
I love to rock with you
I wanna rock with you
[Bridge:]
If there's options I don't want them
They're not worth my time
Cause if it's not you, oh no thank you I like us just fine
You're a rock in the sand
You're a smile in a cry
You're my joy through the pain
You're the truth through the lies
No matter what I do I know that I can count on you
Oh oh oh I, oh oh oh I
[Chorus:]
You are my rock
Baby you're the truth
You are my rock
I love to rock with you
You are my rock
You're everything I need
You are my rock
So baby rock with me
I wanna kiss ya, feel ya, please ya just right
I wanna touch ya, love ya, baby all night
Reward ya, for all the things you do
You are my rock
I love to rock with you
I love to rock with you
Oh oh oh I, oh oh oh I
I wanna kiss ya, feel ya, please ya just right
I wanna touch ya, love ya, baby all night
Reward ya, for all the things you do
You are my rock
I love to rock with you

Church bells ringing
I heard
A choir singing
I saw my love
Walk down
The aisle
On her finger
He placed a ring
Oooh, oh
I saw them
Holding hands
She was
Standing there
Wwith my man
I heard
Them promise
Til death do
Us part
Each word
Was a pain
In my heart
All I could do
All I could do
Was cry
All I could do
Was cry
I was
Losing the man
That I love
And all
I could do
Was cry
And now
The wedding
Is over
The rice, rice
Has been
Thrown over
Their heads
For them life
Has just begun
But mine
Is ending
Ooh
All I could do
All I could do
Was cry
All I could do
Was cry
I was losing
The man
That I love
And all
I could do
Was cryThis is just another day that I would spend
Waitin' for the right one.
Staring at the night and wishin' I could be the one
To feel the warm sun.
You're a dream, but I'm wide awake
I'm in Heaven, for heaven sakes
So get ready, (get ready) I'm ready now (get ready)
I could never need you more than now
You were worth waiting for
You the one that I adore
Hold on to me tight
For once in my life
You were worth waiting for
You the one that I adore
This kind of love you'll only find
Once in a lifetime, once in a lifetime
Tell me that your living in a place
Where no one else can find you.
Tell me that your sanging out my name,
Hoping that I'll hear you.
Tell me "No" and I'll fade away,
But this is lovin that I won't waste
So get ready, (get ready) I'm ready now (get ready)
I could never need you more than now
You were worth waiting for
You the one that I adore
hold on to me tight
For once in my life
You were worth waiting for
You the one that I adore
This kind of love you'll only find
Once in a lifetime, once in a lifetime
What are the words, I'm needin' to hear
How do I know if I'll ever love again
Seeing your face makes everything clear (clear) clear
And I will never be the same
You were worth waiting for
You the one that I adore

For once in my life
You were worth waiting for
You the one that I adore
This kind of love you'll only find

It's 6 o'clock
and seconds feel like hours as I sit here
and watch them tick away
And just the thought
of seeing you again I wanna sing
I've been longing for this day
I'll be waiting
'cause I cant smile untill I see your smile
I'll be waiting

pressed against mine again
I'm waiting!

I'll be waiting
'cause I can't sleep until I hear your heart

'cause patiently I'll wait right here for you
I don't care how long it takes
I don't mind I'm alright I'll sit and wait
'til the sun comes down and rise
and come right back up again

When your aps in the bar is in my life

I read all of the magazines
while waiting around
you said you couldn't wait to see me
but you got stuck in town
so turn off the phone
now we're finally alone
and some moments at the end of the day
feel your touch and it's the sweetest
your kisses are my weakness
i never want them to go away
Chorus:
i wanna feel you in my heart (heart)
as i look into your eyes (eyes)
no need to get busy so lets take our time
and make slow love slow love
and every minute that we have (have)
it goes too fast
wanna show you how to rock it
so this feelin last and
make slow love slow love
slow love slow love slow love all night
Verse 2:
it is just a few little things
that you gotta know
a girl will give you all of her heart
when it's happening slow
i need a little laughter
and love will follow after
lets take this chance to steal away
your kisses are delicious
and no one is gonna miss us
tonight i really want you to stay
Chorus:
i wanna feel you in my heart (heart)
as i look into your eyes (eyes)
no need to get busy so lets take our time
and make slow love slow love
and every minute that we have (have)
it goes too fast
wanna show you how to rock it
so this feelin last and
make slow love slow love
slow love slow love slow love all night
Bridge:
so I'm callin out do you hear my cries?
don't have to say goodbye
your the breath on my skin cherish the taste
it's far too good to go to waste
feel my desire
make sweet love all through
all through the night
make love through the night
Chorus:
i wanna feel you in my heart (heart)
as i look into your eyes (eyes)
no need to get busy so lets take our time
and make slow love slow love
and every minute that we have (have)

slow love slow love slow love all nightN-n-now, honey
You better sit down and look around
'Cause you must've bumped yo' head
And I love you enough to talk some sense back into you, baby
I'd hate to see you come home
Me, the kids, and the dog is gone
Check my credentials
I give you everything you want, everything you need
Even your friends say I'm a good woman
All I need to know is why?
Why don't you love me?
Tell me, baby, why don't you love me
When I make me so damn easy to love?
And why don't you need me?
Tell me, baby, why don't you need me
When I make me so damn easy to need?
I got beauty, I got class
I got style and I got ass
And you don't even care to care, looka here
I even put money in the bank account
Don't have to ask no one to help me out
You don't even notice that
Why don't you love me?
Tell me, baby, why don't you love me
When I make me so damn easy to love?
Why don't you need me?
Tell me, baby, why don't you need me
When I make me so damn easy to need?
I got beauty, I got heart
Keep my head in them books, I'm sharp
But you don't care to know I'm smart
N-n-n-n-n-no
I got moves in your bedroom
Keep you happy with the nasty things I do
But you don't seem to be in tune, ooh
Why don't you love me?
Tell me, baby, why don't you love me
When I make me so damn easy to love?
Why don't you need me?
Tell me, baby, why don't you need me
When I make me so damn easy to need?
There's nothing not to love about me
No, no, there's nothing not to love about me
I'm lovely, there's nothing not to need about me
No, no, there's nothing not to need about me
Maybe you're just not the one
Or maybe you're just plain dumbI lay alone awake at night
Sorrow fills my eyes
But I'm not strong enough to cry
Despite of my disguise
I'm left with no shoulder
But everybody wants to lean on me
I guess I'm their soldier
Well, who's gonna be mine?
Who's there to save the hero
When she's left all alone?
And she's crying out for help
Who's there to save the hero?
Who's there to save the girl
After she saves the world?
After she saves the world
I bottle all my hurt inside
I guess I'm living a lie
Inside my mind each day I die
What can bring me back to life?
A simple word, a gesture
Someone to say you're beautiful
Come find this buried treasure
With eyes lead to a pot of gold
Who's there to save the hero
When she's left all alone?
And she's crying out for help
Who's there to save the hero?
Who's there to save the girl
After she saves the world?
After she saves the world
I've given too much of myself
And now it's driving me crazy
(I'm crying out for help)
Sometimes I wish someone would just come here
And save me, save me from myself
Who's there to save the hero
When she's left all alone?
And she's crying out for help
Who's there to save the hero?
Who's there to save the girl
After she saves the world?
After she saves the worldHello hello baby you called

Love is so hard to find
You led me on to believe, you belong to me
oohh ooohh
I'm going trough difficult times
I always thought you were mine
Love doesn't feel like this, this is my final wish
The next time your truck rolls by
No matter how hard I cry
Please don't stop in front of me
Cause your loves no longer sweet
The next time I bring you change
Baby please pull back ya hand
You know your not what I need
Let me go, let me do B
(2x) You've got me chasing after you like a ice cream truck, I try my luck and catch up, but it's always out of luck
Faster and faster I ran
You sped up and then
Just as I thought I've caught up
I'm chasing you again
Finally,
You stopped and I jumped on
I realized your flavor was wrong
You thought I was still holding on
It's good to know your gone
The next time your truck rolls by
No matter how hard I cry
Please don't stop in front of me
Cause your love's no longer sweet
The next time I bring you change
Baby please pull back ya hand
You know your not what I need
Let me go, Let me do B
(2x) You've got me chasing after you like a ice cream truck, I try my luck and catch up, but it's always out of luck.Youre everything I thought you never were
And nothing like I thought you couldve been
But still you live inside of me
So tell me how is that?
Youre the only one I wish I could forget
The only one Id love to not forgive
And though you break my heart, youre the only one
And though there are times when I hate you
Cause I cant erase
The times that you hurt me
And put tears on my face
And even now while I hate you
It pains me to say
I know Ill be there at the end of the day
I dont wanna be without you babe
I dont want a broken heart
Dont wanna take a breath with out you babe
I dont wanna play that part
I know that I love you
But let me just say
I dont want to love you in no kind of way no no
I dont want a broken heart
And I dont wanna play the broken-hearted girlNo...No
No broken-hearted girl
Im no broken-hearted girl
Something that I feel I need to say
But up to now Ive always been afraid
That you would never come around
And still I want to put this out
You say youve got the most respect for me
But sometimes I feel youre not deserving me
And still youre in my heart
But youre the only one and yes
There are times when I hate you
But I dont complain
Cause Ive been afraid that you would've walk away
Oh but now I dont hate you
Im happy to say
That I will be there at the end of the day
I dont wanna be without you babe
I dont want a broken heart
Dont wanna take breath with out you babe
I dont wanna play that part
I know that I love you
But let me just say
I dont want to love you in no kind of way no no
I dont want a broken heart
And I dont wanna play the broken-hearted girl...NoNo
No broken-hearted girl
Now Im at a place I thought Id never beOooo

Ain't gotta be afraid my broken heart is free
To spread my wings and fly away
Away With you
yeah yeah yeah, ohh ohh ohh
I dont wanna be without my baby
I dont wanna a broken heart
Dont want to take a breath with out my baby
I dont wanna play that part
I know that I love you
But let me just say
I dont want to love you in no kind of way..No..No
I dont want a broken heart
I dont wanna play the broken-hearted girl..No..No..
No broken-hearted girl
Broken-hearted girl Nono
No broken-hearted girl
No broken-hearted girlI gotta give up
to quite the storm that rages inside
the way that I hit my damage part
you gave me away
And I've had enough
I imagine the words I say to you
I'm finding strange to follow it trough
I'm ready to change
I'm letting go, I'm letting go
We're only friends, We're only friends
Tonight we'll let the music free our souls
So let it show, so let it show
We can pretend, we can pretend
We only find ourselves by loosing all
Control (x8)
I'm opening it up
show me a sign I can't relieve
It's crazy emotions flow trough me
I'm gonna explode
You take me away
and what is my ordinary life
I wont be afraid of what we might find a love I can hold
I'm letting go, I'm letting go
We're only friends, We're only friends
Tonight we'll let the music free our souls
So let it show, So let it show
We can pretend, we can pretend
We only find ourselves by loosing all
Control
Nothing injured nothing gained
New horizon ready to play
with every breath you take it away
I'm letting go, I'm letting go
We're only friends, We're only friends
Tonight we'll let the music free our souls
So let it show, So let it show
We can pretend, we can pretend
We only find ourselves by loosing all
Control (x8)It really hurts to say this yes it does
But after a while sweet love just ain't enough
So many settle for less just because
Maybe I'm more in love with what it was
But what's gets so confusing baby
You and me
It's been so much confusion lately
You couldn't see that you were losing me
Well I'm alone now but I ain't lonely
I'm on my own now
But I ain't the only
Honestly I'm fine
I'll take this time to concentrate on me
And I got possibility to keep me company
Won't you just assume he doesn't care
To internalize it all isn't fare
So I address the problem so that he's aware
But I still feel all alone even when he's there
Maybe we can fix it baby
I know we can
If I make you miss it baby
Then maybe you will understand
That I'm alone now but I ain't lonely
I'm on my own now
But I ain't the only
Honestly I'm fine
I'll take this time to concentrate on me
And I got possibility to keep me company
la la la la la la la la laaa
la la la la la la la la laaa
la la la la la la la la laaa
la la la la la la la la laaa
Well I'm alone now but I ain't lonely
I'm on my own now
But I ain't the only
Honestly I'm fine
I'll take this time to concentrate on me
And I got possibility to keep me companyYou're bad for me I clearly get it
I don't see how something good could come from loving you
The death of me must be your mission
Cause with every hug and kiss you're snatching every bit of strength
That I'm gon need to fight off the inevitable
And it's a heart breaking situation I'm up in, but I can't control
[Chorus]
You're just like poison
Slowly moving through my system
Breaking all of my defenses with time
You're just like poison and I just don't get it
How can something so deadly feel so right?
I'm not sure of what to do it's a catch 22
cause the cure is found in you I don't want it but I do
You're just like poison
My affliction, I'm addicted, I can't lie
Kiss me one more time before I die
[Verse 2]
You aint right take me high
Then that high it subsides
And my body flat lines
Then you come to revive
Wait wait wait I'm alive
But how long will it last
Will it all come crashing down?
How many doses am I needing now?
What's the prognosis will you be around?
Or am I just another victim of an assassin that broke my heart down
[Chorus]
Baby you're just like poison
Slowly moving through my system
Breaking all of my defenses with time
You're just like poison
And I just don't get it
How can something so deadly
Feel so right
I'm not sure what to do
It's a catch 22
Cause the cure is found in you
I don't want it but I do
You're just like poison
My affliction, I'm addicted, I cant lie
Kiss me one more time before I die
[Bridge]
It's just not my body (No)
It's my mind, you don't know
How many times I told myself
This cant do (cant do)
And that I don't need you (No I don't need you)(no)
It's so unfair(fair) that I find myself right back in your care(care)
And what's good is that when you're not always there (there there)
You're no good for my health (my heath)
You're just like poison (whoa whoa whoa) (repeat)
[Chorus]
You're just like poison
Slowly moving through my system
Breaking all of my defenses with time
You're just like poison
And I just don't get it
How can something so deadly
Feel so right
I'm not sure of what to do
It's a catch 22
Cause the cure is found in you
I don't want it but I do
You're just like poison
My affliction, I'm addicted, I cant lie
Baby Kiss me one more time
you're just like poison
Slowly moving through my system
Breaking all of my defenses with time
You're just like poison
And I just don't get it
How can something so deadly
Feel so right
I'm not sure what to do
It's a catch 22
Cause the cure is found in you
I don't want it to
You're just like poison
I'm addicted, I cant lie
Kiss me one more time
Before I die

Beyonce
IAM
Welcome
Welcome
Hey
Ohhhh
Beyonc - Chorus:
Welcome to a place
Where people lie to your face
Just to get it done.
Welcome to the human race
Where if you ain't got money, then you'll pay in pain
Welcome to this world of ours
And if you had the chance would you come back again ?
Cause now you're here there ain't no turning back,
You got tears in your eyes
And the monkey on your back (?)*
Akhenaton - Verse 1:
Bienvenue l o l'fort tue le faible, o la faim tue de fait
O la socit t'congratule, et t'accepte une fois la fortune faite,
O les dettes cumulent, o l'crdit accule, des tas d'foyers,
O les hommes en perte d'idaux, jurent qu'par les putes dvoyes en vido,
Chaque soir c'est la fte, les salons cossus attirent les fesses,
Sur les gros cads, qui arrosent les guridons de pure cocane,
Ici, les gosses rvent d't'Pirs, beaucoup partent et peu qui restent,
Nombreux sont ceux qui ds 13 ans connaissent leur premire ivresse,
Bienvenue l o l'air pollu, par les pots d'chappement dclenchent
Allergies en cascade, et taux record d'O3 dans les bronches,
Douleurs dans les hanches, rien plus d'dangereux qu'la faune humaine
Quand ils explosent un fourgon Brinks sans peine au Tri-Nitro-Tolune,
Les vices connus gnent la machine de l'Etat, les cabinets changent
Laissent la merde en tat, peu passent les menottes en mtal, on en est l
Ici 300 blinds font c'qui veulent, font comme s'ils vivent seuls
Ramnent tout leur p'tite gueule, quand mille meurent fauchs dans l'viseur
Bienvenue, aprs le 11 septembre on voque une aut'voie
Au silence : dis au revoir, l'enculeur d'aut'fois, dit baiser le monde haute voix
O les vieux des pays riches fantasment sur les m'mes de Bangkok
Pourquoi donc mettre part ces connards en taule
Ici on croit moins en Dieu qu'aux fant'mes, un hymne sanguinaire
On entonne, partout on sent la peur d'un peuple pass au pantone
L'hiver mange l't, et l'printemps parfois tue l'automne,
Crie Plus fort, les grands de c'monde, ont gar quelque part leur sonotone
Bienvenue, mes p'tits anges
Car voici c'monde
Beyonc - Chorus:
Welcome to a place

We all have a purpose in this world
We have to believe that we belong
Can't forget where we came from
We came from love.
Shurik'n - Verse 2:
Bienvenue dans c'truc entre enfer et paradis tant't l'un tant't l'autre.
Ange et dmon s'y disputent le parvis pour enjeu ceux qui s'y vautrent.
O l'on s'occupe de l'horreur seulement quand elle frappe nos portes.
O la rumeur tue sournoisement, vicieux coup de surin dans l'aorte.
O tu bouffes de la merde chaque jour et on te le dit qu'20 ans aprs.
Parce qu'en fait ils s'en tapent de c' qu'on pense on l'sait mais ils le diront jamais.
O on est trop con pour voir qu'un mec est bon bien avant qu'il meure
Puis on se vante de le connatre achetant ses tableaux visitant sa demeure
Bienvenue dans c'monde o on se dit tous gaux blague part l
L'caniveau l haut c'est les bureaux mais le mieux c'est au milieu
O on se sait si fragile qu'on prvoit les pices d'rechange
D'ici peu de temps on s'achtera des jambes en famille le dimanche
O tout le monde ne mange pas sa faim lieu de conflit sans fin
Crer dans le fond pour qu'un seul parvienne ses fins
La misre comme moyen o le suppos mort esclavage svit encore en divers lieux
Tu vois ! Il y a toujours des grains de poussire vaniteux qui s'prennent pour des dieux
Bienvenue pas Gattaca mais presque o seul l'lu vite la presse
On parque le reste en attendant que vieillesse se manifeste,
O on parle prslection, d'amlioration, transformation
Gntique, c'est pas magnifique une armada de super soldats de plomb
O on s'tue pour un bifteck ou un bifton
O on entend le mensonge aveugle, on voit pas l'illusion, envole la laine du mouton
Je t'annonce le sombre, parce que le clair, j'prfrerais qu'tu le dcouvre,
Allez petit ! Lance toi t'inquite fonce ! Moi, j'te couvre
Beyonc - Chorus:

Por un bello embusteroTook me a while but I'm finally here
So I just wanna testify, make it crystal clear
See I've been picked out to be picked on
Talked about, out my friends mouths
I've been beat down til He turned my life around
Seems like I always fall short of being worthy
Cause I ain't good enough but He still loves me
I aint no superstar, the spotlight aint shining on me
Cause I ain't good enough but He still loves me
I used to wake up somedays
And wish I'd stayed asleep
Cause I went to bed on top of the world
Today the world's on top of me
Now everybody's got opinions
They ain't been in my position
That it breaks my heart
When I hear what they have to say about me
Seems like I always fall short of being worthy
Cause I ain't good enough but He still loves me
I aint no superstar, the spotlight aint shining on me
Cause I ain't good enough but He still loves me
And I'm not perfect
Yes I do wrong
I'm trying my best
But it aint good enough
Shunned by the world
If I don't succeed
Cause I aint good enough
But He still loves me
If you ain't worthy just raise your hands
And let me know that you understand
That we are all so blessed to be loved, loved
Stand for him or fall for anything
Cause through his eyes we all look the same
What will we do without pain?
Seems like I always fall short of being worthy
Cause I ain't good enough but He still loves me
I aint no superstar, the spotlight aint shining on me
Cause I ain't good enough but He still love me
I'm not perfect
Yes I do wrong
I'm trying my best
But it aint good enough
Shunned by the world
If I dont succeed
Cause I aint good enough
But He still loves me
I'm not perfect
Yes I do wrong
I'm trying my best
But it aint good enough
Shunned be the word
If I don't succeed
Cause I ain't good enough
But He still loves me
No, I ain't good enough
But He still loves me
No, I ain't good enough
But He still loves me
No, I aint good enough
But He still loves me
No, I ain't good enough
But He still loves me

To the left, to the left
To the left, to the left
Everything you own in the box to the left
In the closet that's my stuff, yes
If I bought it please don't touch
And keep talking that mess, that's fine
But could you walk and talk at the same time?
And it's my mine name that is on that tag
So remove your bags let me call you a cab
Standing in the front yard telling me
How I'm such a fool, talking about
How I'll never ever find a man like you
You got me twisted
You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I could have another you in a minute
Matter fact he'll be here in a minute, baby
You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I can have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second get to thinking you're irreplaceable
So go ahead and get gone
And call up that chick and see if she's home
Oops, I bet ya thought that I didn't know
What did you think I was putting you out for?
Because you was untrue
Rolling her around in the car that I bought you
Baby you dropped them keys
Hurry up before your taxi leaves
Standing in the front yard telling me
How I am such a fool, talking about
How I'll never ever find a man like you
You got me twisted
You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I can have another you in a minute
Matter fact he'll be here in a minute, baby
You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I'll have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second get to thinking you're irreplaceable
So since Im not your everything
How about I'll be nothing, nothing at all to you
Baby I won't shed a tear for you, I won't lose a wink of sleep
'Cause the truth of the matter is replacing you is so easy
To the left, to the left
To the left, to the left
To the left, to the left

Matter fact he'll be here in a minute
You could pack all your things, we're finished
(You must not know 'bout me)
'Cause you made your bed, now lay in it
(You must not know 'bout me)
I can have another you by tomorrow
Don't you ever for a second get to thinking you're irreplaceableRemember the first day when I saw your face

always runnin' the streets
he's playing the game
and he'll never love me
you say that he's fake but why does it feel so real
Hook
no matter what you say i ain't goin no where
no matter what you think i will always be there
the love that we share it lives inside of me
no matter what you hear it's all in the past
no matter what you feelin this love is gone last
the heart of his soul it breeds inside of me
Chorus
My man, he makes me feel so special
My man, he makes me feel so precious
My man, he makes me feel wonderful
My man, with him I'm so comfortable
My man, he makes me feel so special
My man, he makes me feel so precious
My man, he makes me feel wonderful
He's thugged out but he's my man

You know I'm feelin you tonight,

Where we can get to know each other better
I'll go and tell my girls
You go and tell your boys
Before we leavin' tell me whats it' gon' be (repeat 1x)
Chorus until fadeHe is always laughin' and flirting with me
And you act like you don't even care
As a matter of fact you've been real distance lately
Actin' like I'm not even there
He says that you don't deserve a girl like me
I'm startin' to think that he's right
Baby, if you let him take me from you
I guess I finally see
If you let him take me from you
You never wanted me
If this happen
Then it proves that your love was never true
If you let him take me from you, baby
If you let him take me from you
Why is that, when we go out
Out together as one big crew
I tried to chill with you, dance or whatever
And your homeboy is more interested than you
He pays more attention to me than you lately
I'm tended to pay attention too
Baby, if you let him take me from you
I guess I finally see
If you let him take me from you
You never wanted me
If this happen
Then it proves that your love was never true
If you let him take me from you, baby
If you let him take me from you
Boy, when I tried to show some affection to you
You act like you got better things to do
You want some lovin' that's when it's cool
But, baby boy, I'm not a fool
Baby, if you let him take me from you
I guess I finally see
If you let him take me from you
You never wanted me
(Wanted me)
If this happen, then it proves that your love was never true
(No, no, no, how could you let him take your woman)
If you let him take me from you, baby
If you let him take me from you
(How you gonna let him take me from you)
If you let him take me from you
I guess I finally see
If you let him take me from you
No, no, you never wanted me
If this happen, then it proves that yourl ove was never true
(Just, let me go, let me go, just let me know)
If you let him take me from you, baby
If you let him take me from you
If you let him take me from you
