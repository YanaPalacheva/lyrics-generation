Today I read the paper and it said tru life caught a case
They said they found the victim with a knife stuck in his face

So you can back and shake it on the field and show them whats up

You niggas better follow the instructions

Everybody cant do it the way I do it

Till the sun come out
A nigga playin playin
We make the guns come out
Now my question is
Who they gonna blame
When Im back number one on the Billboard again
Shit shift now the game done change
Since Mike made Thriller and Prince made Purple Rain
I guess I make the kids wanna slang
And NWA made the West Coast bang
Nah its just music man its just music
Now get your ass on the dance floor and move it

Let me see you put your hands up in the air
I said get up
Girl you look good
I want to get to know you better
You look good in them jeans
And them red stilettos
You got a Bentley
Coupe booty baby
I want to drive
See I tell you what mileage is
When Im inside
Ima take you for a spin
You know round and round
Switch gears till your love come down
I take you to the point of no return
If you listen you learn
Just how a nigga earn
I got money to burn
While the Gap Band play
She dropped the bomb on me
Its up and down
And up and down
Gracefully
Rick James would have said she a brick house
Or Fifty you should go home to see

Its the return of the heartless creative monster
Eminem dre fifty
Shady aftermath - Play this on the radio
Niggas cant tell me nothing son
I was broke fucked up now what I dare u say something
I break your fucking neck anyone of these niggas son
Im waiting
And Im on ur heels Mr carter
I heard u
U want me to die ugly Ok
Dont end up on the list be a missing person like camrom ja joe who want some
Who want it What upI can hear your heartbeat youre scared yeah yeah
I can hear your heartbeat youre scared
I can hear your heartbeat youre scared yeah yeah
I can hear your heartbeat youre scared
You see Im a psycho a sicko Im crazy
I said I got my knife pulled Ill kill you if you make me
They wanna see me shot up locked up and cage me
Ill come back bigger stronger and angry
Look look Ive come from a different crew
You fuck with me Ill get to you
A clip or two Ill put through you
Cause I aint got shit to do
Pistol poppin a pussy drop
Drama never ever stop
Eenie meenie miney moe
Now tre pound or forty-four
Pick a strap the Tec the Mac
The hawk Ill stab it in your back
Ill blow your brains I know your name
And where you rest Ill make a mess
The hollow tips hit ya chest
Call for blood to E-M-S
Come pick you up
You know you fucked when
You get on a stretcher
Cause Ill come in to ICU
To see you off to heaven
The system I done been through it
Theres nothing new to me
They locked me up they let me out
You seen this in the movies
The criminals be criminals
Why they up in corrections
They come home get a nine
Nigga commit trying perfection
Its murder when they found the gun now they doing ballistic
But they cant find a fingerprint the shits going terrific
Get so close to your target that its really hard to miss it
You see Im a psycho a sicko Im crazy
I said I got my knife pulled Ill kill you if you make me
They wanna see me shot up locked up and cage me
Ill come back bigger stronger and angry
Man these are average raps Im keeping the savage batch hidden
The can of whoop ass with the ShadyAftermath lid
You pop off the top its like opening vats of acid
Beat the Octomom to death with a Cabbage Patch Kid
Attack a snatch yeah theres something to jack a batch in
Impregnated then shoot up the embryo sack with Mac-tens
Triplets quadruplets and a couple of back-to-back twins
Dead fetuses falling out all over Jack is back again
The Rippers at your service girl I can see that youre nervous
But I barely scratched the surface like my last batch of girlfriends
That I buried in my fucking backyard still trying to dig their way out
I foam like an attack dog how late you wanna stay out
Its past your curfew when its dark Im searching for you in the park
Shady murdered him another virgin he just hit his mark
He met his quota for the month they found Dakota all rolled up
Inside a bag he probably dragged the body for about a block
Disappeared without a trace no DNA no not a drop
Cause me and Dre and fifty we will never get caught by the cops
CSI they hate us but they gotta give a lot of props
The drama pops grab the butcher knife from off the counter tops
You see Im a psycho a sicko Im crazy
I said I got my knife pulled Ill kill you if you make me
They wanna see me shot up locked up and cage me
Ill come back bigger stronger and angry
Im as ill as can be
My appeal is to serial killers what a pill is to me
Killing so villainously
Still as maniacal on the NyQuil and psycho as Michael Myers
You know what were like on the motherfucking mic so try us
And youre gonna find out what the fuck were like with pliers
Its operation time they got him hooked up to wires
Squeezing he bleeding wheezing breathing he half dead
He must aint know but now he know how Shady the Math is
Even murderous tactics get better with practice
Lead showers gun powder feel the talons burn burn
School of arts Julliard you better learn learn
Chris Reeves in his grave yeah homie turn turn
Im debating mutilating the lady
Youve been waiting for Shady and Fif aint no duplicating it baby
Theres a baby in the dryer theres a torso in the washer
I think it might even belong to Portia when I tossed her
Arms and legs in the garbage cause the rest of her I lost her
Her head is in the disposal with Jessicas I squashed her
I put her on the ringer and hung her over the wash tub
When Im through with Ricky itll be blood that hell cough up
The hard rock Ill soft up get caught up and get washed up
In Detroit or Norfolk witness this shit end up nauseous
Look deep in my eye see many many men die
I swing gem stars faster than a Samurai
You see Im a psycho a sicko Im crazy
I said I got my knife pulled Ill kill you if you make me
They wanna see me shot up locked up and cage me
Ill come back bigger stronger and angryI gave her books to read fed her mind with knowledge
Gave her street smarts shit you cant get in college
Shes a reflection of me so you know she the shit
If Im a star she a star if Im rich she rich
Thats my dog
I tell her stay she wanna go I tell her go she wanna stay
Thats my dog
You know a bitch dont usually mean nothing to me thats right
But thats my dog I go left she go right I go up she go down
She couldnt listen that she aint around
So ungrateful screaming I hate you
She must got amnesia bitch I made you
Now just think just think that couldve been you
Just think that shouldve been you
Yeah with me I share the world with you
But you aint ride with a rider so I aint fucking with you
Say say say girl come here no you no her yeah you go

And now girl you lose cause I aint fucking with ya

Shopping sprees drop top hair blowing in the wind

Living lavish instead its your girlfriend
But you tripping while we sipping
In the back of the club big tipping
She say it hurts when you supposed to win then you lose
You were supposed to be sure baby you was confused

House cars kids and a pet name for you
Pussycat told you Id make it you aint believe

Dont think Im crazy cause I dont fear man
Cause I fear when I kill a man God wont understand
I got a head full of evil thoughts am I Satan
I been couldve killed these niggas Im still waitin
In the telly with two whores Benz with two doors
thirty-two karats in the cross no flaws
You see me in the hood I got at least two guns
I carry the Glock Tony carry my M-one
Hold me down nigga OGs tryin to rock me
Ds waiting for my response to lock me
This is my hustle nigga dont knock me
You need some shit with a banana clip to try and stop me

My attitude is gangsta so I stand some beef
You wanna get acquainted with me you wanna know me
From three point range with a Glock I shoot better then Kobe
See a nigga standing next to me he probably my Co-D
See a bitch getting in my whip she probably gon blow me
See the flow is like a thirty-eight its special yall
Country boy tell ya Im finna blow
Im more like a pimp than a trick you know
See Im in this for the paper but I dont love the hoes
Niggas broke in the hood worried about mines
Grown ass men wearing starter piece shines
You know them little pieces with the little stones
Got little clientele fiends call your cell phones
When the gossip starts Im always the topic
You too old for that shit dawg wont you stop it
Shorty I been watching you watching me

I need you to care for me and
I need you to want me to win
I need to know where Im heading cause I know where Ive been
The flow is bone crushing its nothing I come up with something
Come through your strip fronting stunting
Its something you want seven hundred and forty-five chrome spinners
Haters hate that Im winning
Man Ive been hot from the beginning
Motherfuckers envy the kid control your jealousy
Cause I cant control my temper Im finna catch a felony
Pistol in hand homie Im down to get it popping
Once I squeeze the first shot you know I aint stopping
Till my clip is empty Im simply
Not that nigga you should try your luck with or fuck with
Hollow-tip shells struck you with your bones broken guns smoking still locing
What nigga lay your ass down paramedics get you up feeling
Right now Im on the edge so dont push me
I aim straight for your head so dont push me
Fill your ass up with leadso dont push me
I got something for your ass keep thinking Im pussy
Right now Im on the edge so dont push me
I aim straight for your head so dont push me
Fill your ass up with leadso dont push me
I got something for your ass keep thinking Im pussy
I done lost my bigger nigga and I didnt cry
To young to understand the consequences of a man
Living a lie I gotta get that money
Ill be damned if Im bummy
Gotta watch my back around these niggas cause they funny
twenty years of watching my mamas tears got my heated heavily weeded
Smoking that bong cause I need it
These niggas dont want me balling they want me buried
Bogged in the dirt from shots flurried
Laying with bugs under my shirt
I got plans to hop up in that Hummer
Cause Im a stunner I sit back and wonder
When them angels gonna call my number under
My chest is a heart of a lion
I aint lying bounty hunters got me flying
With my iron high as a giant
Im running from nothing my stomach is touching what Im clutching
To give you more than a concussion end of discussion
My blood is colder so Im bolder
Hennessy and soda hood on my shoulder
Look in the mirror I see a soldier
Right now Im on the edge so dont push me
I aim straight for your head so dont push me
Fill your ass up with leadso dont push me
I got something for your ass keep thinking Im pussy
Right now Im on the edge so dont push me
I aim straight for your head so dont push me
Fill your ass up with leadso dont push me
I got something for your ass keep thinking Im pussy
These are my ideas this is my sweat and tears
This is shit that I saw with my eyeballs my ears
This is me whos gotta be what you see on TV
What you hear on CD what appears easy
Man these teenie boppers see me on these magazine covers
In these beanies and these rags living fantasies
Fronting like its all fun and games til the shoot em up bang
And you see your brains hang and you see we aint playing
Aint saying we aint laying down at night and aint praying
I bullied my way in this game man Im done playing
Man Im done saying that Im done playing
Imma start laying into these motherfucking cocksuckers
Theres no way Im back down like a god damn coward
I cant how would I look as a man bowing to his knees
Like the mad cow disease let somebody lash out at me
And not lash back out at em please
Oh whoa yo ho hold up oh no not me not Marshall
You wanna see Marshall Ill show you Marshall
I try to show you art but you just pick it apart
So I see I have to start showing you fucking old farts
A whole other side I wanted to not show you
So you know youre not dealing with some fucking marshmallow
Little soft yellow punk pussy whose hearts Jello cause
Right now Im on the edge so dont push me
I aim straight for your head so dont push me
Fill your ass up with leadso dont push me
I got something for your ass keep thinking Im pussy
Right now Im on the edge so dont push me
I aim straight for your head so dont push me
Fill your ass up with leadso dont push me
I got something for your ass keep thinking Im pussy

Could I count on you to be there to support me mentally
If I went back to a hoopty from a Benz would you poof and disappear like
Some of my friends
If I was hit and I was hurt would you be by my side
If it was time to put in work would you be down to ride
Id get out and peel a nigga cap and chill and drive
Im asking questions to find out how you feel inside
If I aint rap cause I flipped burgers at Burger King
Would you be ashamed to tell your friends you feelin me

If I was with some other chick and someone happened to see

Man if I get a shot I could make it to the top damn what if
If I got on some pretty boy s like Puffy
Nz in the hood man they just wouldnt love me
If I wore a suit every day like Jay-Z
Nz would think I blew up my fin head and went crazy
If I put diamonds in my teeth like Baby
I wouldnt stand a chance of tryin to sell like Shady
If I put out bulls joints like AZ
Every chance nz get theyd try and play me
But I move around with a little three hundred and eighty
A n try to stunt a n get sprayed be
If I smoked weed all day like Snoop do
Id see the world different through my dilated pupils
If I bust dance moves on you like Usher
Nz did say fifty that aint gangsta f ya

Man I watched the sun go up but come down sayin what if
Man I watched the tide roll in and roll out sayin what if
Homey I play the block tryin to get my packs off sayin what if
Man if I get a shot I could make it to the top damn what if
What if I had blockbuster flicks like Will Smith
And all the backpack nz loved me like Mos Def
Id probably be a cool a n like Ice Cube
Picture me in this flick right now lookin so cool
What if I was a low key n just laid back
Hustle to keep a homey round somebody to hold the gat
Man what if Halle Berry was my next baby moms
S Id give that child support up with no problems
If I caught a case and jumped bail Id get caught
Cause Im that n everybody know from New York
But if I was the new rap n you didnt know
Youd be sayin Damn that kid got a sick flow
What if I just cruised through your hood on twenty-twos
Bumpin Curtis May field or Marvin somethin smooth
And if I let the top down on the Azure
Yeah thatd make you sick to your stomach Im sure ha ha
Man I watched the sun go up but come down sayin what if
Man I watched the tide roll in and roll out sayin what if
Homey I play the block tryin to get my packs off sayin what if
Man if I get a shot I could make it to the top damn what ifYeah ladies and gentlemen

Ask a fan about me they say fifty we love em

My papa never bothered to show me what it was to be a man
Hed just pop another bottle and smoke up a half a gram
I would hop in my Impala and ride all through the night
That gave my homeboy light so when you do it do it right
My fingernails still filled with cocaine residue
I still got the heart to go and bust me a head or two
No other solution you think we hollerin and hootin
Until you wake up and then you got ta hear bout these shootings
I take a pull from Incomprehensible when he put the clip in my pocket
Before I take another bullet Im gonna pull it and pop it
And if its beef my nigga then let your guns do your talkin
The graveyard has got plenty room for a coffin
They say that we responsible for boostin the crime rate
They say that we the reason that these young niggas buyin weight
But Im gonna keep this glock on my waist til my dayin days

Aint it amazing how crazy the hood done made me
Feels like my emotions are froze I stay GD up
Its the things I done seen and shit I been through

Lloyd Banks you know
Cause a nigga thuggin dont mean he dont
Dont wanna see you smile baby
I wanna be the reason you smile
I wanna be the reason you smile
I wanna be the reason you smile
After you wipe away your tears and dry your eyes
Im gettin the feelin you wanna take revenge
From the conversations we have and the way it ends
You wanna discuss me in front of your lady friends
Thats why its just me and my Mercedes Benz
It all depends maybe if we make amends
We can start from scratch
Learn to control your temper and remarks in fact
We plan to be platonic with our hearts in tact
So every time we separate somebodys marchin back
Youre amazing in the sack eyes slanted like youre Asian
But youre black God bless whoever gave you alla that
If you seen her from the back youd understand why dis feel like that
And aint a flaw to her toes the Lord knows
Her pussy good enough to miss award shows
And I aint gotta say nothin she just knows
By the way I look at her to take off all her clothes up and down
Whenever Im not around and you feelin down
Let the thought of me be
I wanna be the reason you smile
I dont wanna see you frown like them kids watch a clown
I wanna bring you joy and be
I wanna be the reason you smile
Baby you know my style you know how I get down
I provide by any means to be
I wanna be the reason you smile
We done been through ups and downs had drama for a while
Im just happy Im around to be
I wanna be the reason you smile
The main reason I been lookin at you pitiful
What about the half of this shit I done did to you
Violated and tiptoed into a crib or two
Ive come clean to be a bigger individual
Even though youre busy boo the evenings when I visit you
Kinda makes me feel lucky cause I see niggaz
When you tease em with your physical
She wanna rack up her brooms I aint got no more room left
Wild drama section eight princess
My foreign chick bad but she been stressed
Cause its hard to communicate
Cause she dont speak-a no English
I been around the world from state to state
But now Im back bustin in your bathroom
Got you laughin in your shower cap
Lets get it on
Cause Im leavin in a hour fly-through
Dont matter shes mad even when I holla back
All I really need your attention for a while
And I bet you I can make you smile
Whenever Im not around and you feelin down
Let the thought of me be
I wanna be the reason you smile
I dont wanna see you frown like them kids watch a clown
I wanna bring you joy and be
I wanna be the reason you smile
Baby you know my style you know how I get down
I provide by any means to be
I wanna be the reason you smile
We done been through ups and downs had drama for a while
Im just happy Im around to be
I wanna be the reason you smile
Whenever Im not around and you feelin down
Let the thought of me be

Back up chump you know Biggie Smalls grips it quick
And kicks it quick you know how black niggas get
With the hoods fatigues with the boots with trees
Smokin weed flippin kis makin crazy Gs
Hittin buckshots at niggas that open spots
On the avenue take my loot and Im baggin you
Pimpin hoes that drive Volvos and Rodeos
Flash the Roll make her wet in her pantyhose
Damn a nigga style is unorthodox
Grip the glock when I walk down the crowded blocks
Just in case a nigga wanna act out

Thats a real nigga for ya
We the realest nigga
fifty Cent and BIG my nigga
Dont try to act like you dont feel a nigga
Biggie yo nigga fifty yo nigga
Squeeze the trigga leave a nigga fa sho
When we smoke spliffs we pack four-fifths
Just in case dread wanna riff
He get a free lift to the cemetary rough very
Not your ordinary we watch you get buried
Thats a real nigga for ya
Get mad do a quarter flip the script and rip your lawyer
Spit at the DA cause fuck what she say
She dont give a fuck about your ass anyway
Up North found first stop for the town
of fist-skill where the hand skills are real ill
Youll be a super Hoover doo-doo stain remover
Ha hahhh yo G pass the ruler
Chorus
When I was young my MO was to go hail the Henny
And even my PO she called me the Ginger Bread Man
I cut ya new case and tell her ass catch me if you can
Dont let your people feel your awkward

Real BIG style watch the kid break it down
Check it thou shalt not fuck wit North C Papa
fifty Cent Ill break yo punk ass off propa
Theres new place like home New York - New York
I run this city I dont dance around like Diddy
Niggas is giddy till they act smack silly
Or spray wit the Mack Milly they dont want drama really
Pushy niggas get hard lip syncing my lyrics like Milly Vanilly
Even the hood they feel me gun cocked hah Im on fire
Niggas out in Philly they feel me they bump my shit
Even bootlegged you know bump my shit bitchIntro
Yeah Ha Ha
Chorus
Man everywhere I go I mean like everywhere I be
I hear niggaz runnin they mouth you should hear how they talk bout me
I know Boo Boo I mean fifty he a grimey nigga
fifty shot my brother Im a find that nigga
We dont see his punk ass unless he on TV
Yeah he did my brother dirty but he dont wanna see me
Member Rydell from KP thought he was his man
Put him on the table to bag up he beat him for grams
How you think he got that money for that Chalk Gray Land
That nigga robbin and stealin everything that he can
Chorus
Man everywhere I go I mean like everywhere I be
I hear hoes runnin they mouth you should hear how they talk bout me
Yeah I know Curtis he used to fuck with my friend
Used to come through my projects pick her up in the Benz
Niggaz from my buildin always used to ask about him
Like she in and out of town right that niggaz get down right
I used to say all I know is the nigga get money
And you standin in my way excuse me dummy
Ronda she told me that nigga a freak
And McDonalds aint the only thing that he eat
Chorus
Man everywhere I go I mean like everywhere I be
I hear everybody runnin they mouth you should hear how they talk bout me
I love fifty Cent thats my dad
But even my mom talk about him bad
She says since he blew up he changed for sure
Hes really fascinated with these fancy hoes
I dont know why but there personalities collide
And my dad will swallow blood before he swallows his pride
You know the kids in my class they be sayin hes crazy
They just like him cause he rollin with Dr Dre and Shady
Chorus
Man everywhere I go I mean like everywhere I be
I hear niggaz runnin they mouth you should hear how they talk bout me
Man fifty fucked up I mean real fucked up
He left us in the hood we fucked up
Still actin like he in the street tellin niggaz they cant eat
You know this motherfucker went and bought Tysons crib
Got Bentleys Ferraris and all that shit
He dont even come through to try and help niggaz out
Thats the bullshit see what Im talkin about
Chorus
Man everywhere I go I mean like everywhere I be
I hear everybody runnin they mouth you should hear how they talk bout me
Thats my Grand baby I love him I raised that boy right
He ran to me cryin sent him back out to fight
Put a battery in his sock go pick up a rock
You aint a chump you want your Grandma to think you a punk
Look at my first Grand baby he is a big rap star
Bought me a house diamonds and a brand new car
I tought him what it takes to go this far
Boy Im the reason you are what you are
Chorus
Man everywhere I go I mean like everywhere I be
I hear everybody runnin they mouth you should hear how they talk bout me
Man everywhere I go I mean like everywhere I be
I hear everybody runnin they mouth you should hear how they talk bout meDont even look at me wrong when I come through the hood
Aint nothin changed still holla at my homies
And when I hit the block I still will kill
And I dont want nigga but I will
If I got to kill
If niggas get to fuckin around if niggas get to fuckin around
Respect come from admiration and fear
You can admire me or you can catch one in ya wig
You see the Testarosa the toasters right on my lap
So if a nigga get out of line a nigga get clapped
I got an arsenal a infantry Im built for this mentally
Thats why Im the general I do what they pretend to do
Front on me now nigga Ill be the end of you
Forget ya enemies and think of what ya friendsll do
I drop a bag off then let a mag off
The Heckler Kochll tear half of ya ass off
Im not for the games Im not for all the playin
The hollow tips rain when I unleash the pain
Get the message from the lions or get the message from the nine
Paint a picture wit words you can see when I shine
Put my back on the wall nigga watch me go for mine
I let twenty-one shots off at the same time yeah
Dont even look at me wrong when I come through the hood
Aint nothin changed still holla at my homies
And when I hit the block I still will kill
And I dont want nigga but I will
If I got to kill
If niggas get to fuckin around if niggas get to fuckin around
Where Im from death is always in the air homie
Nanna love me so you know she say my prayers for me
I come creepin through in the hood wearin Teflon
Hit the corners motherfuckers get left on
Niggas know if not they better check my background
Try and stick me I fill ya back wit mac rounds
Ask Preme nigga fifty dont back down
I keep it funky like fiends in a crack house
Cross the line boy Imma air ya ass out
Screw ya face at me I wan know what thats bout
Nigga I know you aint mad I done came up
And if you are fuck you cause I aint change up
The OGs wanna talk but I dont know these niggas
And I aint did no business wit em I dont owe these niggas
A minute of my time I get it cause I grind
All across the world like the globes mine yeah
Dont even look at me wrong when I come through the hood
Aint nothin changed still holla at my homies
And when I hit the block I still will kill
And I dont want nigga but I will
If I got to kill
If niggas get to fuckin around if niggas get to fuckin around
Konvict
Now tell me have you ever looked up at an instance
And seen a mac aimin atcha head mayne
Before you know it life is flashin reminiscin
And ya body is drippin and full of lead man
I done been there I done cocked that
It aint never been a question Im bout that
Dont go there youll get cocked at
And if ya plan to fuck around then reroute that
Youll never catch me ridin around on these streets
Without a couple metal pieces under my feet
Fully automatic weapons and loaded wit dumb-ds
Stashed up under the carpet like a can of Sea breeze
fifty dont make me ride on these niggas
Cause I will kill dip and hide on these niggas
fifty dont make me ride on these niggas
Cause Ill be long gone like the Ripper so
Dont even look at me wrong when I come through the hood
Aint nothin changed still holla at my homies
And when I hit the block I still will kill
And I dont want nigga but I will
If I got to kill
If niggas get to fuckin around if niggas get to fuckin aroundSomething special unforgettable

She was pregnant by me once glad she didnt have it
Cause I be paying child support now god damn it
Tish was my bitch til she fucked my god brother
I was heated when I heard wanted to go upside his head
It was Christmas I just bought the bitch a sheepskin kid
I was sick to my stomach nigga this is real shit
I aint the sensitive type I aint sit around crying
I caught the bitch on the avenue and punched her in the eye
Call it puppy love Curtis and Janelle in the tree
K-I-S-S-I-N-G
Ds came locked my ass up like a savage
Then came Doobie in the baby carriage
Imagine how it felt summer day pretty blue skies
I gazed mesmerized at her in with green eyes
Im so into you baby we dont even got touch
That the type shit I say when I really want to fuck
Cause her cousin Tisha lived by baby forty
Sold crack before rap so everybody know me
Chase Jus down cut his head the motherfucker owe me
Vicks spinning Cheeks was the hottest rapper in the hood
I aint hate but on the low I didnt think he was good
We wore Timberland boots carhartt suits
You can tell a nigga paid when his Filas shoes suede
Ock a ceaser or a fade kept a pistol or a blade
Try to flip a sixty two like every couple days
I get knocked I come home its all a part of the game
Catch a snitch cut a snitch or put one in his frame
Its like every other summer I was back and forth to jail
Telling nanna Im copping out so I dont need bail
Just the convesary put the money orders in the mail
Call it puppy love curtis and Deawn in the tree
K-I-s-s-I-n-g
Call it puppy love
Call it puppy love
She came to see me on the alley wrote me letters all the time
And I responded to the letters so she stayed on my mind
Told myself Ima grind
As soon as I get out that paper what Im about
After four months home I had the Lan I shine
Two months later I copped the Benz my nine
Stay all cocked even when it hot TAZ out
TNT on the block make yourself get knocked

I sit and think of things to say that may make you smile
Or give you gifts from my heart to reflect my style
Or slang I use when we build may change how you talk
And if Im focused while Im strokin I could change how you walk
Theres a swagger that you calm but when you come from New York

Separate me from the rest I feel like Im the best
If theres a price to pay for feelin you I pay that twice

With two hoes in the whip looking like flipThe business is entertainment
And what entertain the customers is the sight of blood
Cam I mean I was bein nice to him okay Ill get him
You should worship the ground I walk on

Attempted get a year on probation
Cam are you clear what you facin
You must aint hear me I done told you Im a boss
Im eatin good but I aint chubby like Ricky Ross
Word on the street is that fiftys not Jay
And Cam better stay out of his way
Everythings cooler than a fan till you rolled on
Have you in the ICU tryin to hold on
in the waitin room been waitin so long
Till they hear the flat line the doc say hes gone hes gone
Thats up
When they say hes gone
He dead
Well he knew that could happen with the kid
This is graveyard music right here ya dig
This is not competition this is
Career endin mind bendin Southside ya finished
Now look laughin at Cam down on Lennox
They heard what he did but they dont know why he did it
I have eighty of them boys with black flags
Come through with black
And have you zipped up in black bags
For a second he was hot now he cold
I apply pressure on until they fold
But never mind me man thats just how I be
The game got me trained they call me the hustle man
And like fame my style will live forever
They thought I crossover cause they dont know no better
I think they think Im laxed now cause I got the cheddar
Till I return back trust me its nothin
Everythings cooler than a fan till you rolled on
Have you in the ICU tryin to hold on
in the waitin room been waitin so long
Till they hear the flat line the doc say hes gone hes gone
When they say hes gone
It shouldnt have to be like this man
Dipset Cam stay up Im not gonna destroy Dipset
Just gotta make changes from now on Jimmys the boss of Dipset
And Juelz is the capo hes gone
Cams demoted to soldier we like Jimmy better anyway
Ballin come on man

And I dont want nigga but I will
If I got to kill

Respect come from admiration and fear
You can admire me if you can catch one in your wig
You see the Testarossa the toasters right on my lap
So if a nigga get out of line a nigga get clapped
I got an arsenal a infantry Im built for this mentally
Thats why Im the general I do what they pretend to do
Front on me now nigga Ill be the end of you
Forget ya enemies and think of whatcha friendsll do
I drop a bag off then let a mag off
The Heckler Kochll tear half of your ass off
Im not for the games Im not for all the playin
The hollow tips rain when I unleash the pain
Get the message from the lions or get the message from the nine
Paint a picture wit words you can see when I shine
Put my back on the wall nigga watch me go for mine
I let twenty-one shots off at the same time yeah
Oh dont even look at me wrong
When I come through the hood
Aint nothin changed still holla at my homies
Oh and when I hit the block I still will kill
And I dont want nigga but I will
If I got to kill
If niggas get to fuckin around

Where Im from death is always in the air homie
Nanna love me so you know she say my prayers for me
I come creepin through the hood wearin Teflon
Hit the corners motherfuckers get left on
Niggas know if not they better check my background
Try and stick me I fill ya back wit mac rounds

Cross the line boy Imma air your ass out

When I come through the hood

Now tell me have you ever looked up at an instance
And seen a mac aimin atcha head mayne
Before you know what life is flashin and reminiscin
Your body is drippin and full of lead mayne
I done been there I done cocked that
It aint never been a question Im bout that
Dont go there you can cock that
And if you plan to fuck around then reroute that
Youll never catch me ridin around on these streets
Without a couple metal pieces under my feet
Fully automatic weapons and loaded wit dumb-ds
Stashed up under the carpet like a can of Seabreeze
fifty dont make me ride on these niggas
Cause I will kill dip and hide on these niggas
fifty dont make me ride on these niggas
Cause Ill be long gone like the Ripper
So dont even look at me wrong

Oh and when I hit the block I still will kill
And I dont want nigga but I will

Spend her life savings in a day cause she likes me
Commitment for me

Confusion occurs coming up in the cold world
Daddy aint around probably out committing felonies
My favorite rapper used to sing Check check out My Melody
I wanna live good so shit I sell dope
For a four finger ring one of them gold ropes
Nana told me if I passed Id get a sheepskin coat
If I can move a few packs Id get the hat now thatd be dope
Tossed and turned in my sleep that night
Woke up the next mornin niggas had stole my bike
Different day same shit aint nothing good in the hood
Id run away from this bitch and never come back if I could
Hate it or love it the underdogs on top

Ill fo-five em kill a nigga on my song
And really do it thats the true meaning of a ghostwriter
Ten Gs ll take your daughter out of Air Forces
Believe you me homey I know all about losses
Im from Compton wear the wrong colors be cautious
One phone callll have your body dumped in Marcy
I stay strapped like car seats been banging
Since my lil nigga Rob got killed for his Barkleys
Thats ten years I told Pooh in ninety-five
Ill kill you if you try me for my Air Max ninety-fives
Told Banks when I met him Imma ride
And if I gotta die Id rather homicide
I aint have fifty cent when my grandmama died
Now Im going back to Cali with my Jacob on

From the beginning to the end losers lose
Winners win this is real we aint got to pretend
The cold world that we in is full of pressure and pain
Enough of me nigga now listen to Game
Used to see Five-O throw the crack by the bench
Now Im fuckin with five-zero its all starting to make sense
My moms happy she aint gotta pay the rent
And she got a red bow on that brand new Benz
Waiting on Sha Money to land sitting in the Range
Thinking how they spent thirty million dollars on airplanes
When theres kids starving
Pac is gone and Brenda still throwing babies in the garbage
I wanna know Whats Going On like I hear Marvin
No schoolbooks they used that wood to build coffins
Whenever Im in the booth and I get exhausted
I think what if Marie Baker got that abortion
I love you ma

It is what it is man
Sirens flashin you know the routine the crime scene taped off
It started out a robbery they blew half his face off
They seen him shinin course full of diamonds he bought
Grindin his foot slipped off the ladder of success he was climbin
The Ds came through asked the niggas if they knew what happened
Somehow my name end up in anything that involves clappin
Detectives at my mama crib they say they wanna question me
They put me in a line up last time and they arrested me
When it come to cookin coke they know I got the recipe
I turn a quarter to a half thats why they mess with me
Im the neighborhood pusher I move packs to make stacks
A little weed a little X a little H a little crack
Figure I push it to the limit take this shit to the max
Navy blue vest on navy blue Yankee hat
Calm in my palm fully loaded fire arm
First to let off last to run every time its on
I tell niggas to suck my dick
Get the fuck out my face cause I dont need em
Cause theyre never around when Im down
Shot and Im bleedin
What niggas yeah

Sayin they gonna do me somethin now you know thats a lie
Nigga you look at me wrong Ill let that hammer fly
Im rich I still wake up with crime on my mind
Queens nigga put it down like Pappy Mason in his prime
When I say move nigga move or get caught in the cross fire
Up a fence runnin cut my fuckin hand on a barb wire
Shits crazy just a different day its the same shit
Hollow tip part in ya head leave ya whole fuckin brain split
They sit they see me in the Ashton Martin
Whats the matter they cant get that hoopty started
Thought they was grindin well goddamn where that money at
Thought you was fucked cause you was lettin paper stack
You aint a hustler matter of fact yous a busta

It aint my fault you cant break it down the way I break it down
Listen you can call me what you want black and ugly
But you cant convince me the Lord dont love me
When my cds drop they sell the best
You call it luck why cant it just be Im blessed
Im a trackstar runnin through life chasin my dream
I may even trade in a mic in for a triple beam
I zone off thinkin is there really heaven or hell
So what happens to a changed man who dies in a cell
I need no answers to these questions cause time will tell
Got a date with destiny shes more than a girl
Dont much good come from me but my music
Is a gift given from God so Ima use it Yeah
Chorus
I just reach for style Im hot I breaks it down
It aint my fault you cant break it down the way I break it down
Some days Im in the crowd all by myself
Bunch of niggas around Im still by myself
Im drink off in the crowd by myself
Thinkin bout nothin more than life what else
These days its hard to tell who really cares for me
So you when hear this song you should say a prayer for me
I put a message in my music hope it brightens your day
If times are hard when you hear it know youll be okay
A OG told me Gods favorites have a hard time
You out the hood thats good now stay on the grind

Lights on or lights off she like it from behind
So seductive you should see the way she whine
Her hips in slow mo on the floor when we grind

Run the light then pop at Jake trust me son niggas will go hard for that cake
These thirsty niggas will lurk then youll have to catch em and murk em

Chorus
That house party off the hook until the shots go off
Well thats what you get for stuntin on my block show off
You shit out of luck if niggas catch you slippin

In the mornin roll over and we can start over
Chorus
fifty Cent
Yeah I called just to say hope you havin a nice day
Youre special I get into you oops I mean Im into you
Every chance I get I find time to spend with you
Jet to bring you to me just to watch a movie
Better yet to watch you climb into the jacuzzi
Bubbles in the bath don in the glass
Funny how time flies when you full of laughs
Its fun but before long a nigga gotta dash
For the lifestyle I live a nigga need cash
To come quick so I dont fuck with the stash
I know you like pumps and boots
I like jeeps and coupes so I grind all the time just gimme some loot
I put a spell on you I like to call it a spell
In the bedroom workin it well I dont kiss and tell
But I dont care if you kiss and tell
You can tell your girlfriend the detailsMan
You know where the niggas be at right
Take me to em
Chorus
All through the hood I keep hearin niggas sayin
Im supposed to die tonight pup pup pup pup pup pup
Niggas come put a hit out and they talkin like the shit okay
pup pup pup pup pup pup
Im down to ride tonight
We rollin whip stolen AK loaded
Im down to ride tonight
Its smokin street locin locked and loaded
Somebody gon die tonight
This is nothin new I been in the position before
Grandma crib niggas outside of her door
Different day same shit old mac new clip
Thirty two hollow tips gloves no rubber grip
Im a boss but niggas never show no respect
I catch em slippin I have em tongue kissin my tec
Want to come test me pussy boy dont try
Police responds never fast enough the shots fired
Dont be stupid find out who you fuckin wit son
Fore we find out where ya bitch gets her hair and nails done
Its elementary life is but a dream
You know row row ya boat your blood forms a stream
After you get hit you should of thought about the shit
You took that paper you take a life or ya life get took bitch
Sometimes I sit and look at life from a different angle
Dont know if Im Gods child or Im Satans angel
Chorus
In two thousand and two if you asked me to make a wish
I simply would of wished that my music would be a hit
Big said damn niggas want to stick me for my paper
And pray for my downfall I understand it all
But me Im a little more flashy a nigga
So chances are Ima have to blast me a nigga
Im on that teflon vest shit that wild wild west shit
And eighty one one carrot stones in my necklace
I shine so hard I make motherfuckers want to kill me
Every projects and every hood I go they feel me
Know it sounds like rap but this shit is real be
I dont talk that rich shit but nigga Im filthy
When I come out to play had my mom been with me
You could bet your bottom dollar that revolver with me
Homeboy frontin on me will shorten your life span
Hold the mic with my left the knife in my right hand
ChorusYeah

Oh Id lie for you baby
Oh Id die for you baby
I build you up
But if ever I fall down
And I need you to pick me up
Promise me youll be around
Hold me down
Ill build you up
Listen if you let me Ill be the reason you shine
Its a secret I want the world to know that youre mine
But on some real shit communications could be better
So Im writin a song instead of a love letter
They can play it on the radio a hundred times a day
I figure when you hear it you would stop and think of me
I want to get to know ya and be the reason you smile
Girl you know where Im from you know how I get down
When times are tough tell me that Im special
Not rap I mean me that Im special
You know they say diamonds are a girls best friend
Precious stones could you put me before them
If so Ill see to it that they always around
Nothin but the best now how does that sound
If I talk with you when we talk you can keep it
Girl you on my mind all the time its a secret
Baby Ill build you up
Girl if I never show I have you by my side
I build you up
Girl I need to know for sure youre mine
I need to know for sure
Baby Ill build you up
Girl if I never show I have you by my side
I build you up
Girl I need to know for sure youre mine
I need to know for sure
I think about you thinkin that you feel the same way
Was it just my imagination again runnin away
If you ready to ride girl come on lets roll
G-fifty-five fly ma lets go
Its hard to measure the pleasure of havin you in my present
Your smile makes me smile Ill show you my style
We can shop a lil bit I pick out my shit
One pair at a time till your shoe games sick
Now who knows what the future holds well be together probably
For better or worst like Whitney and Bobby
If you want to play house we can play house then
But wait why pretend if you can move in
Before I be your buddy in bed let me be your best friend
Girl its more than lust I want your trust
You keep it real with me Ill keep it real with you
Cause I know with you by my side theres nothin I cant do
Baby Ill build you up
Girl if I never show I have you by my side
I build you up
Girl I need to know for sure youre mine
I need to know for sure
Baby Ill build you up
Girl if I never show I have you by my side
I build you up
Girl I need to know for sure youre mine
I need to know for sureYeah
Yeah we can ride to this
Just lay back crew
Heres a taste of my life its bitter and sweet
I put my heart out to the sounds of the drums and the beat
I put my life on the line when Im out on the street
Put my Teflon on and roll with my heat
I keep my circle nice and small I dont fuck with these clown niggas
In a race for the cheese I run laps around niggas
Soon as I step on stage the crowd applauds
Soon as my sneaker wear in stores Reebok start sore
I aint gotta say Im a boss niggas can tell
The east coast crib the size of a small hotel
The shit journalist write about me get me confused
Have me feelin like the heavy weight champ when he lose
I read somewhere Im homophobic shit
Go through the hood theres mad niggas on my dick
Now we can get hostile or we can do this smooth
TT around I can still make blow move
This is what you call ryder music
All the gangstas are ridin to it
Lets roll I can show ya how we do it
When we ride to that ryder music lets go
Lets go
Last year I woke up a good look damn it feels good
On the low I done fucked half of Hollywood
Had your favorite actress from your favorite shows
In my favorite position you know how it goes
In my Bentley bumpin Prince shit This is When Thugs Cry
This is what it sounds like when hollow tip slugs fly
Homie this is somethin you can ride and smoke to
Stay on point cause niggas will ride and smoke you
Jealousys for women but some niggas is bitch made
They make you want to run across theyre head with a switch blade
They point their finger at me sayin Im bug
My flows crack you listen your fuckin brains on drugs
Look ice drippin on my neck hands grippin on the tec
Fool trippin through the set you can get ya ass whipped
Cards missin out my deck screws loose show respect
You try to come at me kid your ass better come correct
My mama gave birth to a winner I gotta win
Pray to Lord forgive me for my sins
Still thuggin cruisin rims gleamin
Like the stones on my wrist
Zonin guess this is how it feels to be rich
Homie you hustlin backwards if you chasin a bitch
Stupid chase the paper they come with the shit
Im fallin in love with success
Entrepreneur kinda sewer I maneuver the best
Rowin ruger on my lap rubber grip on the handle
Stunt Ill have ya homies burn a rest in peace candle
As wise men speak I listen and learn
A man dies a babys born my niggas the world turns
Rappers I make em sick when I say Im the shit
They mistake my confidence for arrogance they hate on the kid
In ninety-nine I had a vision and made a decision
Bein broke is against my religion now picked up
Chorus Chorus 
Yall niggas know what what yall niggas know what Im about
Yall niggas know find me at my do when the guns come out
I do this all the time stuck with a little shine
Walk with a little nine case I get in a bind
They say Im fuckin crazy they think Im out my mind
Cause Im down to bust a nigga head all the time
Now you know the hoes they know how I roll
In that new Rolls with the suicide doors
twenty-two inch chrome a nigga money low
You try to touch me I put out ya get ya brains blown
You go against the grain pussy and you on ya own
You right there in my zone welcome to the terridome
The ice blowin my chain blood blow in my veins
Blue still in the range Im doin my thang
The semi auto spray run if you get away
Ill find your whereabouts and clap at you another day
Nigga play with the bread get a hole in ya head
You touch a dime of mine thug and your ass dead
In the hood hoopty hate low niggas dont know Im around
Hop out hit em up lay my murder game down
You see me in ya projects one hundred and eighty-sevens in progress
Hard niggas finna soften up when that lead touch em
You cut em once and keep fight fuck it just keep cuttin em
Its real killa instinct kill or be killed
Trust me you dont want to feel how hollow tips feel
Fuck around and get ya cap peeled
Nigga you know the drill Brownsville
Flat bush ground heights Brooklyn Zoo
Feed the wolves they eat the food
And they fathom too
Nigga welcome to the jungle New York New York
Gangstas who signed actually let their guns talk

Im cool but if theres a problem I got extra clips
I dont know karate but I split the bricks
I dont love em loverboy we the shit bitch
Ill come through and touch ya walk out then cut ya
In case your dumbass want to tussle
Are-fifteen co-exist to make the shell case muffle
Scope run youre still dead
Hit your calf hit your ass hit ya back then your head
Contract killer murder for the scrilla
Search find a nigga run up behind a nigga
Shoot car windows out to flat line a nigga
Gun pop heart stop homie this is heavy
You on your way to meet your maker nigga are you ready

Motherfucker you retarded you touch fifty

Were walkin away from a beef in which clearly you started
I said were walkin away did you hear me you want to be thankful
That we aint beefin was to agree and just leave it at that
Thats when me fifty and G-Unit hop back in that bat mobile
It aint gonna be no more rappin its gonna be Reh
Retaliation will be like that Muslim shiite attack
Some where along the line its like me and fifty made a pact
Hes got my back I got his back back
Its almost like were kinda like Siamese twins
Cause when we beef we pull each other in
So well do shit like were conjoined at the hip
Its just unavoidable some of this shit is washable
And some shit will never boil up
And some of it will just simmer at best
If left at home well let it be so there wont be no sit downs
The days that Zino there will no peace discussions with me
There aint gon be no friendly debates over crumpets and tea
Just quit fuckin with me and Ill gladly quit fuckin with you
This bitch is sixteen and do what you gotta do to get through
Without mentionin me youre gonna sing to Jimmy Iovine and Dre and fifty
D-Twizzie Obie and just let it be or well be back with a

Got a money scheme Im plotting in the county and Im with it
You cross me and you goin make a cemetery visit
Thats gangsta you know me I told it cause I live it
Showcases drop when that chopper chop

When drama pop the llama pop
And it wont stop you can run call the cops
They say no niggas know how I be on it

Relapse you fat bitch dont ever try that again

You broke my heart you dirty bitch I wont forget what you did
If you give birth Ill already be in love with your kids

But we have a bond and its not to be broken
We got a love thing where you try to leave me

Your friends talk bad about me bitch you sit there and listen to em
Over and over you hurt me my love is unconditional
They talk to you when you up you down they got nothin to say
But when you call Ill come runnin Ill always take the pain away
They set you up to let you down they crowned you prom queen
Fiddle about me behind your back they call you a fuckin fiend

Plus me beside you no other man can loves you like I do
Call me daddy Ill make you feel good I mean real good
I found pleasure in pleasin you like a real man should
It was written long before it was carved in a tree
Forever me and you baby we were meant to be
Theres more to life than laughter what brought us together was fate
And well be hand in hand when you walk through those pearly gates

Got nowhere to go
Nowhere to run and hide
No matter how hard I try

Man the emotions change so I can never trust a bitch
I tried to help niggas get on they turned around and spit
Right in my face so Game and Buck both can suck a dick
Now when you hear em it may sound like its some other shit
Cause Im not writing anymore they not making hits
Im far from perfect theres so many lessons I done learned
If money is evil look at all the evil I done earned
Im doing what Im supposed to Im a writer Im a fighter
Entrepreneur fresh out the sewer watch me maneuver
Whats it to ya The track I lace it its better than basic
This is my recovery my comeback kid
My life my life
Makes me wanna run away
Theres no place to go
No place to go
All the confusion
Its an illusion like a movie
Got nowhere to go
Nowhere to run and hide
No matter how hard I try
While you were sipping your own Kool-Aid getting your buzz heavy
I was in the fucking sheds sharpening my machete
Sipping on some of that revenge juice getting my taste buds ready
To wolf down this spaghetti or should I say this spaghett-even
I think you fucking meatballs keep on just forgetting
Thought he was finished motherfucker its only the buginning
Hes buggin again hes straight thuggin fuck who hes offending
Hell rip your vocal chords out and have them bitches plugged in the
Motherfucking wall with three thousand volts of electrucity
Now take the other end of em then plug them motherfuckers in each
One of your eye sockets cause I thought you might finally fucking see
Thatll teach you to go voicing your cocksuckin opinion to me
I done put my blood my sweat and my tears in this shit
Fuck letting up youre gonna end up rugretting you ever betted against me
Feels like Imma snap any minute yeah its happening again
Im thinking about just saying
Mother fuck everybody thats up in this bitch but fifty
Cause this is all I know this is why so hard I go
I swear to God I put my heart and soul into this more than anybody knows
Im trapped so all I do is rap but every time I rap Im more trapped
And I rap myself right into this bubble oh I guess its bubble wrap
This is like a vicious cycle my lifes in a crisis
Christ how was I supposed to know shit would turn up like it did
Feels like Im going psycho again
And I might just blow my lid
Shit I almost wish that I would have never made Recovery kid
Cause Im running in circles with
My life my life
Makes me wanna run away
Theres no place to go
No place to go
All the confusion
Its an illusion like a movie
Got nowhere to go
Nowhere to run and hide
No matter how hard I try
I havent been this fucking confused since I was a kid
Sold like forty million records people forgot what I did
Maybe this is for me maybe
Maybe Im supposed to go crazy
Maybe Ill do it three AM in the morning like Shady
Psycho killer Michael Myers Im on fire like a lighter
Try to say this aint classic get your ass kicked mad quick
Wrap your head up in plastic pussy
Now pick the casket dirt nap with the maggots
Its tragic its sad its

Of every fucking thing livin

I represent niggas in the hood gettin rich
man I stack chips and I unload clips
after three Summers in the jail I thought life was hard
some niggas started fightin some niggas found God
you know me started sellin leek in the yard
yo I ran into niggas who used to have Hummers
big as Hell in the joint wearin eighty-six numbers
damm Dog you been in here that long
you could think that but say that and yo ass is dead wrong
a convo is only three words yo whattup
you aint gotta work out to leave this bitch cut up
let a nigga find out you on some goin home shit
and you tryin to bounce without payin a loan shit
some niggas beat cases on the strength of they cream
after the witnesses disappeared on the strength of they team
Im hard as Hell to get along wit so it never fails
a nigga I got beef with end up in the same jail
he had a L rolled in bible paper blowin the lye
I sent him a little kite just to be blowin his high
and when I shot you in NewYork why would I box you now
If I catch you in the yard Ima ox you down
niggas you think is real really cant hold they own
Ill have em on some ET shit tryin to phone home
in here a gemstar is like a Nine Milly chrome
its similar infact theyll both split ya dome
scars are souvenirs niggas always take em home
Chorus
You got blown over the jack that aint gangsta
Your Man ran when you got clapped that aint gangsta
rockin a vest with no gat that aint gangsta
you only a thug when you rap that aint gangsta
niggas jooked you for your track that aint gangsta
you ran to other thugs to get it back that aint gangsta
niggas ran off with your packs that aint gangsta
If you aint bustin ya gat that aint gangsta
Youd call me an Animal if you seen me livin on lock
I stay in a box cats be shook when Im visitin pop-ulation
when I walk by niggas like Fifty dont play Son
yeah somethin really wrong with that nigga
max out Im goin straight for the glock
bust a u-turn Im goin straight to the block
the things thatll happen if niggas say I cant eat
down goes the window out goes the heat
Ill make the whole block look like a fuckin trackmeet
some get it in the leg some get it in the back
some get it in the foot bleed all over their airmax
nigga pump my packs or pay poor tax
its extortion it happens in the hood often
claim more lives than choices free abortions
Rich Nice says I got a problem with the dice
cause I put the title to the Benz on the line twice
I rock shit cause I stay on that block shit
that ninemm Ruger to your knot shit
see the difference is Im real and you not kid
I still stash crack money in my sock shit
yall niggas wanna pop shit I pop clips
leave with your blood on my mink in the drop Six
Guiliani and Pataki cant stop this
since eighty-six my whole clique pop Criss
Chorus
five-five-one BLLLAAAP BLLLAAAP

What up fifty
Coming up I aint have much but I wanted a lot
I had paper for a hoopty but I wanted a drop
So you know I had make something outta nothin
Like turn an empty spot into a crack spot pumpin
Im so hard at nine-teen I bought a Benz I did
The older niggaz really wasnt feelin the kid
Try to find where I live so they could run in my crib
But you cant hustle a hustler I peeped it and slid
Back then Niggaz used to call me bo
At six months I told them Million go tops on gar-bo
Country came around hes into clappin
Country left same shit started happening
Like he shot rob for some ends Rob shot Joe for some skins
Cory shot Drew and we was friends
Money turned boys into men
The cycle never changes shit just starts again
Naw nigga aint nuthin changed nigga
Yeah Ive been gone for a minute but Im back
Damn fifty its good to see you back in the hood
You see my cherry-red SL nigga Im doin good
Sometimes I cant find the words to say how I feel
So I take a quote from menace Look at the wheels
Im addicted to stuntin now that Im holdin something
I got a trunk full of guns from VA to unverified
Oh will you let me hold something Nigga you high or something
I dont play games Im bout my money nigga buy something
I got a few fiveths I got a few nines
Here nigga take one
Yeah dont ever say I dont do nothing for you nigga
You know dont say I didnt look out for you know what I mean
But make sure nigga that you go catch some jokes
When you come back you gonna have my paper
For that thang thang know what Im sayin
I dont want it back dont try to use it then give it back to me
Cuz I yall niggaz now runnin around sayin
fifty getting all this rap money and he wont help us ha ha
Sit tight nigga Im comin you know New shit
All the shit I put out on the mix tapes is for the mix tapes

Oh my God my shit is so hot right now Im in the zoneLike the fire needs the air
I wont burn unless your there
Yea I need youI need you to hate
So I can use you for your energy
you know its real shit feel this
Americas got a thing for this gangstas shit they love me
Black Chucks black skullies leather Pelle-Pelle
I take spills over raymo shit Ima fan
Got through the silver duck tape on my trait old handle
The women on my life bring confusion shit
SO like Nino from New Jack Ill have to cancel that bitch
Look at me this is the life I chose
Niggaz around me so cold man my heart dun froze up
I build an empire on the low the narcs dont know
Im the weatherman I take that coco leaf and make that snow
Sit back watch it turn to dope watch it go out the door
O after O you know homey Im just triple beam dreamin
Niggaz be schemin Im fiendin to live a good life
The fiends just fiendin
Conceal my weapon nice and easy so you cant see
The penitentiary is definitely out the question for me
Chorus
I want the finer things in my life
So I hustle hustle
Nigga you get in my way when while Im tryin to get mine
And Ill buck you buck you
I dont care who you run with or where you from
Nigga fuck you fuck you
I want to find the thing thats in my life
So I hustle hustle
Yea I dont know shit about gymnastics I summersault bricks
Black talents start flyin when a nigga flip
I cook crack in the microwave niggaz cant fuck with me
Man my cold days they called me chef boy are fifty
Check my logic smokers dont like seeds in their weed shit
Send me them seeds ill grow em what they need
Them aint chia pet plants in the crib thats chronic
And Im sellin them five hundred a pop god damn it
I sold everythin Ima hustler I know how to grind
Step on grapes put in water and tell you its wine
If you analyze me what youll find is the DNA recrock
What goes in my mind its contagious
Hypnotic it sounds melodic
If the rap was the block or spider Ill be poke and butter
Now get a load of me flashy far from low key
And you can locate me where ever that dope be gettin money man
Chorus
Its a hustlers ambition close your eyes listen see my vision
Mossberg pumpin shotgun dumpin and drama means nothin
Its part of the game catch me in the coupe switchin lanes
In the jewels with your chains
I upgrade from thirty BS to clean VS
Rocks that I copped procedes from the spot
I got the energy to win Im full of adrenaline
Played it perf and get nauseous watchin the spinner spin
I make plans to make it a prisoner of the state
Now I can invite yo ass out to my estate
Them holi tip bent me up but Im back in shape
Pour Crystal in the blender and make a protein shake
Im like the East coast number one playboy B
Hugh Hefnerll tell you he dont got shit on me
The feds watch me icey they cant stop me
Racist pointin at me look at the nigga ratchi
Hello
ChorusVerse one - Nas
Hats off to da rich ones who flash and floss
Pour some liquors out to my dogs trapped up north
Reminisce on the deceased who no longer exist
Only wishin we could bring them back with songs like dis
Old flicks on us chillin wit da old time click
Holdin nines thoughts of death not our lives we risk
How it use to be early morn pumpin in shifts
Jakes wit pale faces in the night is the scariest
They handcuff me they knew my government and alias
Various calls were made up for awarin us
The Ds in the marked vans and cabs
In our land hoodrats get stapped by niggas who forty
Turnin out young ladys and make them make thoughties
Got them coked out the hood is bugged out
Thug babies famous in they strollers
Before they walk they knew the hood talk
Its in the air of New York
So everybodyll pick em up kissin em up
Treatin them like they own in dis hood we call home
Fist fight till we grown and these guns come out
Circle of life its kinda deep how we end out
Chorus
Yo them niggas that wanted beef before
Dont want no beef no mo
Now that they know who I rep with
QB NIGGA
Who I rep with
QB NIGGA repeat
Yall niggas better sober up before yall speak to me dont come at me high
Last rapper that raised his voice to me got japped in da eye
Now if I say Im gone get you Ima get ya
On da strength of da inf from long range I can hit ya
You find out them niggas who wit ya aint even wit ya
After da gem stars split ya you need an MD to stitch ya
Peep how I use words to paint pictures
Peep how I got niggas with bodies askin me for ten cents to got hit ya
Look my name up in the law book Curtis Jackson
Known for creatin action by rapidly clappin
Nigga I stay strapped so much I nickname gats
Got a tech I call Tina a nine I name Nina
Two niggas went to see Allah afta they seen her
This QB shit bout to take me to da next level
Next crib next Benz next bitch next bezel
Its that real
Chorus
Yo aiyyo who da fuck wanna war

Smack your man down you ran off
I was gonna hit him with two I left some for you
I put four QB rugged and raw
I got somethin for these rap cats fish held back gats
Scope wit a beam on it loc put your cream on it
Shine dont scheme on it I make your dream about it
Forever whatever whatever get gully
Shots thru your leather and clothe With your skelly off
Break yall clowns off
Yo hollow tips will flood your jacket I dont give a fuck who you be
Millennium Thug now who da fuck want it with me
I mastered the art of slap boxin niggas in da dark
QBs big man Horse of the Bravehearts
Im da Sasquash of rap collector of gats
Testin macks at your bulletproof vests and hats
How bout that guns bust off I bust back
When trucks backfire I bust back
How bout that stomp a muhfuckin rib out ur back
Yall niggas aint gangsta rap yall click like Josey and the Pussycats
When we come around da front stop
Uh huh yall cant fuck around yall get dropped
When guns pop whos tellin
Twin barrel nines wavin and yellin QB NIGGA WHAT
Two-time felon straight to da melon straight to da dome
Send a nigga back get da shells go straight home
Never slip my Ill Will to survive is so deep
Cant sleep cousin to death makes me weak
Pullin triggers at my shadow Bravehearts pop up
Wiz Jungle and Horse shot your block up
Them niggas that wanted war before
Dont want no war no mo
Now that they know who I rep wit
QB NIGGA
Who I rep wit
QB NIGGA repeatYo Black is flashy like Alpo gun happy like Pappy
Sneaky muthafucka remind me of nigga that crack me
He aint the type you shoot dice with and win dog
Unless you want to get your ass layed out in gilmore
Yes we soldiers remind me Troy and E-Bags
When they came through they hollored like What up Conrad
Grimey niggaz they loved to get gully
Summertime still had on black gloves and scullies
The Lex four hundred and fifty pulled up thats Cornbread
Them niggaz from Philly would of called him an old head
But he an OG remind me of Chaz and Bump real low key
Sounded like he didnt know nothing about drama
For this money shit many men do trauma
Switchy walked in son this bitch had the baddest ass
The bulletproof glass was rolled up on the S-Class
Heard in DC he kept mad blocks in order
Picture this a young nigga gettin it like Rich Porter
Sonny came in for half a pit
He got knocked he on lock still controllin his block from constop
Pop pulled up in the CLfive his project changed
His man just got fucking murked by Salene
Heard he got it in the range nigga Bean popped one in his brain
Over some-thing took his watch and his chain
Country boys off the hook down there and Richmond main
In the black seven hundred and forty I sat hat turned back
Bow down baby nelly singing my wrist blinging What
Im waiting on this nigga Wise we lost for two pies
Son he smokin that shit I can see it in his eyes
Coming up wise emotions closed
Most buying round looking for wisemen toast
Benny hopped out the Esculade with a few thourough men from B-More
They sellin heroin in Maryland reverse back to Diesel
Killed like four fiends his popularity grew that only meant more cream
First it was him and his brother now he got a team
Went from five and a half grams to living the dream
City pulled up Goddamn you know his format
Bentley is all marble in the door and floor match
Got the gats out the stash box popped two glocks
Peace All Eyez on Me twoPac
Everybody know he a boss he gotta floss
He on the same bullshit that sent Gotti up north
Thats Dime in the blue ts stunting like he Nicky Barnes
He broke but he talk like he a Don
Homes hoppin out the Jag thats Max haitian cat
Kill a nigga quick remind me of Haitian Jack
I peep his style son I know his stelo He on the d-low
He smile at niggaz mumbling fuck you in Creole
Heard war stories bout how he maneuver with the Ruger
Hold the iron horizontally and send shots through ya
Few niggaz tried to murk him most them got fount
Some turnt away try to run they in wheelchairs now
Banks hopped out bulletproof this bulletproof that
Bulletproof snorkel bulletproof hat
Got out a Black hummer he blew ninety on that
Poppin mad shit like he gonna bulletproof that lets gofifty Cent
Ah-ha man Ay you know where them niggaz be at right
click-clack Take me to em
All through the hood I keep hearin niggaz sayin
- Im supposed to die tonight
Niggaz done put a hit out and they talkin like the shit okay
- Im down to ride tonight
We rollin whip stolen AK golden
- Im down to ride tonight
Weed smokin straight locn lock and loadin
- Somebody gon die tonight
This is nuttin new I been in this position before
Grandma crib niggaz outside of her door
Different day same shit old mac new clip
thirty-two hollow-tips gloves no rubber grip
Im a boss but niggaz never show no respect
I catch em slippin Ill have em tongue-kissin my tec
Gwan come test me pussy bwoy dont try it
Police response never fast enough to shots fired
Dont be stupid find out who you fuckin with son
Fore we find out where yo bitch get her hair and nails done
Its elementary life is but a dream
You know row row your boat your blood forms a stream
After you get hit you shoulda thought about the shit
You took that paper you take a life or yo life get took bitch
Sometimes I sit and look at life from a different angle
Dont know if Im Gods child or Im Satans angel
Chorus
In two thousand and two if you asked me to make a wish
I simply woulda wished that my music would be a hit
Big said Damn - niggaz wanna stick me for my paper
And pray for my downfall I understand it all
But me Im a little more flashy a nigga
So chances are Ima have to blast me a nigga
Im on that Kevlar and vest shit that wild wild West shit
Theres eighty-one one carat stones in my necklace
I shine so hard I make motherfuckers wan kill me
Every projects in every hood I go they feel me
Know it sounds like rap but this shit is real B
I dont talk that rich shit but nigga Im filthy
When I come out to play and my mob aint with me

Homeboy frontin on mell shorten your lifespan
Hold the mic with my left my knife in my right hand

See Im tired of all these rappin niggas dyin to shine
And Im tired of fiends askin for a dime for nine
Hearing this next punch line from me may sound strange
You sit your five-dollar ass down before I make change
Yo the sale went stale caught em real bad
Fresh out the jail shit is really real
Niggas is still in jail and I pray they dont tell
twenty-man inditement my lawyer gotta fight this
Niggas know I aint never pressed for dough
And niggas know I dont serve nobody I dont know
Son said he was from OT pay eleven an oz
My man brought em to me see he aint really know b
That it was hot dude was a cop
He was just tryin to pop to put the new beams on his drop
First I served him ozs then I served him whole keys
Now we all co-des damn man I OD

Po-Po walking to beat we burnin ls up in the jeep

Chorus

and a figure thatll leave a nigga droolin and shit
There I was kickin my game pickin her brain
buggin cause a while back I met this bitch on the train
she wasnt feelin me I pulled up she wouldnt talk from the whip
Uptown girl she feel like thats some chickenhead shit
but on the sidewalk we aint play games
we exchanged numbers and names
I went back to the Range
I heard her Girlfriend whisperin I know that nigga he rich
she think I got six whips cause me and my Man switch
anyway her name is CeCe
she said she go to BMCC
push a ninety-eight three hundred and twenty-eight with chrome BBs
she said she seen me in the Onyx video on TV
she liked my part the best man this bitch is tryin to G me
Chorus
Its hard as Hell to find a Girl thats really down for ya

Hey Shorty why you like me huh you like the way I spit
oh I hit your girlfriend she told you bout the dick

platinum iced out got rid of that gold shit
I love my lifestyle you too you love it
that I could blow Twenty Thousand and think nothin of it
know you wouldnt fuck with me if I had no ends
probably wouldnt fuck in the whip if it wasnt a Benz
I guess life looks different through them Shanel tints
Man I dont care if these hoes love me or not
long as I rhyme hot Im gettin head in my drop
it goes on and on and on and it dont stop
Chorus
One thing you can always count on is change
and a rich nigga to come put shit in the game
had a forty then Jigga made you trade your Range
wouldve felt broke if you couldnt get your change
now its hard to find us or stay behind us
while we on the nine hundred double R Hondas
watch the cats who flip bricks recline in the latest whips
while Penetentiaries stay packed with cats who sling packs
all these hoes aint Madonna fans but all across the World
you can find a material Girl
I sip Dom till I earl
take em two at a time
quick I get in they mind
have em thinkin they mine
bust off then tell em Bust a Uey on mo time
Im like the reason yall niggas cant eat this year

Yo Shorty tell your friends yall aint fuckin with us
aww man look he aint mean that shit
cmon thats just records niggas is playin
we wasnt serious and shittalking
Uh huh uh huh uh huh
Southside what yall niggas know about the dirty south
One time
Chorus
Lord forgive me for Ive sinned
Over and over again just to stay on top
I recall memories filled with sin
Over and over again and again
Yo when you hear talk of the southside you hear talk of the team
See niggas feared Prince and respected Preme
For all you slow muthafuckas Im a break it down iller
See Preme was a business man and Prince was the killer
Remember he used to push the bulletproof BM uh huh
This here get ya seasick I sat back and peeped shit
The roll with Easy Wider and they aint get blunted
Had the whole projects workin for fifty on five-hundred
As a youth all I ever did was sell crack
I used to idolize cat
Hurt me to my heart to hear that nigga snitched on Pap how he go out like
that
Rumors in the hood was Jes was snitchin
I aint believe that pa he helped me cop my first GSX-R
Had the four-runner the Z the five and the three
Used to drive his truck through the hood draggin jet skis
From Gerald Wallace to Baby Wise dont be suprised
Of how freely I thought of names of guys who dealt with pies
Like LA and Wise L got shot in the neck then told his connect
Them niggas who shot em got em for ten bricks
Fuckin Dominicans turned around and gave em more bricks
Chorus
That first verse is just a dose of the shit that Im on
Consider this the first chapter in the ghettos Quran
I know a lot of niggas that get dough like Bimmy and Joe
And Prince and Rightous from Hillside with the mole on his nose
Throughout my struggles through the hood I started learnin
Lifes a bitch with a pretty face but she burnin
Man Im a get cheese like Chaz then run through whips like Cigar
Gamble all the time like country-curly head Prince and Tata
Po-po under pressure too they know what they facin
Go against crews like B-Bo and killers like Pappy Mason
A lotta niggas I know been corrupted since birth
Enticed to rob nuns for fun for everything they worth
I know some cats that hail at old complexes like Cooley Wall
Together niggas stand and divided they fall
Round here shook niggas they keep it in motion
Come around here with your rollie you can get robbed like Ocean
Lord knows Tommy had loved and sold
Helicopters Rolls Royces with Louie Vuitton interior
Might sound like Im fantasizin but son Im dead serious
Montanna was no dummy brought Benice to wash the money
Had money out the ass he politic like the Asian
FEDs couldnt catch him dirty so settled for tax evasion
Chorus
Yo rest in peace to Rich and Ron money what they was about yo
The twins was from queens but got crazy cream with Alpo
Throughout my time I heard tales of Himey Frenchy Jamaican Pauly Ducky
Cally
Rodney Bump and Chick shit
A lot a niggas flow the way I flow
but aint been in the game all their life so dont know who I know
Writin rhymes is the best way I express how I feel
If I aint rich by twenty-six Ill be dead or in jail
Comin up I heard sippin to much boozell leave you confused
And if you watch the news you see playas in this game that lose
Im forgettin Lefty and Jazz Pretty Tony and Lance
Head Lou Mel son Troy and E Money Bags
And a conversation over shrimp and lobster
And Benny Hiners heard Chico stopped boxin and started robbin diners
Shout out to Clanvis and Clutch Bob Dre Black Will
If the flow dont kill you the Mac will
Chorusfifty Cent and Eminem
Yeah Shady
Haha Wooo
fifty Cent GgGgG G Unit
Haha Here we go again
Yeah Uh huh Haha
fifty Cent
Does it make you mad when I switch my flow
You cant understand how I get my dough
fifty Cent Im on fire cause shady said so Im On Fire
Eminem
Here we go now
Everybodies in a rush to try to get the throne
I just get on the track and try to set the tone
Aint trying to use nobody as a steppin stone
But dont compare me Im better off just left alone
And I aint even tryin to go there with record sales
Im just tryin to keep it humble and respect myself
Say what what up keep steppin and just rep Dtwelve
Keep my nose clean stay away from weapons jail
And livin wreckless but if you would check my belt
You may see soemthing else I use to protect myself
A vest to stop a ruger and deflect the shells and
Send em back at you faster than they left the barrel
And I dont even carry guns no more I dont got to
Got under cover cops thatll legally pop you
And I done seen a lot of people crossed the line
But this motherfucker Ja mustve lost his mind
That X has got him thinkin that he was DMX
Then he switched to Pac now his tryin to be him next
So which one are you X Luther Pac or Michael
Just keep singing the same song recycled
Wed all much rather get along than fight you
Me and hailey dance to your songs we like you
And you dont really want to step inside on my group
Come on now you know the white boy will bite you
Ill hurt your pride dog and you know I dont like to
But I will if I have to
With syllable after syllable ill just slap ya
Killin you faster
Than you poppin pill after little pill of them tabs of
That shit you on but if you want it you got it
Youd bump this shit too if we didnt diss you on it
But if we lock horns we can charge harder than Busta
We bump heads with any motherfucker that wants ta
So whats the deal where was all of the tough talk
When I walked up to ya like Ja what up dog
How come you didnt say you had a problem then
When you was standin there with all you men
We couldve solved it then Im a grown man dogg come holla
All you did was slap hands smile and swallow
Another one of them lil x pills in front of me
And tell me fifty Cent was everything you want to be Cmon
I know you dont want it with me
You know you dont want it with me
You can talk Im still the mc
You dont want to bump heads with me
You couldnt slug me if my father helped you
My punchlines is hot my bars would melt you
Ja you stuart little shells will lift you
Every other week Im buyin a new pistol
I clap at yo ass with this chrome thirty-eight
And put six through yo hat so seven in three eights
Erv you aint shug knight you shook light
I put my knife in ya wind pipe
Then freeze on this turn pike
You know and I know who took ya chain
You got rolled two times so your ass is lame
Im down to die for this shit all I need is bail
You better stick to the movies with segal
Yo fuck that Im tired of these -
Industry niggas unknown you get out of hand
Im gone find you whereabouts unknown
We kill in new york even in Compton they understand
Im on the block where you was raised unknown
They see me poppin more ice because I could unknown
You probably forgot your way around the hood good
Least when your paranoid its hard to make a song
How you want it with us and laugh unknown got make up on
Every magazine I open you on your knees takin prayer pictures
And you aint even got shot yet you scared bitches
You dont know nothin bout what pain is sucker
I put put your ass in the ground like a train conductor motherfucker

Scream murder I dont believe you
Murder Fuck around and leave you

Or niggas in the mess hall gettin shot on shallow lines
An old timer schooled me dont burn bridges my friend
Imagine the G-Dub close and yo ass gotta swim
I watch the fifth melt a nigga melt a nigga of the sidewalk of New York
Me and shorty saw from afar and had a talk
He said I told em if he came around Id clap him I gave him my word
Look at his head its still shakin he had alot of nerve
If it wasnt for the flow
Id probably have to double Back bubble crack

If it wasnt for the flow
Id probably have to double Back bubble crack
yea yea Im a hustler
If it wasnt for the flow
Id probably have to double Back bubble crack
yea yea Im a hustler
Yo when the fed come in the game loyalty is limited
Hardcore niggas start actin feminine
With the feds you do eighty five percent of your time
Duke you get ten youll damn near do nine
Hate a liar more than I hate thief
A thief is only after my salary a liar is after my reality
The streets I knowem like my ABCs
Stay away from the Ds and stack ya cheese
Try to see three hundred gs fore you see three hundred Cs
Tree top to feel the breeze co connect for keys
Yo bitches sexin me take me to ecstacy
Once I nut ahh oh shit I dont want em next to me
If its on mother fucker believe Im gonna ride
Im the type to swallow my blood fore I swallow my pride
Letters on my shirt read DKNY
Got grimy niggas runnin with me from BKNY
If it wasnt for the flow
Id probably have to double Back bubble crack
yea yea Im a hustler
They say I dont sound like a killer well how a killer sound
I bet I grab a foe pound and back that ass down
See many men live baby and many men die
Many men get drunk puff lah and stay high
Heres a jewel love you enemies and hate your friends
Your enemies remain the same friends always change
I dont quit that theres more that one way to skin a cat
You can get him in the face dog or down his back
All bullshit aside now its time to be honest
I fear no man for death is all thats promised
I got niggas standin in line waitin to hear me spit
From eighty six to ninety six the game went from sugar to shit
This for you niggas in the background dyin to shine
I hate you like fiends who ask for a dime for nine
Dont nothin change in the game but faces and names
Skate to wait to date and the jake
If it wasnt for the flow
Id probably have to double Back bubble crack
yea yea Im a hustlerUh huh uh huh uh huh South side

Enticed to rob nuns for fun for everything they worth
I know some cats that hail at old complexes like Cooley Wall
Together niggas stand and divided they fall
Round here shook niggas they keep it in motion
Come around here with your rollie you can get robbed like Ocean
Lord knows Tommy had loved and sold
Helicopters Rolls Royces with Louie VaTonne interior
Might sound like Im fantasizin but son Im dead serious
Montanna was no dummy brought Benice to watch the money
Had money out the ass he politic like the Asian
Feds couldnt catch him dirty so settled for tax evasion
Lord forgive me for Ive sinned
Over and over again just to stay on top
I recall memories filled with sin
Over and over again and again
Yo rest in peace to Rich and Ron money what they was about yo
The twins was some queens but got crazy cream with Alpo
Throughout my time I heard tales of Himey
Frenchy Jamaican Pauly Ducky Cally
Rodney Bump and Chick shit a lot a niggas flow the way I flow
But aint been in the game all their life so dont know who I know
Writin rhymes is the best way I express how I feel
If I aint rich by twenty-six Ill be dead or in jail
Comin up I heard sippin too much boozell leave you confused
And if you watch the news you see playas in this game that lose
Im forgettin Lefty and Jazz Pretty Tony and Lance
Head Lou Mel son Troy and E Money Bags
And a conversation over shrimp and lobster
And Benny Hiners heard Chico stopped boxin
And started robbin diners shout out to Clanvis and Clutch
Bob Dre Black Will if the flow dont kill you the Mac will
Lord forgive me for Ive sinned
Over and over again just to stay on top
I recall memories filled with sin
Over and over again and againMadd Rapper

Jim Star crush your head give your ass a shape-up
Uptown niggas known for the money they make
Everybody aint shook you see doing the shake
The boss spending ends
Saying Gimme that Benz twenty inch rims and four TVs
The snitch in the precinct saying
He sell X he sell techs and he sell D
The balla by the bar saying
Everybody drink the best champagne its all on me
Snitch in the back of the police car
Pointing out the window saying He robbed me
Its elementary

Lloyd Banks in the house
Now get the fuck on the floor I slid through the front door
With the nine and the velor a cal in my pocket
You will Ima pop it Im down for a profit
Im ghetto as hell you cant you tell
My road dog under the jail getting frustrating mail
So Im drinking and smoking thinking and hoping
This cell gon open you can dance next to me
But dont throw an elbow Ill throw one back
And leave blood on your Shell Toes
Hell no I aint paying for pleasure
Your pussy dont bring rainbows and pots of treasure
Its every girls dream to floss with the team
Long on the suine DVDs on the screen
Blowing on cream waiting for you to scheme
You aint gotta know how to read to spray a magazine
The boss spending ends
Saying Gimme that Benz twenty inch rims and four TVs
The snitch in the precinct saying
He sell X he sell techs and he sell D
The balla by the bar saying
Everybody drink the best champagne its all on me
Snitch in the back of the police car
Pointing out the window saying He robbed me

When I use them big words your bitch be feeling me
So yall niggas hate me cause your wives be our groupies
Yall irritate me like loud people in the movies
Fall back matter fact back down
Cause I just passed security without no pat down
You can catch me in the bathroom blowing a sticky
Or catch me on the dance floor feeling some tits
Sex sells so Ima P I M P
So my pockets never be empty
It aint no problem we scoop them models
We got condoms coups and lavish condos
fifty got me getting ass like I never did
So when I step in the club hoes love the kid
The boss spending ends
Saying Gimme that Benz twenty inch rims and four TVs
The snitch in the precinct saying
He sell X he sell techs and he sell D

My opinion of a sweet dream is a dead NARC

When it comes to bad bitches you know I got them
Some from Long Beach some from some from Compton
You know a nigga wanna see how Cali girls freak off
After that five hour flight from New York
I start spitting G at a bitch like a pimp man
Tell her meet me at the so we can do our thing
She can bring the lingerie with her I suppose
And we can go from fully dressed to just having no clothes
She can run and tell her best friend bout my sex game
Her best friend could potentially be next man
Listen man shit changed

Holdin nines thoughts of death not our lives we risk
How it use to be early morn pumpin in shifts
Jakes wit pale faces in the night is the scariest
They handcuff me they knew my government and alias
Various calls were made up for awarin us
The Ds in the marked vans and cabs
In our land hoodrats get stapped by niggas who forty
Turnin out young ladys and make them make thoughties
Got them coked out the hood is bugged out
Thug babies famous in they strollers
Before they walk they knew the hood talk
Its in the air of New York
So everybodyll pick em up kissin em up
Treatin them like they own in dis hood we call home
Fist fight till we grown and these guns come out
Circle of life its kinda deep how we end out

She aint even have to run to get away with the bread
Thats some fucked up shit
Think about that kid
Im thinking what this bitch thinking when she take me to court
I pay my child support what the fuck she want
This relationship shit its too much for me
I wanna fuck your friends and live comfortably
She wanna shine and blow minds on shopping sprees
She should have what she wants just not for me
Im thinking bout my future she part of my past
She dont care bout me she just want some cash
Im thinking damn girl we used to be friends
How did sh-t become all about ends
Chorus
Do you think about me

Sing-sing is where he biddin
She in the Gucci tights and Findi high heals
Baby wipes and cans of Infamil
Moter bike and grams of fish scale

And all the prank calls was death threats that bitch had the best sex
All across the globe and the bitch head game was out of control
Girl you know I like it when you climb on top
Love muscles feel tighter than a headlock

And my down bitch as a holster like Im supposed to
Heavy pistol sales for living
My gun rip through lungs and tear through tissue
While Im out for the ends you out for a rep
Thats the same thing that have yo mama in a black dress
See me in a black lex hard-top
My mink drop-top fresh out the carlot
I got the gift of raw pugilist speeches
So Im goin sell like the box office features
Niggas in the hood cant see G-UNIT
But deep in they heart they want to be G-UNIT
Cause we got them three Bs benzes burners and bitches
And plus we on the road to the riches
You can say what you want about me
As long as you dont get in the way of my money
Cause all that talking shit to me played out
Nigga keep bumping your gums you get laid out
Lloyd Banks
Lately I been going through a phase
Hope they aint tap the phones
Cause we got pumps the size of saxophones
Therefore Im on the move with the squad
Im stingy as ever known to trick fast food on a broad
Picture me putting jewels on a broad
Id rather put shoes on the car
A pool in the yard
You dont really want to fool with the god
Nigga my front line long enough to fill two boulevards
In this game you only make it far if you loyal
And if you grew up with your mother and your father you spoiled
Why swing you gotta be strapped to get rid of me
Ill leave you in water like the statute of liberty
Tryin to be cool
Blowin green that strong enough to make a white boy open fire on a school
Keep rappin for your hood Im rappin for Benzes
And long assault rifles with straps on the lenses

And them out of town niggas Im chargin whyall more

Gimme his watch and his chain

Crap table in Vegas had his bitch on my dick

Chorus
One thing you can always count on is change

I rap a muthafucking house around my my wrist for wreck
While you niggas race neck to neck
While niggas who live from cheque to tech
I aint even going to front I aint working with a full deck
Life in the hood so hard I done lost some of my cards
Instead of praying before I sleep I put my hands on my heat
As soon as I start dreaming Im right back on the street
Any nigga in this game flowing they think they can see me

My back on the wall now you gon see
Better watch how you talk when you talk about me
Cause Ill come and take your life away
Many men many many many many men
Wish death pon me
Lord I dont cry no more
Dont look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me
Now these pussy niggas putting money on my head
Go on and get your refund motherfucker I aint dead
Im the diamond in the dirt that aint been found
Im the underground king and I aint been crowned
When I rhyme something special happen every time
Im the greatest something like Ali in his prime
I walk the block with the bundles
Ive been knocked on the humble
Swing the ox when I rumble
Show your ass what my gun do
Got a temper nigga go head lose your head
Turn your back on me get clapped and lose your legs
I walk around gun on waist chip on my shoulder
Till I bust a clip in your face pussy this beef aint over
Many men many many many many men
Wish death pon me
Lord I dont cry no more
Dont look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me
Have mercy on my soul
Somewhere my heart turned cold
Have mercy on many men
Many many many many men
Wish death upon me
Sunny days wouldnt be special if it wasnt for rain
Joy wouldnt feel so good if it wasnt for pain
Death gotta be easy cause life is hard
Itll leave you physically mentally and emotionally scarred
This if for my niggas on the block twisting trees and cigars
For the niggas on lock doing life behind bars
I dont see only god can judge me cause I see things clear
Quick these crackers will give my black ass a hundred years
Im like Paulie in Goodfellas you can call me the Don
Like Malcolm by any means with my gun in my palm
Slim switched sides on me let niggas ride on me
I thought we was cool why you want me to die homie
Many men many many many many men
Wish death pon me
Lord I dont cry no more
Dont look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me
Have mercy on my soul
Somewhere my heart turned cold
Have mercy on many men
Many many many many men
Wish death upon me
Every night I talk to god but he dont say nothing back
I know he protecting me but I still stay with my gat
In my nightmares niggas keep pulling techs on me
Psych says some bitch dumb put a hex on me
The feds didnt know much when Pac got shot
I got a kite from the pens that told me Tuck got knocked
I aint gonna spell it out for you motherfuckers all the time
Are you illiterate nigga You cant read between the lines
In the bible it says what goes around comes around
Almost shot me three weeks later he got shot down
Now its clear that Im here for a real reason
Cause he got hit like I got hit but he aint fucking breathing
Many men many many many many men
Wish death pon me
Lord I dont cry no more
Dont look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me
Have mercy on my soul
Somewhere my heart turned cold
Have mercy on many men
Many many many many men
Wish death upon meIm on parole I used to be on probation
Im with my gun I get full corporation
I tell you take it off no hesitation
Nigga you play around I lay you down
Thats how its goin down
Dont play wit me I dont have patients
My headachin and I need my medication
Niggas be hatin they dont know what they facin
Nigga you play around I lay you down

Nigga witness against me Im a erase em
If they try an runaway Im a chase em
Now with the pound and Im a lay em down

Chorus
Better watch how you talk
Better watch where you walk
On the streets of New York
Thats how we get down
twenty-twos on the jeep
Somethin deep in the seat
When we creep wit the heat
Thats how we get down
Wise men listen and laugh while fools talk
Stick up kids dont live long in New York
Fuck around and catch the wrong jukes on the street
Get caught slippin then get hit wit like three

And if Im focused while Im strokin I could change how you walk
Theres a swagger that you calm but when you come from New York

Separate me from the rest I feel like Im the best
If theres a price to pay for feelin you I pay that twice

After three summers in the joint I thought life was hard
Some niggas started fightin some niggas found God
You know me started sellin leek in the yard
Yo I ran into niggas who used to have Hummers big as Hell
In the joint wearin eighty-six numbers damn Dog you been in here that long
You could think that but say that and yo ass is dead wrong
A convoy is only three words Yo whattup
You aint gotta work out to leave this bitch cut up
Let a nigga find out you on some goin home shit
And you tryin to bounce without payin a loan shit
Some niggas beat cases on the strength of they cream
After the witnesses disappeared on the strength of they team
Im hard as Hell to get along wit so it never fails
A nigga I got beef with end up in the same jail
He had a L rolled in bible paper blowin the lye
I sent him a little kite just to be blowin his high
And when I shot you in New York why would I box you now
If I catch you in the yard Ima ox you down
Niggas you think is real really cant hold they own
Ill have em on some ET shit tryin to phone home
In here a gem star is like a Nine Milly chrome
Its similar in fact theyll both split ya dome
Scars are souvenirs niggas always take em home
You got blown over the jack
That aint gangsta
Your Man ran when you got clapped
That aint gangsta
Rockin a vest with no gat
That aint gangsta
You only a thug when you rap
That aint gangsta
Niggas jocked you for your track
That aint gangsta
You ran to other thugs to get it back
That aint gangsta
Niggas ran off with your packs
That aint gangsta
If you aint bustin ya gat
That aint gangsta
Youd call me an Animal if you seen me livin on lock
I stay in a box cats be shook when Im visitin pop-ulation
When I walk by niggas like Fifty dont play Son
Yeah somethin really wrong with that nigga

Nigga yous front you gon get shot down

Nigga aint nuttin change you move Ill blow your brains
These niggaz dont really want war
They just walk around frontin cause I walk around stuntin
Why you think the long pump is in the trunk for
If you really want somethin we can show up at your front door
I know my history my family tree dont said Master
Fuck livin positive cause negativity spreads faster
A celebrity has ta bulletproof his car
Cause big hits come flyin through ya door like Casper
Im smokin out the jar scopin out the bar
Distracted see shorty breast pokin out the bra
Not the type to go spark metal in
Start thinkin you gangsta cause you hit a park yellow van
Act hard but ya heart made a marshmallows man
Talk tough til you get cuffed and start tellin damn
Everyday I got a new bitch and when Im done wit her
Itll look like she dived head first in the pool wit it
You only gon wind up dead tryin to prove shit
I put chalk around ya head like a pool stick
I gotta have bucks on the waist
Im hungry like a South African with fly stuck to his face
Catch Banks in a truck full of bass
Remember Im a bachelor the four or five ducks outta space
You could either get bucked or get ya ass jumped
The only trigger you can touch is on a gas pump
I got my own personal slave she really got a curfew
Cook and clean for the kid like silly in color purple
I know you wanna pop me but if I hit you first
The exit wound gon be the size of a hockey puck
Fuck I really hold the rubber
I send sparks at you and I dont mean Emilio or Bubba
Im aimin for a video cover huge tall bustas
A pound and a philly hold the smuggler
G-Units whats up right now
The Gucci cloth is on a Newport sign upside down
You gotta come a little harder nigga
You wear jerseys while mine a throwback and yours is a Starter
You still gotta beg a hoe
And you mad cause you blowin on oregano
You niggazll never blow anyone to step in my ring is brave
I dont know a thing about hair stylin but I can make a finger weave
Short stay leave her butt in the telly
Lace up the beef and broccolis peanut butter and jelly
Im about to get this deal shorty know
Thats why she foamin out the grill like a Alka-Seltzer pill
I aint loud around a snitch
I dont crowd around a bitch
The jumpsuit match wit the Carolina kicks
I been sick since niggaz was on Harlod Miner dick
I could call up a chick and put a child around her lips
Niggaz cant stand the fact that Im real
I kidnap the queen from the castle and put her back on the pill
Gimme Barbie at her best Bacardi at the chest
Im similar to the young Marcus Darvy at the desk
Useta have ta push up now I hardly got to press
Got two gun and both lead to cardiac arrest
My success got suckers salty blowin steam like a cup of coffee
Click POW get these fuckas off me
I hear a lotta talkin niggaz must be mad at Banks

And they dont know who hit him
The hood talkin man everybody know
I know its fucked up
Now I lay thee down to sleep
Niggas tryin to lay me down with heat
If I should die do before I awake
I pray my Lord my soul to take
If dead men could talk in your sleep
And your homie told you who got him
Would you have the heart to shoot the nigga that shot him
Or would you start switchin up
You think about the penitentiary your bitchin up
What if he said money aint everything
The hood raised us wrong
What it takes to get your money long
But look Im gone
Would that touch your heart have you feelin funny inside
Would that be enough to make your punk ass ride
What if he gave you a lil list of things to do
Said he wouldnt have to die he could live through you
Would you load your gats and get ready ro ride
Or would you lock the door at your crib and hide
Its a cold world even when its hot outside
Whether sunshine or rain you still feel pain
Hit him cause he was your strength
Now you in a daze
Your homie turnin over in his grave
Cause you pussy
Ya know who killed him
Ya know who killed him
Ya know who killed him
Ride
Ya know who killed him
Ya know who killed him
Ya know who killed him
Ride
Them boys smoked your homie
You aint gon do nothin back
Not even if he told you you next to get clapped
It dont take much for them shells to make the best of you
Your peoples probably gon cremate and burn the rest of you
You done did too much dirt to try and make it to heaven
Nigga is you down for this one eight seven
When you reach the pearly gates how you gon explain
You gonna try and tell God youve been framed
Yall did everything together he was your dog
Now you uptown coppin and he in the morgue
Them niggas he gave pacs to they kept the cake
His sister and baby momma talkin to Jake
Da niggas that rocked him they came to the wake
But they come inside they sat out in the ride
At the funeral homicide all in the business
Walkin round askin niggas to tell em who did it
Niggas is throwin blows now you ready to rumble
Thirsty niggas an animal the hood is a jungle
Broke nigga will body someone over a bundle
Man a three year old kid in my hood know what a gun do
Ya know who killed him
Ya know who killed him
Ya know who killed him
Ride
Ya know who killed him
Ya know who killed him
Ya know who killed him
Ride

Ya know who killed him
Ya know who killed him

Governor G-G-G-G-G-Unit
She aint that chick from the burbs thats a stranger to drama
She that Uptown Girl with the cock at the sauna
Went out her way to let her know that I want her
I told her I - know fo sho we belong together
And I wouldnt break her heart my intentions are better
And I shared the same dreams she had about cheddar
When the Ds came she was down to hold the Beretta
I got a thing for baby girls me and her against the world
Governor - singing
We used to think the same schemes with the same dreams in mind
tenll bring you back twenty if the crook is on time
And she knows daddy loves to eat
Take a seat and let my baby rub my feet
She was a clear thinker with a plan to rule the world
But understandin her place is my girl
Talk about hardcore to win shed give her life
Or shoot to kill to protect this life
The world will hear whats really goin on in my life - my life
The world will see what was really down down in my life - my life
If you only knew the pain I feel if you only could feel the streets is real
If they only knewwwwww whats goin onnnnnnn yeah
fifty Cent
Youre sunshine your smile make my day
Its simple - your dimple your eyes
Your lips your thighs got me hypnotized
Communications deep I love it when we talk
Hate it when you leave but when you leave I love to watch you walk
You make a nigga forget about a life full of drama
She got expensive taste she get it from her momma
Materialistic still a nigga want her
Consistently missin her touch when she gone uhh
She smell like Chanel she feelin me and I can tell
With the right woman by my side I feel like I cant fail
Ive been around been up and down my attitude is fuckin ass
She a rider Im in heaven when Im inside her
Workin up a sweat kissin on her neck twelve Play in the deck
Foplay correct have her drippin wet
She looked in my eyes and say she like it but I know she love it
I just keep doin what Im doin and think nuttin of it
abruptly ends halfway during the last line of the Chorus
STOPnonstop

She kiss it she suck it
She want me to want it

She want to climb up on it

Mmm yeah uhh
Mind playing tricks on me man
Its a regular day and a regular routine
Til I hear this tragic news from about two fiends
Your man fifty just got popped nine times
And I heard through the grapevines its all cause he rhymes
In front of his grandma Im standin on the lawn
Wearin no Teflon I wonder if he gone
I know in my heart I wanna cry
Havin thoughts in my mind is my man gon die
As I frantically run towards fifty spot
I panicky peep like fifty cops
It was blue whites DTs and homicide
With yellow tape locked off on both sides
With four-fifth shells on the floor
And DTs ringin doorbells goin door to door
Yo Im stressed out smokin bogie after bogie
Duckin the sarge cause the sarge fuckin know me
I jumped in Jeep truck and got a mac to spit
And we did about a buck cause Mary Mack I lit
at the time I started thinkin back some shit
How we used to sling crack and stack our chips
With Kev P-Low Big Jewel the Kid
And my man fifty used to smack a bitch
And the good and the bad on the one-three-four
And them hoes that we had on the Cash Money tour
Now Im at the hospital stop daydreamin
All I see is five-five-one and theres beefin
Baby moms is screamin whole family grievin
But the word is that my mans still breathin
I dropped to my knees and I thanked the Lord

Those that plot on me nine times outta ten the nine is on me
Feds search the god but nothin they find on me
When I rap dont wait to clap applaud sooner
Unless you hate a nigga like George Bush Jr I bring awkward to you
Porsche maneuvers through the city like new york sewers
Stinkin up the air central park horse manure
Rims is twenty-two inches Benz suspensions

Impotent you niggas get me sick wanna be soundin like

ChorusThis is how Im feeling right now I mean Im blessed
Me I aint got around doctor required
But nigger Im cleaner than your motherfucking preacher on Sunday morning
Me I run the streets so hard to get by
But better be the cleanest motherfucker in the surfs on Sunday morning
I made so many mistakes so many corrections Im so far from perfect so many imperfections
But Im a go gettaI get up and go get it so if youre preaching prosperity I wanna hate it
I make the hood look good turn base into base lines
punchlines to white lines and run for them one time
My verse is like a graphic scene close your eyes man you seen it dont feel
And you seen puff glow like theres no tomorrow
Hit that pass that thats the motto you know bills like they releasing from my friends
They gonna wake up tomorrow with the same shit again
You think Im bad man they dont give a fuck
Theyre trying to do what they gotta do to get it from
Me I aint got around doctor required
But nigger Im cleaner than your motherfucking preacher on Sunday morning
Me I run the streets so hard to get by
But better be the cleanest motherfucker in the surfs on Sunday morning
I take a line out the cookbook shoot me I shoot back I dont care if you die
First the sun comes down then the sun goes up
And the coke price too when the niggas make a buzz
Its freeze nigger get the fuck on the wall
Anything you work for they come and take it all
Man its like they dont know what theyre taking
Hit you with the tazer then you siting like a victim
When you pray say a prayer for me a nigger could use it
Before we pop up on that ass with toasters
Lord forgive me Im the rest of the game
Forgive me for that line and the rest of my sinsIf you think youre lonely now
Wait until tonight girl
Ah man
If you think youre lonely now
Wait until tonight girl
Im waitin on you to come baby Im that man
Bedroom superhero naked Im Batman
I kill it then I give ya mouth-to-mouth CPR
Bring ya back to life climax start your after life
Bounce up and down on my love this is chronic
Have it how you want it my back shots bionic
She givin me something I can feel like En Vogue
Unload then reload recharge Im back on
Back at it fuckin up the sprigs in her Craftmatic
Jack rabbit addiction I dont wanna break that habit
Your boy toy man child its cool you can play with me
City life bright lights tonight you can stay with me
I wanna share thoughts lets talk go for a walk
Fantasies we can get loose right in the park
Bullseye right through her head to her heart
Its mental and physical when youre gone Ill be missin you
You gon get it you gon get it
I got a plan for you Got it all planned girl
Girl its on til the mon when you come through ha ha
I cant think of a thing that I wont do What you wan do

Im Curtis Mayfield Marvin the new Bobby Womack
two thousand and twelve freak shit baby Im all that
The touchin and the teasin the pleasures the reason
Im sure shell be open from the lickin and strokin
Or how I say a line and it stimulates her mind
My sense of humor I make her smile while passin time
Its sexual its not perverted or obscene
The foreplay we play until I touch her til she cream
Cash rules the shortie shes something out a dream
Half J-Lo half Jessica Biel she in between
Got that island girl swag she Dutty Wine
When we get back to the spot that ass is mine
See how I switch gears her bra gone its on
Its showtime its my turn to perform
Leave the lights on while I get it I got it good
She sayin she love my show Im sayin I knew she wouldIntro

This time its gon take a whole SWAT team to bring me in
Im back on this shit again

Or how I say a line and it stimulates her mind
My sense of humor I make her smile while passin time
Its sexual its not perverted or obscene
The foreplay we play until I touch her til she cream
Cash rules the shortie shes something out a dream
Half J-Lo half Jessica Biel she in between
Got that island girl swag she Dutty Wine
When we get back to the spot that ass is mine
See how I switch gears her bra gone its on
Its showtime its my turn to perform
Leave the lights on while I get it I got it good
She sayin she love my show Im sayin I knew she wouldChorus

Ask Nas Kelis was the illest Ether

She aint even have to run to get away with the bread
Thats some fucked up shit
Think about that kid
Im thinking what this bitch thinking when she take me to court
I pay my child support what the fuck she want
This relationship shit its too much for me
I wanna fuck your friends and live comfortably
She wanna shine and blow minds on shopping sprees
She should have what she wants just not for me
Im thinking bout my future she part of my past
She dont care bout me she just want some cash
Im thinking damn girl we used to be friends
How did sh-t become all about ends

My knife flip open and then I gets to poking
Youre not really really ready
Them shells start popping and bodies get to dropping
Youre not really really ready
You think ya ready ya not
Really really readyThe rap game hip-hop one hundred and one
The hardest nine to five youll ever have
You cant remember shit in no history book
You ready to rap motherfucker
You ready to sell your soul hahaha
The rap game will fuck you up
Ima disrupted nigga you made me crazy
You shoulda slayed me as a baby
Behavin shadier than Wes Craven
And you aint even gotta pay me
I take pleasure of layin a nigga down daily
You face me punk its over youll faint fast
Ive never fucked up to where I cant whoop ya ass
Youll neckll get snapped with bare hands fuck music
Is he rappin Its cool but fools just dont confuse it
What happens these dudes get rude then I lose it
Im scandalous I blow ya two niggas off the atlas
With a gat thats bigger than Godzillas back nigga
You are not realer in fact youre feel the effects
Of a crack dealer whyall presidents since we smacked
And got a mack ten with it so I aint gotta rap
But Im thankful for that dont mistakin me black
Cause youll be stankin in the back of a fuckin Cadillac
Ima get snuffed cause I aint said enough to pipe down
I pipe down when the White House just wiped out
When I see that little Cheney dike get sniped out
Lights out bitch adios goodnight gunshot AHH
Now put that in ya little pipe and bite down
Think for a minute cause the hype just died down
That I wont go up in the Oval Office right now
And flip whatever aint tied down upside down
Im all for America fuck the government
Tell that seed to Laura tell the slut to suck a dick
Motherfuck ducked what the fuck son of a bitch
Take away my gun Im gonna tuck some other shit
Cant tell me shit about the tricks of this trade
Switchblade with a little switch to switch blades
And switch from a six to a sixteen inch blade
Shits like a samurai sword of Cincy
Shit just dont change to this day
Im this way still tell that utslay ipsbay
Upsay my ipnay scuse my ickpay addelay
But uckfay the rap game
Chorus
This rap game this rap game
I aint sellin my soul for this rap game
And I aint diggin no hole for this rap game
Man Im tellin you know it aint happening
This rap game this rap game
I aint sellin my soul for this rap game
I aint diggin no hole for this rap game
This rap game this rap game
I wouldnt want to be drinkin drowned in my own inequity
But fucked that Ima rap til whyall all get sick of me
And clutch my nuts sack and spit all who pick at me
Im pickin a rott mix fuck the dogs you sic on me
Im sayin you motherfuckers dont know us quit playin
If Im broke then Im breakin up in the place where you layin
You know same shit every nigga done in his life
I lived to this wise speak on when I want when I write
So why should I ever fear another man
If he bleed like I bleed take a piss and he stand
OK you win you can say we cant rap
But no shorts cause Im mean say this is whack
I walk in that party and just start bussin gunshots and screaming
Right after I hear the last verse of Self Destruction
This liquor makes me want to blast the chrome
To let you know the time without Morris Dangerome nigga
Im low down and shifty quickly call Swifty
To do a drive-by on the tenth speed with fifty
Ya feelin lucky Squeeze
I catch you outside of Chuckie Cheese
With ya seed you be an unlucky G
My lifestyle is unstable I party anatic
They said no fightin in the club so I brought me a matic
Coughin the static I jump niggas call me a rabbit
Poppin the tablet and guns to soften
Chorus
I snatch the chalk from the sidewalk and piss on the curb
This is absurd we street niggas twistin the words
We finally could Say Goodbye to Hollywood
cause Proof and Shyne man shit nothin in common
But ask this band with gasoline chan
We never bow down to be a flash in the pan
No remorse fuck ya stature dog
Nothin to do with hands when I clap at whyall
But to draw on the ground with the form and the pound
Then Im gone outta town fore the law come around
So we can battle with raps we can battle with gats
Matter of fact we can battle for plaques This rap game
Im too fuckin retarded
I dont give a fuck about my dick
Thats why Im datin Lorraina Bobbet
My crew had an argument who was the largest
Now they all is dead and I roll as a solo artist
Plus I made all the beats and wrote all the raps
Well I really didnt but I did accordin to this contract
I was thrown in the snow with nowhere to go
Freezin twenty below forced to join
My little girl she shouldnt listen to these lyrics
Thats why I glued her headphones to her ear to make sure she hear it
If rap dont work Im startin a group with Garth Brooks
Hahahaha and just say Look
ChorusTo all my fans above fifty Cent
Happy Valentines Dayfifty Cent
It aint good to good in front of niggas in the hood right

You can catch me in public housing wit bundles of D
Or in the Santa Monica mountains bundled up to ski
Since time is money I rhyme on the clock
And walk through the strip with a nine in the ox
You seen the ice you know its top notch
And when it comes to dice Im seeing shorty to the shot box
Banks stop guns pop through your tank top
And leave you wet up like a sonar range drop
When I grind I wear the same thing tomorrow
When you grind its Showtime at the Apollo
Damn near every rapper gotta hide sixteen
Well my flows like a ho thats sixteen
I ran through niggas dismantled niggas
They mad cause they see me in Cancun bitches
But Im ghetto straight from the hood my nigga
If theres no toothbrush Ima use my finger
I got so many minks and so many leathers
The crib is surrounded by animal protesters
Im a grown man still livin like Im young
With the mind of an old man full of wisdom
Here the cops come task force van
Rock so much ice Im called Jack Frost man
And while we sippin on cris you sippin backwash man
Your team got heart but your hearts in my hand
You want sixteen bars in song format
Or sixteen cars on your moms doormat whatGo go go go go go go shawty

From the last shootout I got a demple on my face

Shell hit my jaw I aint wait for doctor to get it out
Hit my wisdom tooth huck-too spit it out
I dont smile a lot cause aint nothin pretty
Got a purple heart for war and I aint never left the City
Hos be like Fitty you so witty

If you get shot and run to the cop - You not like me
You aint got no work on the block - You not like me
Its hot you aint got no drop - You not like me
Like me duke you not like me
Verse
Moma said
Everything that happened to us was part of Gods plan
So at night when I talk him I got my gun in my hand
Dont think Im crazy cause I dont fear man
Cause I feel when I kill a man God wont understand
I got a head full of evil thoughts am I Satan
I been coulda killed these niggaz Im still waitin
In the telly with to whores a Benz with to doors

You see me in the hood I got atleast two guns
I carry the glock Tony carry my M-ones
Hold me down nigga OGs tryin to rock me

This is my hustle nigga dont knock me
You need some shit with banana clips to try and stop me

If you get shot and run to the cop - You not like me
You aint got no work on the block - You not like me
Its hot you aint got no drop - You not like me

Verse
See I done been to the Pearly Gates they sent me back
The good die young I aint eligable for that
I shot niggaz I been shot sold crack in the street
My attitude is gangsta so I stand some beef
You wanna get acquainted with me you wanna know me
From three point range with a glock I shoot better then Kobe
See a nigga standin next to me he probably my Co-D
See a bitch gettin in my whip she probably gon blow me
See the flow is like a thirty-eight its special yoooooo
A country boy tell ya Im fittin to blowwwww
Im more like a pimp then a trick you knowwww
See Im in this for the paper I dont love the hooos
Niggaz broke in the hood worried about mines
Grown ass men wearin starter piece shines
You know them little pieces with the little stones
Got little clientele fiends call your cell phones
When the gossip starts Im always the topic
You too old for that shit dog why dont you stop it
Shorty I been watchin you watchin me
Now tell me what you like more my watch or me
Haha
If you get shot and run to the cop - You not like me
You aint got no work on the block - You not like me
Its hot you aint got no drop - You not like me
Like me duke you not like me
Ad-libing to the endHey Em you know you my favorite white boy right
I owe you for this one
Ive been patiently waiting for a track to explode on
You can stun if you want and your ass will get rolled on
It feels like my flows been hot for so long
If you thinking Im fucking fall off your so wrong
Innocent in my head like a baby born dead
Destination heaven sit and politic with passengers from nine eleven
The lords blessings leave me lyrically inclined
Shit I aint even gotta try to shine
Gods the seamstress that tailor fitted my pain
I got scriptures in my brain I could spit at your dame
Straight out the good book look niggas is shook
fifty fears no man warrior swing swords like Conan
Picture me pen in hand write lines knowing the sourcell quote it
When I die theyll read this and say a genius wrote it
I grew up without my pops should that make me bitter
I caught cases I copped out does that make me a quitter
In this white mans world Im similar to a squirrel
Lookin for a slut with a nice butt to get a nut
If I get shot today my phone will stop ringing again
These industry niggaz aint friends they know how to pretend
Patiently waiting to make it through all the hating
Debating whether or not you could even weather the storm
Just lay on the table they operating to save you
Its like an angel came to you sent from the heavens above
They think theyre crazy but they aint crazy lets face it shit basically
They just playing sick they aint shit They aint saying shit spray em Fifty
A to the K get in the way Ill bring Dre and them wit me
And turn this day into fucking mayhem you staying with me
Dont let me lose you Im not trying to confuse you
When I let loose with this Uzi and just shoot through your Isuzu
You get the message am I getting through to you
You know whats coming you motherfuckers dont even know do you
Take some Big and some Pac and you mix them up in a pot
Sprinkle a little Big L on top and what the fuck do you got
You got the realest and illest killers tied up in a knot
The Juggernauts of this rap shit like it or not
Its like a fight to the top just to see who died for the spot
You put your life in this nothing like surviving the shot
Yall know what time it is as soon as Fifty signs on this dot
Shit what you know about death threats cause I get a lot
Shady Records was eighty seconds away from the towers
Some cowards fucked with the wrong building they meant to hit ours
Better evacuate all children - nuclear shower
Theres nothing spookier youre now about to witness the power of fuckin Fifty
Ive been patiently waiting for a track to explode on
You can stun if you want and your ass will get rolled on
It feels like my flows been hot for so long
If you thinking Im fucking fall off your so wrong
Ive been patiently waiting for a track to explode on
You can stun if you want and your ass will get rolled on
It feels like my flows been hot for so long
If you thinking Im fucking fall off your so wrong
The guns spark when the shots go off
Its fifty they say its Fifty
See a nigga laid out with his fucking top blown off
Its fifty man that wasnt Fifty they dont holla my name
You shouldnt throw stones if you live in a glass house
And if you got a glass jaw you should watch your mouth
Cause Ill break your face have your ass running
Mumbling to the Jake you going against me dog you making a mistake
Ill split you have you looking like the Michael Jacksons jackets with all them zippers
Im the boss on this boat you can call me skipper
The way I turn the money over you should call me flipper
Your bitch a regular bitch you calling her wifey
I fucked her I feed her fast food you keeping her icy
Im down to sell records but not my soul
Snoop said this in ninety-four We dont love them hoes
I got pennies for my thoughts now Im rich
See the twentys spinning looking mean on the six
Niggas wearing flags cause the colors match they clothes
They get caught in the wrong hood and get filled up with holes motherfucker
Ive been patiently waiting for a track to explode on
You can stun if you want and your ass will get rolled on
It feels like my flows been hot for so long
If you thinking Im fucking fall off your so wrong
Ive been patiently waiting for a track to explode on
You can stun if you want and your ass will get rolled on
It feels like my flows been hot for so long
If you thinking Im fucking fall off your so wrong

To send a mothafucka at you tonight
G-Unit and I aint stoppin to my clique poppin
Swimmin in barrels of money

Im pullin your mask off as soon as you act up
You know what I came for it isnt the game ball

Lloyd Banks
Im wide awake but it still feels like Im dreamin
Forty Cal under my pillow condom feelin my semen
The physical presence of a female form of a demon
Thats why I fuck em and leave em
Get my nut while Im breathin
Cause they thought theyd catch me slippin
Now Im duckin and trippin
Thats a thousand dollar outfit what the fuck is you rippin
You trippin more records could get my ass in position
Death wish for no religion whether Catholic or Christian
Listen I went through mama bitchin in and out the kitchen
With probable cause papa was in and out of prison
You got soldiers but you still gotta respect ours
We got more four fives and nines than a deck of cards
You can take me out the hood but cant take the hood out me
Cause what
Cause Im ghetto Im ghetto
Niggaz hate when you do good
But when you broke your friends and your enemies
They love you they love you
Chi Chi get the llello
Picture me being crack out of town trips on the trail
Chi Chi get the llello
Picture me being crack
Tony Yayo
You can sift me cut me Ill turn you to a junkie

Wallstreet niggaz they cop me on the low
White boys dont call me coke they call me blow
Its time to go on the bus the train the plane
Ill smuggle Im nothin but trouble
Ill make your money double
Cook me in baking soda
Ill turn your Hooprock into a new Range Rover
Ill pay all your bills and fill your frigerator
Feed your family turn your man to a hater
Put me in your doorpanels or your stashbox
Put me in your Niks Timbs or Reeboks
If you cop three and a half you hustlin backwards
Cop a hundred grams
You movin forwards
You tryin to move more birds
In PA all day on the corner of Third
You can take me out the hood
But cant take the hood out me

You know my contestants
As the world turns theres lessons to be learned
Count all my blessins clean up my weapons

Belagio twenty grand in chips at a dice game
Burn out cant stop gotta watch MTV BET
Nigga you see me

Gotta make it to heaven I hope I make it to heaven
Some say Im paranoid I say Im careful how I choose my friends
Been to ICU once I aint going again
First Zee got murked then Raw got murked
An homies still in the hood why he aint getting hurt
I smell somethin fishy man it might be a rat
Damn niggas switching sides on niggas just like that
You know me I stay wit a bitch on her knees
An get guns away in the hood like government cheese
Spray on Suzukis eleven hundred ccs
More plate on the back straight squeezing a Mak
In the hood they identify niggas by they cars
So I switch up whips to stay off the radar
I aint gotta be around to make shit hot
I send Yayo to dump thirty shots on ya block
So spray that Tec nigga if I say get it done
An make it wet niggas if you round me son
I gotta make it to heaven for going through hell
Gotta make it to heaven gotta make it to heaven

Gotta make it to heaven I hope I make it to heaven
I gotta make it to heaven for going through hell
Gotta make it to heaven gotta make it to heaven

When I come through the hood I dont stop the rapping niggaz
Get close enough to smack get it clapping nigga
Pac tried to front so I waved the chrome on his ass
Point blank range I span put a bone on his ass
Two weeks later niggas came through with Maks to lay me down
Then sprayed I played dead and got the fuck off the ground
Out the blue I get a phone call fifty what up
You send a bitch at me I send the bitch back cut up
I dont play that pussy shit I done told you boy
Front on me you gon meet one of my soldiers boy
Cause Entwain shot up his mamma crib an now he in Jail
Trippin on Fliks an bogger trail pussy in black tail
Pack mamma moved but she dont talk to him no more
The shells from twains four-four blew the hinge off her do
Without that Tec every month how she gon pay for the crib
Man social service finis come and take them kids
I gotta make it to heaven for going through hell
Gotta make it to heaven gotta make it to heaven
I gotta make it to heaven for going through hell
Gotta make it to heaven I hope I make it to heaven
I gotta make it to heaven for going through hell
Gotta make it to heaven gotta make it to heaven
I gotta make it to heaven for going through hell
Gotta make it to heaven I hope I make it to heaven
Lord grant me the serenity to accept the things I can not change the courage
To change the things I can but wisdom to know the difference
But A Ade did a make you say that I say that
Thats the credit put in your head when you a case act
Man I might talk to you while we up in the Penz
But when we come home that dont mean we goin fuck an be friends
Shells smash ya head close enough to hear em whistling
Thank god they missed you an go grab ya pistol
In the hood niggas running round acting crazy
Buying little air Jordans for maybe babies
See it might be his an it might be yours
Cause them broads in the projects is straight up whores
Man it dont take much for you to get in them draws
You aint can have em on they back or on all fours
You got to tell me you feeling this shit
Because I hear what Im saying I know Im killing this shit

Gotta make it to heaven gotta make it to heaven
I gotta make it to heaven for going through hell
Gotta make it to heaven I hope I make it to heaven

Gotta make it to heaven I hope I make it to heavenYea
Lets takeem back
Uh huh
Coming up I was confused
My mama kissing a girl
Confusion occurs
Coming up in a cold world
Daddy aint around
Probably out committing felonies
My favorite rapper used to sing
Check check out my melody
I wanna live good so shit I sell dope
For a four-finger ring
One of them gold ropes
Nana told me if I passed I get a sheep skin coat
If I could move a few packs
I get the hat
Now thatll be dope
Tossed and turn in my sleep that night
Woke up the next morning
Niggaz done stole my bike
Different day same shit
Aint nothing good in the hood
I run away from this bitch
And never come back if I could

Ten gz will take your daughter outta air forces
Believe you me homie I know all about losses
Im from Compton where the wrong colors be cautious
One phone call have your body dumped in Marcy
I stay strapped like car seats
Been banging since ma lil nigga rob got killed for his Barkleys
Thats ten years
I told Pooh in ninety-five
Ill kill you if you try me for my air-max ninety-fives
Told Banks when I metem Im a ride
And if I gotta die rather homicide
I aint had fifty cent when ma grand-mama died
Now Im going back to Cali with ma jacob on
See how time fly

And Im gon shine homie until my heart stop
The Game
Goheadn envy me
Im raps MVP
And I aint going no where
So you can get to know me
fifty Cent
From the beginning to the end
Losers lose winners win
This is real we aint gotta pretend
The cold world that we in
Its full of pressure and pain
Enough of me nigga now listen to Game
Game
Used to see five-zero throw the crack by the bench
Now Im fucking with five-zero its all starting to make sense
My Mas happy she aint gotta pay the rent
And she got a red bow on that brand new Benz
Waiting on Sha Money to land sitting in the range
Thinking how they spend thirty million dollars on airplanes
When theres kids starving
Pac is gone and Brenda still throwing babies in the garbage
I wanna know whats going on like I hear Marvin
No school books
They use their wood to build coffins
Whenever Im in a booth
And I get exhausted
I think what if Marie Baker got that abortion
I love you Ma
Chorus
fifty Cent
Hate it or love it the under dogs on top
And Im gon shine homie until my heart stop
The Game
Goheadn envy me
Im raps MVP
And I aint going no where
So you can get to know meI need you to pray for me and
I need you to care for me and
I need you to want me to win
I need to know where Im heading cause I know where Ive been
The flow is bone crushing its nothing I come up with something
Come through your strip fronting stunting
Its something you want seven hundred and forty-five chrome spinners
Haters hate that Im winning
Man Ive been hot from the beginning
Motherfuckers envy the kid control your jealousy
Cause I cant control my temper Im finna catch a felony
Pistol in hand homie Im down to get it popping
Once I squeeze the first shot you know I aint stopping
Till my clip is empty Im simply
Not that nigga you should try your luck with or fuck with
Hollow-tip shells struck you with your bones broken guns smoking still locing
What nigga lay your ass down paramedics get you up feeling
Right now Im on the edge so dont push me
I aim straight for your head so dont push me
Fill your ass up with leadso dont push me
I got something for your ass keep thinking Im pussy
Right now Im on the edge so dont push me
I aim straight for your head so dont push me
Fill your ass up with leadso dont push me
I got something for your ass keep thinking Im pussy
I done lost my bigger nigga and I didnt cry
To young to understand the consequences of a man
Living a lie I gotta get that money
Ill be damned if Im bummy
Gotta watch my back around these niggas cause they funny
twenty years of watching my mamas tears got my heated heavily weeded
Smoking that bong cause I need it
These niggas dont want me balling they want me buried
Bogged in the dirt from shots flurried
Laying with bugs under my shirt
I got plans to hop up in that Hummer
Cause Im a stunner I sit back and wonder
When them angels gonna call my number under
My chest is a heart of a lion
I aint lying bounty hunters got me flying
With my iron high as a giant
Im running from nothing my stomach is touching what Im clutching
To give you more than a concussion end of discussion
My blood is colder so Im bolder
Hennessy and soda hood on my shoulder
Look in the mirror I see a soldier
Right now Im on the edge so dont push me
I aim straight for your head so dont push me
Fill your ass up with leadso dont push me
I got something for your ass keep thinking Im pussy
Right now Im on the edge so dont push me
I aim straight for your head so dont push me
Fill your ass up with leadso dont push me
I got something for your ass keep thinking Im pussy
These are my ideas this is my sweat and tears
This is shit that I saw with my eyeballs my ears
This is me whos gotta be what you see on TV
What you hear on CD what appears easy
Man these teenie boppers see me on these magazine covers
In these beanies and these rags living fantasies
Fronting like its all fun and games til the shoot em up bang
And you see your brains hang and you see we aint playing
Aint saying we aint laying down at night and aint praying
I bullied my way in this game man Im done playing
Man Im done saying that Im done playing
Imma start laying into these motherfucking cocksuckers
Theres no way Im back down like a god damn coward
I cant how would I look as a man bowing to his knees
Like the mad cow disease let somebody lash out at me
And not lash back out at em please
Oh whoa yo ho hold up oh no not me not Marshall
You wanna see Marshall Ill show you Marshall
I try to show you art but you just pick it apart
So I see I have to start showing you fucking old farts
A whole other side I wanted to not show you
So you know youre not dealing with some fucking marshmallow
Little soft yellow punk pussy whose hearts Jello cause
Right now Im on the edge so dont push me
I aim straight for your head so dont push me
Fill your ass up with leadso dont push me
I got something for your ass keep thinking Im pussy
Right now Im on the edge so dont push me
I aim straight for your head so dont push me
Fill your ass up with leadso dont push me
I got something for your ass keep thinking Im pussy
Shady Aftermath nigga G-Unit

The drama really means nothing to me
Ill ride by and blow ya brains out
Theres no time to cock it no way you can stop it
When niggas run up on you with them thangs out

The DA can play this motherfucking tape in court

I aint playing hear what Im saying homie I aint playing
Catch you slipping Imma kill you
I aint playing hear what Im saying homie I aint playing
Keep thinking Im candy till ya fucking skull get popped
And ya brain jump out the top like Jack-in-the-box
In the hood summer time is the killing season
Its hot out this bitch thats a good enough reason
Ive seen gangstas get religious when they start bleeding
Saying Lord Jesus help me cause they ass leaking
When they window roll down and that AK come out
You can squeeze ya little handgun until you run out
And you can run for ya backup
But them machine gun shells gone tear ya back up
Gods on ya side Shit Im aight with that
Cause we gon reload them clips and come right back
Its a fact homie you go against me ya fucked
I get the drop if you can duck ya luckier then Lady Luck

And let ya ass look for me
If theres beef cock it and dump it
The drama really means nothing to me

I aint playing hear what Im saying homie I aint playing
Catch you slipping Imma kill you
I aint playing hear what Im saying homie I aint playing
My heart bleeds for you nigga I cant wait to get to you
Behind that twinkle in ya eyes I can see the bitch in you
Nigga you know the streets talk
So theyll be no white flags and no peace talks
I got my back against the wind Im down to ride till the sun burn out
If I die today Im happy how my life turned out
See the shootouts that Ive been in Im by myself
Locked up I was in a box by myself
I done made myself a millionaire by myself
Now shit changed motherfucker I can hire some help
I done heard about the fifty grand you put in the hood
But ya shooter finnin to get shot it wont do him no good
With a pistol I define the definition of pain
If you survive ya bonesll still fucking hurt when it rain
Oh you a pro at playing battleship Well this aint the same
Little homie this is a whole different type of war game
See the losers end up in shackles and motherfucking chains
Or laid out in the streets leaking out they brains
If theres beef cock it and dump it
The drama really means nothing to me
Ill ride by and blow ya brains out
Theres no time to cock it no way you can stop it
When niggas run up on you with them thangs out
I do what I gotta do I dont care I if get caught
The DA can play this motherfucking tape in court
Ill kill you
I aint playing hear what Im saying homie I aint playing
Catch you slipping Imma kill you
I aint playing hear what Im saying homie I aint playing
After the fist fights its gunfire boy you get the best of me
If you dont wanna get shot I suggest you dont go testing me
All the wrong Ive done the Lord still keep on blessing me
Finnin to run rap cause Dr Dre got the recipeGo go go go go go go shawty

We gon sip Bacardi like its your birthday
And you know we dont give a fuck

But homie aint nothing change hold down Gs up

If you watch how I move youll mistake me for a player or pimp
Been hit wit a few shells but I dont walk wit a limp
In the hood then the ladies saying fifty you hot
They like me I want them to love me like they love Pac
But holla in New York them niggasll tell ya Im loco
And the plan is to put the rap game in a choke hold

And you should love it way more then you hate it
Nigga you mad I thought that youd be happy I made it
Im that cat by the bar toasting to the good life
You that fagot ass nigga trying to pull me back right
When my junk get to pumping in the club its on

If the roof on fire let the motherfucker burn
If you talking bout money homie I aint concerned

You dont see me in the hood its cause Im doing this man
Niggas Im still grinding yeah I still hearing those sirens
Im still getting chased by those lights
Only the lights lime and my mics on
And my time is none because Im writing more
I dont hear to meet a soul in this business
Im here to eat speak until these hos feel this
I aint gonna let you derail me man
I got Young Kobe homey you gotta let go of Obie
Cause Obie be back going nowhere man we got them craps going on
And that yak going on soon as a nigga touch down back from town
Its forever put that on the cheddar man
But in the meantime its Jimmy Iovine time
Chase cheese rhyme til my voice give out
This is it my niggas this what we boast about
Now Im here so shut your motherfucking mouth and show me love bitch
Chorus
I just want to love for the rest of my life I dont love you bitch
I want to hold you in the morn hold you thorough the night
Right we want to love alcohol we want to love guns we want to love money
we dont love no bitches though
I just want to love for the rest of my life
I want to hold you in the morn hold you in the night
Eminem
Theres a certain mystique when I speak that you notice
Cause its sort of unique cause you know its me
My poetrys deep and Im still-matic the way I flow to this beat
You cant sit still its like trying to smoke crack and go to sleep
Im strapped its known any minute I could snap
Im the equivalent of what would happen if Bush rapped
I bully these rappers so bad lyrically
It aint even funny I aint even hungry it aint even money
You cant pay me enough for you to play me
Its cockamamie you just aint zany enough to rock with Shady
My noodle is cock-a-doodle my clocks coo-coo
I got screws loose yea the whole kit and caboodle Im just brutal
Its no rumor Im numero uno assume it theres no more humor in it you know
Im rolling with a swollen bowling ball in my bag
You need a fag and tear a new hole in my ass you better love me bitch
Chorus
fifty Cent
My buzz is crazy in the hood they holla my name
If it aint about the flow its bout the stones and the chain
If I was you Id love men too I roll like a boss
Nine eleven Porsche same color as cranberry sauce
I aint gon front I thought R Kelly was the shit
Let me find out he fucking round with Bow Wow bitch
Niggas eating popcorn right rewinding the tape
Now shorty mama in the precinct hollering rape
Im convinced man something really wrong with these hos
I thought Lil Kim was hot til she start fucking with her nose
I used to listen to Lauryn Hill and tap my feet
Then the bitch put out a CD and didnt have no beats
That nigga DAngelo he determined not to fail
That nigga went butt-ass for his record to sell
My back shot to help Ashanti hit them high notes
And Big Ben taught Charlie B More to deep throat yea
Chorus
fifty Cent
I love the burners the money the bunnies I just want to hold you ha ha
I just want to love you yeaMan we gotta go get something to eat man
Im hungry as a motherfucker
Hey yo man damn whats taking homie so long son
fifty calm down here he come
What the fuck
Son pull up pull up
Many men wish death upon me
Blood in my eye dog and I cant see
Im trying to be what Im destined to be
And niggas trying to take my life away
I put a hole in nigga for fucking with me
My back on the wall now you gon see
Better watch how you talk when you talk about me
Cause Ill come and take your life away
Many men many many many many men
Wish death pon me
Lord I dont cry no more
Dont look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me
Now these pussy niggas putting money on my head
Go on and get your refund motherfucker I aint dead
Im the diamond in the dirt that aint been found
Im the underground king and I aint been crowned
When I rhyme something special happen every time
Im the greatest something like Ali in his prime
I walk the block with the bundles
Ive been knocked on the humble
Swing the ox when I rumble
Show your ass what my gun do
Got a temper nigga go head lose your head
Turn your back on me get clapped and lose your legs
I walk around gun on waist chip on my shoulder
Till I bust a clip in your face pussy this beef aint over
Many men many many many many men
Wish death pon me
Lord I dont cry no more
Dont look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me
Have mercy on my soul
Somewhere my heart turned cold
Have mercy on many men
Many many many many men
Wish death upon me
Sunny days wouldnt be special if it wasnt for rain
Joy wouldnt feel so good if it wasnt for pain
Death gotta be easy cause life is hard
Itll leave you physically mentally and emotionally scarred
This if for my niggas on the block twisting trees and cigars
For the niggas on lock doing life behind bars
I dont see only god can judge me cause I see things clear
Quick these crackers will give my black ass a hundred years
Im like Paulie in Goodfellas you can call me the Don
Like Malcolm by any means with my gun in my palm
Slim switched sides on me let niggas ride on me
I thought we was cool why you want me to die homie
Many men many many many many men
Wish death pon me
Lord I dont cry no more
Dont look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me
Have mercy on my soul
Somewhere my heart turned cold
Have mercy on many men
Many many many many men
Wish death upon me
Every night I talk to god but he dont say nothing back
I know he protecting me but I still stay with my gat
In my nightmares niggas keep pulling techs on me
Psych says some bitch dumb put a hex on me
The feds didnt know much when Pac got shot
I got a kite from the pens that told me Tuck got knocked
I aint gonna spell it out for you motherfuckers all the time
Are you illiterate nigga You cant read between the lines
In the bible it says what goes around comes around
Almost shot me three weeks later he got shot down
Now its clear that Im here for a real reason
Cause he got hit like I got hit but he aint fucking breathing
Many men many many many many men
Wish death pon me
Lord I dont cry no more
Dont look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me
Have mercy on my soul
Somewhere my heart turned cold
Have mercy on many men
Many many many many men
Wish death upon meHey Em you know you my favorite white boy right
I owe you for this one
Ive been patiently waiting for a track to explode on
You can stun if you want and your ass will get rolled on
It feels like my flows been hot for so long
If you thinking Im fucking fall off your so wrong
Innocent in my head like a baby born dead
Destination heaven sit and politic with passengers from nine eleven
The lords blessings leave me lyrically inclined
Shit I aint even gotta try to shine
Gods the seamstress that tailor fitted my pain
I got scriptures in my brain I could spit at your dame
Straight out the good book look niggas is shook
fifty fears no man warrior swing swords like Conan
Picture me pen in hand write lines knowing the sourcell quote it
When I die theyll read this and say a genius wrote it
I grew up without my pops should that make me bitter
I caught cases I copped out does that make me a quitter
In this white mans world Im similar to a squirrel
Lookin for a slut with a nice butt to get a nut
If I get shot today my phone will stop ringing again
These industry niggaz aint friends they know how to pretend
Patiently waiting to make it through all the hating
Debating whether or not you could even weather the storm
Just lay on the table they operating to save you
Its like an angel came to you sent from the heavens above
They think theyre crazy but they aint crazy lets face it shit basically
They just playing sick they aint shit They aint saying shit spray em Fifty
A to the K get in the way Ill bring Dre and them wit me
And turn this day into fucking mayhem you staying with me
Dont let me lose you Im not trying to confuse you
When I let loose with this Uzi and just shoot through your Isuzu
You get the message am I getting through to you
You know whats coming you motherfuckers dont even know do you
Take some Big and some Pac and you mix them up in a pot
Sprinkle a little Big L on top and what the fuck do you got
You got the realest and illest killers tied up in a knot
The Juggernauts of this rap shit like it or not
Its like a fight to the top just to see who died for the spot
You put your life in this nothing like surviving the shot
Yall know what time it is as soon as Fifty signs on this dot
Shit what you know about death threats cause I get a lot
Shady Records was eighty seconds away from the towers
Some cowards fucked with the wrong building they meant to hit ours
Better evacuate all children - nuclear shower
Theres nothing spookier youre now about to witness the power of fuckin Fifty
Ive been patiently waiting for a track to explode on
You can stun if you want and your ass will get rolled on
It feels like my flows been hot for so long
If you thinking Im fucking fall off your so wrong
Ive been patiently waiting for a track to explode on
You can stun if you want and your ass will get rolled on
It feels like my flows been hot for so long
If you thinking Im fucking fall off your so wrong
The guns spark when the shots go off
Its fifty they say its Fifty
See a nigga laid out with his fucking top blown off
Its fifty man that wasnt Fifty they dont holla my name
You shouldnt throw stones if you live in a glass house
And if you got a glass jaw you should watch your mouth
Cause Ill break your face have your ass running
Mumbling to the Jake you going against me dog you making a mistake
Ill split you have you looking like the Michael Jacksons jackets with all them zippers
Im the boss on this boat you can call me skipper
The way I turn the money over you should call me flipper
Your bitch a regular bitch you calling her wifey
I fucked her I feed her fast food you keeping her icy
Im down to sell records but not my soul
Snoop said this in ninety-four We dont love them hoes
I got pennies for my thoughts now Im rich
See the twentys spinning looking mean on the six
Niggas wearing flags cause the colors match they clothes
They get caught in the wrong hood and get filled up with holes motherfucker
Ive been patiently waiting for a track to explode on
You can stun if you want and your ass will get rolled on
It feels like my flows been hot for so long
If you thinking Im fucking fall off your so wrong
Ive been patiently waiting for a track to explode on
You can stun if you want and your ass will get rolled on
It feels like my flows been hot for so long
If you thinking Im fucking fall off your so wrong

All money aint good money this I know

And as a youngster a n went to so much church
And still turned out fed up I did so much dirt
Chose to bang the neighborhood I put in so much work
Did a whole lot of time caused mom so much hurt
On every thang that boy wasnt gunned on purpose
Who knew that all my darkness was really gon surface
I was stuck on that bulls just runnin the streets
Without some type of beef the week wasnt complete
Its like a n feel better after dumpin his heat
On feet just to see that body slumped in the seat
Was like a whole nother rush to me bustin was sweet

Im on the road spend thirty days a month in a suite

Some of the levels that these peoplell go to for crumbs
Damn tell me is this what that dough do
Thats when you find yourself talkin to Pro Tools
Theres not too many that ever walked in the Loc shoes
Or tell the tale that my heart contains
I explain so many different parts of pain
Im clean but still some marks remain
From the past when that kush weed sparks the brain
The cash made some people start to change
I feel hate when I pulled up and parked the Range
Your damn right I got rich but my heart the same
And practice makes perfect with the art of aim
You aint really got the heart to bang
You aint start to hang til you found out I caught the chain

Lloyd Banks
Still walk around wit the hammer boss
Rope and a cross
Hard timesll make a lil nigga hate Santa Claus
Your mountains is high holdin in Diana Ross
Im like a two thousand and three banana Porsche
I dont gotta hide sluts to get your ties cut
They on my dick cause I make groupies set off a fire truck
My team in the cutt packin middle things
I got more foreign shooters than the Sacramento Kings
Its eight class karats in the border
I poke holes in plastic to avoid a vaginal disorder
Im a savage on your daughter
She aint in the college dorm
Then I guess Im squirtin on the cabin that you bought her
Im a heavy weed smoker so the average is a quarter
Brown colored from shit he established in the water
You got Banks on your jersey you part of my fan base
Just cause you pour syrup on shit dont make it pancakes
ChorusYeah this somethin special whyknow somethin epic
Lloyd Banks you know
Cause a nigga thuggin dont mean he dont
Dont wanna see you smile baby
I wanna be the reason you smile
I wanna be the reason you smile
I wanna be the reason you smile
After you wipe away your tears and dry your eyes
Im gettin the feelin you wanna take revenge
From the conversations we have and the way it ends
You wanna discuss me in front of your lady friends
Thats why its just me and my Mercedes Benz
It all depends maybe if we make amends
We can start from scratch
Learn to control your temper and remarks in fact
We plan to be platonic with our hearts in tact
So every time we separate somebodys marchin back
Youre amazing in the sack eyes slanted like youre Asian
But youre black God bless whoever gave you alla that
If you seen her from the back youd understand why dis feel like that
And aint a flaw to her toes the Lord knows
Her pussy good enough to miss award shows
And I aint gotta say nothin she just knows
By the way I look at her to take off all her clothes up and down
Whenever Im not around and you feelin down
Let the thought of me be
I wanna be the reason you smile
I dont wanna see you frown like them kids watch a clown
I wanna bring you joy and be
I wanna be the reason you smile
Baby you know my style you know how I get down
I provide by any means to be
I wanna be the reason you smile
We done been through ups and downs had drama for a while
Im just happy Im around to be
I wanna be the reason you smile
The main reason I been lookin at you pitiful
What about the half of this shit I done did to you
Violated and tiptoed into a crib or two
Ive come clean to be a bigger individual
Even though youre busy boo the evenings when I visit you
Kinda makes me feel lucky cause I see niggaz
When you tease em with your physical
She wanna rack up her brooms I aint got no more room left
Wild drama section eight princess
My foreign chick bad but she been stressed
Cause its hard to communicate
Cause she dont speak-a no English
I been around the world from state to state
But now Im back bustin in your bathroom
Got you laughin in your shower cap
Lets get it on
Cause Im leavin in a hour fly-through
Dont matter shes mad even when I holla back
All I really need your attention for a while
And I bet you I can make you smile
Whenever Im not around and you feelin down
Let the thought of me be
I wanna be the reason you smile
I dont wanna see you frown like them kids watch a clown
I wanna bring you joy and be
I wanna be the reason you smile
Baby you know my style you know how I get down
I provide by any means to be

First shot pop off everybody popping shots
The glass at the store front we forgot God was watching
Run run hit the gate Ds yelling drop it
Niggas getting jammed up better that than a jammed up
His momma said a few words to her he was innocent

Im from that city full of yellow cabs and skyscrapers
Its hard to get a start in these parts without paper
Homie I grew up in hell a block away from heaven
That corner every fifteen minutes it move a seven
Pure snow bag it then watch it go
Occupational options get some blow or some hoes
Shoot the bowl or the strap learn to rap or to jack
Fuck it man in the mean time go ahead and pump a pack
This my regal royal flow my James Bond bounce
That seven that sixty-two on my count
Im a undercover liar I lie under the covers
Look a bitch in the eyes and tell her baby I love it
Youre my inspiration youre my motivation
Youre the reason that Im moving with no hesitation
They say this is a big rich town
I just come from the poorest part
Bright lights city life I gotta make it
This is where it goes down
I just happen to come up hard
Legal or illegal baby I gotta make it
I gotta hustle through the hustle and bust while I make a move
Manuever around the rats and wolves Im from the school
Of hard knocks shots pop bodies drop
Graveyard pick a plot cause niggas want your spots
Im trying to stack shit then I go legit
Hollow tip stuff em in a clip case niggas trip
My cocaine endeavours give me corporate ties
Im supposed to lose watch me win against the odds
All I got is my word balls and my instinct
Im trying to make it we already made it my friends think
We already on top I got a bigger plan
No more controlled substances or hand to hand
White collar visions game changing mission
Big risks big wins equal bigger living
Perfect position watch me transition
From caterpillar to butterfly in the skyNigga you pussy you scared
I can hear your heartbeat
Why the fuck would you come around here
I can hear your heartbeat
Yeah you know a dog sense fear
I can hear your heartbeat
You bark while we bite around here
I can hear your heartbeat
We aint cut from the same cloth we into different shit
I want the bread you want the bitch
Come out your mouth slick Ill get you hit
My niggas hungry they hit a lick
Fuck who youre with niggasll dump a clip
We by the school yard waiting for you to get your kid
I caught a Aone felony on my last bid
Kept calm made bond Im on that shit
You think my rap shit a gimmick I aint seen parole in a minute
Truth be told these niggas is hoes
Once the shit set off man anything goes
Through the windows of your soul the eyes never lie
If you aint scared to die nigga why would you cry
Nigga you pussy you scared
I can hear your heartbeat
Why the fuck would you come around here
I can hear your heartbeat
Yeah you know a dog sense fear
I can hear your heartbeat
You bark while we bite around here
I can hear your heartbeat
thirty something and you aint even open your mouth yet
Social media is giving cowards an outlet
See him in person say something I doubt that
Rather get caught with it than get caught without that
Trying to back peddle and stumble on the curve
You starin at the ground you mumblin your words
Literally I can see your heart pumpin through your shirt
Pussy your whole life you always been a bird
Scared for so long its all up in your nerves
Screw nine-one-one you probably call up the reserves
And Im killin you first if we ever do a purge
And you know what it is kid whenever we emerge
And Im tragical traumatical no match incompatible
Nigga you vaginal
Nigga you pussy you scared
I can hear your heartbeat
Why the fuck would you come around here
I can hear your heartbeat
Yeah you know a dog sense fear
I can hear your heartbeat
You bark while we bite around here
I can hear your heartbeat
Money for bail money to bail
Dead or in jail Heaven or Hell
FEDs on my coat tail snitches given court tells
Kept fate when all hope fail
Niggas rattin all they missin is the tail like Mickey Mouse
Call me Mickey Mantle when I bat you in the mouth
I bring them hammers out we aint trying to build a house
Niggas on them songs rappin shit they aint about
Im from the N-O we dont scrap we bang it out
Bang Im the one that came in your house for the chickens
Left a nigga brains hangin out like we chillin
Stankin like shipments over my shillings
Hump your security Rida gang in the building
Nigga you pussy you scared
I can hear your heartbeat
Why the fuck would you come around here
I can hear your heartbeat
Yeah you know a dog sense fear
I can hear your heartbeat
You bark while we bite around here
I can hear your heartbeatHook fifty Cent
