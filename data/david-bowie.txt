VERSE there
Was she never therehere
Was she ever
Was it air she breathed
At the wrong time
Oh-oh
Oh-oh
All the flowers so
From the gallery
With the hymns of night
Singing Come to Me
CHORUS
At the wrong time
On the wrong day
All the lights are fading now
If Im dreaming all my life  second time
Just one living chance
When the mother sighs
When the father steps aside
At the wrong time
Oh-oh
VERSE here
CHORUS
Was she ever
Was she ever here
If Im dreaming all my life
If Im dreaming all my life away
Dreaming my life
Dreaming my
Dreaming my
Dreaming my
Dreaming my life
Dreaming my life away
Oh-oh
REPEAT
Dreaming my life
Dreaming my
Dreaming my life away
Oh-ohI forgot what my father said
I forgot what he said
I forgot what my mother said
As we lay upon your bed
A city full of flowers
A city full of rain
I got seven days to live my life
Or seven ways to die
I forgot what my brother said
I forgot what he said
I dont regret anything at all
I remember how we wept
On a bridge of violent people
I was small enough to cry
I got seven days to live my life
Or seven ways to die
Hold my face before you
Still my trembling heart
Seven days to live my life
Or seven ways to die
The gods forgot they made me
So I forget them too
I listen to the shadows
I play among their graves
My heart was never broken
My patience never tried
I got seven days to live my life
Or seven ways to die
Seven days to live my life
Or seven ways to die
SevenI cant read and I cant write down
I dont know a book from countdown
I dont care which shadow gets me
All Ive got is someones face
Money goes to money heaven
Bodies go to body hell
I just cough and catch the chase
Switch the channel watch the police car
I cant read shit anymore
I just sit back and ignore
Cause I just cant get it right cant get it right
I cant read shit I cant read shit
When you see a famous smile
No matter where you run your mile
To be right in that photograph
Andy wheres my fifteen minutes fifteen yeahAll of my life Ive tried so hard
Doing my best with what I had
Nothing much happened all the same
Something about me stood apart
A whisper of hope that seemed to fail
Maybe Im born right out of my time
Breaking my life in two
Throw me tomorrow oh oh
Now that I really got a chance
Throw me tomorrow oh oh
Everythings falling into place
Throw me tomorrow oh oh
Seeing my past to let it go
Throw me tomorrow oh oh
Only for you I dont regret
And I was Thursdays child
Monday Tuesday Wednesday born I was
Monday Tuesday Wednesday born I was
Sometimes I cry my heart to sleep
Shuffling days and lonesome nights
Sometimes my courage fell to my feet
Lucky old son is in my sky
Nothing prepared me for your smile
Lighting the darkness of my soul
Innocence in your arms
Throw me tomorrow oh oh
Now that I really got a chance
Throw me tomorrow oh oh
Oh ho everythings falling into place
Throw me tomorrow oh oh
Seeing my past to let it go
Throw me tomorrow oh oh
Only for you I dont regret
And I was Thursdays child
Monday Tuesday Wednesday born I was
Thursdays child
Monday Tuesday Wednesday born I was
Thursdays child
Monday Tuesday Wednesday born I was
Monday Tuesday Wednesday born I was
Monday Tuesday Wednesday born I was
Monday Tuesday Wednesday born I wasOh my
Naked eyes
I should have kept you
I should have tried
I should have been a wiser kind of guy
I miss you
Give me wings
Give me space
Give me money for a change of face
Those noisy rooms and passion pants
I loved you
Wheres the morning in my life
Wheres the sense in staying right
Who said time is on my side
Ive got ears and eyes and nothing in my life
But Ill survive your naked eyes
Ill survive
You alone across the floor
You and me and nothing more
Youre the great mistake I never made
I never lied to you I hated when you lied
But Ill survive your naked eyes
Ill survive
Beatle boys all snowy white
Razzle dazzle clubs every night
Wish Id sent a Valentine
I love you
Ill survive
Naked eyes
Ill survive

My naked eyes
Ill survive

And I paint the pretty colours Enghlish
Well creep together you and I
For I know who this warfriend is likeTheres a full time reservation
Made in a bar at the railway station
And theres a story a kind of fable
On a card at the corner table
On it is a message been there some time
It starts of The coffee tasted so fine
It says One day this may find you
These few words may remind you
We sat here together just to pass time
You said how the coffee tasted so fine
It goes on to say I love you
If you should find this I must hear from you
It gives a number but the name has faded away
All that is left are just the words Maybe someday
Thats the story and the fable
Never leave alone from a corner table

Though nothing nothing will keep us together
We can beat them forever and ever
Oh we can be heroes just for one day
I I will be King
And you you will be Queen
Though nothing will drive them away
We can be heroes just for one day
We can be us just for one day
I I can remember
I remember
Standing by the wall
By the wall
And the guns shot above our heads
Over our heads
And we kissed as though nothing could fall
Nothing could fall
And the shame was on the other side
Oh we can beat them forever and ever
Then we could be heroes just for one day
We can be heroes
We can be heroes
We can be heroes just for one day
We can be heroesDid you ever have a dream or two
Where the hero is a guy named you
And the things he does are just too much
Does he fly like Mr Superman speak Chinese French and Dutch
And did you ever have a dream or two
Have you ever woken up one day
With the feeling that youd been away
If the girl that you dreamed of last night
Had the same dream in the very same scene
With the very same boy hold tight
Its a very special knowledge that youve got my friend
You can travel anywhere with anyone you care
Its a very special knowledge that youve got my friend
You can walk around in New York while you sleep in Penge
I will travel round the world one night
On the magic wings of astral flight
If youve got the secret tell me do
Have you ever had a dream or two
Have you ever had a dream or twoI
I will be king
And you
You will be queen
Though nothing will
Drive them away
We can beat them
Just for one day
We can be Heroes
Just for one day
And you
You can be mean
And I
Ill drink all the time
Cause were lovers
And that is a fact
Yes were lovers
And that is that
Though nothing
Will keep us together
We could steal time
Just for one day
We can be Heroes
For ever and ever

Als ob nichts geschieht
Und die Scham fiel auf ihre Seite
Oh wir koennen sie schlagen
Fuer alle Zeiten
Dann sind wir Helden
Nur diesen Tag
Dann sind wir Helden
Dann sind wir Helden

Waiting at the lights know what I mean
Scary monsters super creeps

She asked for my love and I gave her a dangerous mind
Now shes stupid in the street and she cant socialise

Life is a circus
Its not fair
Life is a hard road
When youre not there
At the fair
Friends come to see me
and with what way shall I go
To see the show
to help my friend and fall
oh let them find me down
When will they realize
To laugh and drag my name on the ground
The circus must go

To the fair
Papa he talks to me
Dont try your heart
Gets deep inside you
Does you real harm
Dont you care
I like the worker
and with what way shall I go
Stand straight and tall
to help my friend and fall

Don t lose your balance
To laugh and drag my name on the ground

Youve really made the grade
And the papers want to know whose shirts you wear
Now its time to leave the capsule if you dare
This is Major Tom to Ground Control
Im stepping through the door
And Im floating in a most peculiar way
And the stars look very different today
For here
Am I sitting in a tin can
Far above the world
Planet Earth is blue
And theres nothing I can do
Though Im past one hundred thousand miles
Im feeling very still
And I think my spaceship knows which way to go
Tell my wife I love her very much she knows
Ground Control to Major Tom
Your circuits dead theres something wrong
Can you hear me Major Tom
Can you hear me Major Tom
Can you hear me Major Tom
Can you Here am I floating round my tin can
Far above the moon
Planet Earth is blue
And theres nothing I can doDavid Bowie
Early On one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-four-sixty-six
Im Not Loosing Sleep
Yes ive read the morning papers
Telling me that youve made money
Do you think im gonna crawl then think again
Though im dressed in rags im richer
Though i eat from tins im healthier
Though i live in slums im purer than you my friend
Too bad im not losing sleep
too bad im just counting sheep
too bad im not losing sleep my friend
Look around and see the friends
The ones you left our friends deserted
See the guys that used to talk and drink with you
Dont look down your nose at me
cause i wont ask your sympathy
I wont be your yes-sir man for anything
Too bad im not losing sleep
too bad im just counting sheep
too bad im not losing sleep my friend
I would walk with you
Talk with you drink with you
If you drop that halo that youre wearing on the ground
Too bad im not losing sleep
too bad im just counting sheep
too bad im not losing sleep my friend
I cant get my satisfaction
Knowing you wont get reaction
What makes me the big attraction anyway
Its too bad im not losing sleep
too bad im just counting sheep
too bad im not losing sleep my friend
Too bad im not losing sleep
too bad im just counting sheep
too bad im not losing sleep my friend
Oh its too bad im not losing sleep
too bad im just counting sheep
too bad im not losing sleep my friendOh oh oh little China girl
Oh oh oh little China girl
I could escape this feeling with my China girl
I feel a wreck without my little China girl
I hear her heart beating loud as thunder
Saw they stars crashing
Im a mess without my little China girl
Wake up mornings wheres my little China girl
I hear her hearts beating loud as thunder
Saw they stars crashing down
I feel a-tragic like Im Marlon Brando
When I look at my China girl
I could pretend that nothing really meant too much
When I look at my China girl
I stumble into town just like a sacred cow
Visions of swastikas in my head
Plans for everyone
Its in the whites of my eyes
My little China girl
You shouldnt mess with me
Ill ruin everything you are
You know Ill give you television
Ill give you eyes of blue
Ill give you mens who want to rule the world
And when I get excited
My little China girl says
Oh baby just you shut your mouth
She says sh-sh-shhh
She says sh-sh-shhh
She says
She says
And when I get excited
My little China girl says
Oh baby just you shut your mouth

Leave em a note saying Happy New Year
I know all the best ways to break out of here
I helped a young laddie called Ivan
I bundled him over the wall last night
Then he climbed back and he grabbed me tight
He uttered some words that I cant say to you
Cause he remembered that he was a screw
Over the wall we go
All coppers are nanas
Over the wall we go
Leave em a note saying Happy New Year
My name is Henry though some say Im thick
Ive spent half me life in and out of the nick
My mum sends me presents to keep me in style
Soggy old cakes and hundreds of files
Now I sussed all them files Im a clever young man
Now I look stupid with manicured hands
Over the wall we go
All coppers are nanas
Over the wall we go

In such an early song
Ive heard a rumor from Ground Control
Oh no dont say its true
They got a message from the Action Man
Im happy hope youre happy too
Ive loved all Ive needed love
Sordid details following
The shrieking of nothing is killing just
Pictures of Jap girls in synthesis and I
Aint got no money and I aint got no hair
But Im hoping to kick but the planet its glowing
Ashes to ashes funk to funky
We know Major Toms a junkie
Strung out in heavens high
Hitting an all-time low
Time and again I tell myself
Ill stay clean tonight
But the little green wheels are following me
Oh no not again
Im stuck with a valuable friend
Im happy hope youre happy too
One flash of light but no smoking pistol
I never done good things I never done good things
I never done bad things I never done bad things
I never did anything out of the blue woh-o-oh
Want an axe to break the ice
Wanna come down right now
Ashes to ashes funk to funky
We know Major Toms a junkie
Strung out in heavens high
Hitting an all-time low
My mother said to get things done
Youd better not mess with Major Tom

Pressure pushing down on me
Pressing down on you no man ask for
Under pressure that brings a building down
Splits a family in two
Puts people on streets
Um ba ba be
Um ba ba be
De day da
Ee day da thats okay
Its the terror of knowing
What the world is about
Watching some good friends
Screaming Let me out
Pray tomorrow gets me higher
Pressure on people people on streets
Day day de mm hm

Its the terror of knowing
What this world is about
Watching some good friends
Screaming Let me out
Pray tomorrow - gets me higher higher high
Pressure on people people on streets
Turned away from it all like a blind man
Sat on a fence but it dont work
Keep coming up with love but its so slashed and torn
Why why why
Love love love love love
Insanity laughs under pressure were breaking
Cant we give ourselves one more chance
Why cant we give love that one more chance
Why cant we give love give love give love give love
Give love give love give love give love give love
Cause loves such an old fashioned word
And love dares you to care for
The people on the People on streets edge of the night
And loves People on streets dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves
This is our last dance
This is ourselves
Under pressure
Under pressure
PressureQuestion-time that says I brought dishonour
My heads bowed in shame
It seems that Ive blackened the family name
Mother says that she cant stand the neighbours talking
Ive gotta pack my bags leave this home start walking yeah
Im guilty
I wish that I was sorry this time
I wish that I could pay for my crime
I cant help thinking about me
I cant help thinking about me
I cant help thinking about me
Remember when we used to go to church on sundays
I lay awake at night terrified of school on mondays
Oh but its too late now
I wish I was a child again
I wish I felt secure again
I cant help thinking about me
I cant help thinking about me
I cant help thinking about me
As I pass a recreation ground
I remember my friends always been found and I cant
I cant help thinking about me
I cant help thinking about me
I cant help thinking about me
Now I leave them all in the never never land
The station seems so cold the tickets in my hand
My girl calls my name hi dave
Drop in see around come back
If youre this way again
Oh Im on my own
Ive got a long way to go
I hope I make it on my own
I cant help thinking about me

Hey hey I should burn too if you should lie upon that bamboo pyre
I dream of Amlapura never saw in all my life a more shining jewel
I dream of Amlapura of an ocean or dream of a princess in stone
Hey hey golden roses around a rajahs mouth
Hey hey all the dead children buried standing
A flying dutchman smoking gun and spice wind
I dream of Amlapura never saw in all my life a more shining jewel
I dream of Amlapura of an ocean or dream of a princess in stoneTheres a brand new dance but I dont know its name

Though nothing nothing will keep us together
We can beat them forever and ever
Oh we can be heroes just for one day
I I will be King
And you you will be Queen
Though nothing will drive them away
We can be heroes just for one day
We can be us just for one day
I I can remember
I remember
Standing by the wall
By the wall
And the guns shot above our heads
Over our heads
And we kissed as though nothing could fall
Nothing could fall
And the shame was on the other side
Oh we can beat them forever and ever
Then we could be heroes just for one day
We can be heroes
We can be heroes
We can be heroes just for one day
We can be heroesIve nothing much to offer
Theres nothing much to take
Im an absolute beginner
But Im absolutely sane
As long as were together
The rest can go to hell
I absolutely love you
But were absolute beginners
With eyes completely open
But nervous all the same
If our love song
Could fly over mountains
Could laugh at the ocean
Just like the films
Theres no reason
To feel all the hard times
To lay down the hard lines
Its absolutely true
Nothing much could happen
Nothing we cant shake
Oh were absolute beginners
With nothing much at stake
As long as youre still smiling
Theres nothing more I need
I absolutely love you
But were absolute beginners
But if my love is your love
Were certain to succeed
If our love song
Could fly over mountains
Sail over heartaches
Just like the films
If theres reason
To feel all the hard times
To lay down the hard lines
Its absolutely trueNo one can blame you for walking away
Too much rejection
No love injection
Life can be easy
Its not always swell
Dont tell me truth hurts little girl
Cause it hurts like hell
But down in the underground
Youll find someone true
Down in the underground
A land serene
A crystal moon ah ah
Its only forever
Not long at all
Lost and lonely

Watch the revolution
No more free steps to heaven
Just walkie-talkie
Heaven or hearth
Just big heads and drums full speed and pagan
And its no game
I am barred
From the event
I really dont understand the situation
So wheres the moral
People have their fingers broken
To be insulted by these fascists is so degrading
And its no game
Documentaries on refugees
Couples gainst the target
Throw a rock against the road
And it breaks into pieces
Draw the blinds on yesterday
And its all so much scarier
Put a bullet in my brain
And it makes all the papers
And its no game
Children round the world
Put camel shit on the walls
Theyre making carpets on treadmills
Or garbage sorting
And its no gameShe had an horror of rooms she was tired you cant hide beat
When I looked in her eyes they were blue but nobody home
She couldve been a killer if she didnt walk the way she do and she do
She opened strange doors that wed never close again
She began to wail jealousies scream
Waiting at the lights know what I mean
Scary monsters super creeps
Keep me running running scared
Scary monsters super creeps
Keep me running running scared
She asked me to stay and I stole her room
She asked for my love and I gave her a dangerous mind
Now shes stupid in the street and she cant socialise
Well I love the little girl and Ill love her till the day she dies
She wails
Jimmys guitar sound jealousies scream
Waiting at the lights know what I mean
Scary monsters super creeps
Keep me running running scared

And I wouldnt go to war
And I mixed with other colors
But the nurse doesnt care
And I hide under blankets
Or did I run away
I really cant remember
Last time I saw the light of day
But I remember Sam cause he was like me
Scream like a baby
Sam was a gun
And I never knew his last name
And we never had no fun
Well they came down hard on the faggots
And they came down hard on the street
They came down harder on Sam
And they all knew he was beat
He was thrown into the wagon
Blindfolded chains and they stomped on us
And took away our clothes and things
And pumped us full of strange drugs
And oh I saw Sam falling
Spitting in their eyes
But now I lay me down to sleep
And now I close my eyes
Now Im learning to be a part of socie-soc-soci-tsociety
Scream like a baby
Sam was a gun
And I never knew his last name
And we never had no fun
No athletic program no discipline no book
He just sat in the backseat swearing hed seek revenge
But he jumped into the furnace singing old songs we loved
Scream like a baby
Sam was a gun
And I never knew his last name
And we never had no fun
Scream like a baby
Sam was a gun
And I never knew his last name
And we never had no funWell I walked in the pouring rain
And I heard a voice that cries Its all in vain
The voice of doom was shining in my room
I just need one day somewhere far away
Lord I just need one day
Well Ive been breaking these rocks
And cutting this hay
Yes Ill be breaking these rocks
It was my price to pay
Oh the rivers so muddy but it may come clear
And I know too well whats keeping me here
Im just the slave of a burning ray
Oh give me the night I cant take another sight
Please please give me the night
Been breaking this rocks
And cutting this hay
Yes Ill be breaking these rocks
Whats my price to pay
Sun keeps beating down on me walls a mile high
Up in the tower theyre watching me hoping Im gonna die
I wont be breaking no rocks
I wont be breaking no rocks
I wont be breaking no rocks
I said I wont be breaking no rocks
I wont be breaking no rocks
Will pardon them I wont be breaking no rocks
Oh-oh-oh-oh
I wont be breaking no rocks
I wont be breaking no rocks

Come out to play
Little metal faced-boy
Dont stay away
Theyre so war-torn and resigned
She cant talk anymore
What are they trying to prove
What would they like to find
Its love back to front and no sides like I say
These pieces are broken like I say
These pieces are broken oh no no no no no
Because youre young
Youll meet a stranger some night
Because youre young
What could be nicer for you
And it makes me sad
So Ill dance my life away
A million dreams a million scars
He punishes hard
Was loving her such a crime
She took back everything she said
Left him nearly out of his mind
Theyre people I know people I love
They seem so unhappy
Dead or alive
Its love back to front and no sides like I say
These pieces are broken like I say
These pieces are broken oh no no no
Because youre young
Youll meet a stranger some night
Because youre young
What could be nicer for you

A million
A million
A millionWell how come you only want tomorrow
With its promise of something hard to do
A real life adventure worth more than pieces of gold
Blue skies above and sun on your arms strength your stride
And hope in those squeaky clean eyes
Youll get chilly receptions everywhere you go
Blinded with desire I guess the season is on
So you train by shadow boxing search for the truth
But its all but its all used up
Break open your million dollar weapon
And push your luck still you push still you push your luck
A broken nosed mogul are you one of the new wave boys
Same old thing in brand new drag comes sweeping into view
As ugly as a teenage millionaire pretending its a whizz kid world
Youll take me aside and say
Well David what shall I do They wait for me in the hallway
Ill say dont ask me I dont know any hallways
But they move in numbers and theyve got me in a corner
I feel like a group of one no no they cant do this to me
Im not some piece of teenage wildlife
Those midwives to history put on their bloody robes
The word is that the hunted one is out there on his own
And youre alone for maybe the last time
And you breathe for a long time
Then you howl like a wolf in a trap
And you darent look behind
You fall to the ground like a leaf from the tree
And look up one time at that vast blue sky
Scream out aloud as they shoot you down
No no Im not a piece of teenage wildlife
Im not a piece of teenage wildlife
And no one will have seen and no one will confess
The fingerprints will prove that you coudnt pass the test
Therell be others on the line filing past wholl whisper low
I miss you he really had to go well each to his own he was
Another piece of teenage wildlife
Another piece of teenage wildlife another piece of teenage wild
Wild
Wild
Wild
The vacuum created by the arrival of freedom
And the possibilities it seems to offer
Its got nothing to do with you if one can grasp it
Its got nothing to do with you if one can grasp it
A series of shocks - sneakers fall apart
Earth keeps on rolling - witnesses falling
Its got nothing to do with you if one can grasp it
Its got nothing to do with you if one can grasp it
Yeah yeah yeah - up the hill backwards
Itll be alright ooh
While we sleep they go to work
Were legally crippled its the death of love
Its got nothing to do with you if one can grasp it
Its got nothing to do with you if one can grasp it
More idols then realities ooh
Im OK youre so-so ooh
Yeah yeah yeah - up the hill backwards
Itll be alright oohOne

Whod have ever thought of it
Whod have ever dreamed
That a small town girl like you
Would be the boss of me
We fly through the night
The tears on your lips
Life has your mind and soul
It spins on your hips
Whod have ever thought of it
Whod have ever dreamed
Whod have ever thought of it
Whod have ever dreamed
That a small town girl like you
Would be the boss of me
Would be the boss of me
Would be the boss of me
You look at me and you reach for the free blue sky
I look to the stars as they flicker and float in your eyes
And under these wings of steel the small town dies
Whod have ever thought of it
Whod have ever dreamed
Whod have ever thought of it
Whod have ever dreamed
That a small town girl like you
Would be the boss of me
Whod have ever thought of it
Whod have ever dreamed

Would be the boss of me
Would be the boss of me
Would be the boss of meNo one ever saw you
Moving through the dark
Leaving slips of paper
Somewhere in the park
Hidden from your friends
Stealing all they knew
Love is thrown in airless rooms
Thin vile rewards for you
And Im gonna tell
Yes Ive gotta tell
Gotta tell the things youve said
When youre talking in the dark
And Im gonna tell the things youve done
When youre walking through the park
Some night on a thrill-less street
Will come a silent gun
Youve got a dangerous part
You stole their trust their moon their sun
Therell come such needle
On a crowded train
I bet youll feel so lonely you could die
Buildings crammed with people
Landscape filled with wrath
Grey concrete city
Rain has wet the street
I want to see you clearly
Before you close the door
A room of bloody history
You made sure of that
I can see you as a corpse
Hanging from a beam
I can read you like a book
I can feel you falling
I hear you moaning in your room
Oh see if I care
Oh please please make it soon
Walls have got you cornered
Youve got the blues my friend
And people dont like you
But you will leave without a sound
But you will leave without a land
Oh feeling so lonely
Death alone shall love you
I bet youll feel so lovely you could die
I feel so lonely you could die
You feel so lonely you could dieStars are never sleeping
Dead ones and the living
We live closer to the earth
Never to the heavens
The stars are never far away
Stars are out tonight
They watch us from behind their shades
Brigitte Jack and Kate and Brad
From behind their tinted window stretch
Gleaming like blackened sunshine
Stars are never sleeping
Dead ones and the living
Waiting for the first move
Satyrs and their child wives
Waiting for the last move
Soaking up our primitive world
Stars are never sleeping
Dead ones and the living
Their jealousys spilling down
The stars must stick together
We will never be rid of these stars
But I hope they live forever
And they know just what we do
That we toss and turn at night
Theyre waiting to make their moves
For the stars are out tonight
Here they are upon the stairs
Sexless and unaroused
They are the stars theyre dying for you
But I hope they live forever
They burn you with their radiant smiles
Trap you with their beautiful eyes
Theyre broke and shamed or drunk or scared
But I hope they live forever
Their jealousys spilling down
The stars must stick together
We will never be rid of these stars
But I hope they live forever
And they know just what we do
That we toss and turn at night
Theyre waiting to make their moves on us
But the stars are out tonight
The stars are out tonight
The stars are out tonightStars are never sleeping

Im gonna say goodbye he says yea
Do not cry she begs of him goodbye yea
All that day she thinks of his love yea
They whip him through the streets and alleys there
The gormless and the baying crowd right there
They cant get enough of that doomsday song
They cant get enough of it all
Listen
Listen to the whores he tells her
He fashions paper sculptures of them
Then drags them to the rivers bank in the cart
Their soggy paper bodies wash ashore in the dark
And the priest stiff in hate now demanding fun begin
Of his women dressed as men for the pleasure of that priest
Here I am
Not quite dying
My body left to rot in a hollow tree
Its branches throwing shadows
On the gallows for me
And the next day
And the next
And another day
Ignoring the pain of their particular diseases
They chase him through the alleys chase him down the steps
They haul him through the mud and they chant for his death
And drag him to the feet of the purple-headed priest
First they give you everything that you want
Then they take back everything that you have
They live upon their feet and they die upon their knees
They can work with satan while they dress like the saints
They know god exists for the devil told them so
They scream my name aloud down into the well below
Here I am
Not quite dying
My body left to rot in a hollow tree
Its branches throwing shadows
On the gallows for me
And the next day
And the next
And another day
Here I am
Not quite dying
My body left to rot in a hollow tree
Its branches throwing shadows
On the gallows for me
And the next day
And the next
And another day
Here I am
Not quite dying
My body left to rot in a hollow tree
Its branches throwing shadows
On the gallows for me
And the next day
And the next
And another dayMidnight in the Village

From Potsdamer Platz
You never knew that
That I could do that
Just walking the dead
Sitting in the Dschungel
On NÃ¼rnberger StraÃe
A man lost in time
Near KaDeWe
Just walking the dead
Where are we now

The moment you know

Everybody drank a lot of something nice
There was an old fashioned band of married men
Looking up to me for encouragement it was so-so
The ladies looked bad but the music was sad
No one took their eyes off Lorraine
She shimmered and she strolled like a Chicago moll
Her feathers looked better and better it was so-so
Yeah it was time to unfreeze
When the reverend alabaster danced on his knees
Slam so it wasnt a game
Cracking all the mirrors in shame
Watch that man oh honey watch that man
He talks like a jerk but he could eat you with a fork and spoon
Watch that man oh honey watch that man
He walks like a jerk
But hes only taking care of the room
Must be in tune
A Benny Goodman fan painted holes in his hands
So shaky hung him up to dry
The pundits were hoking the manholes were smoking
And every bottle battled with the reason why
The girl on the phone wouldnt leave me alone
A throw back from someones LP
A lemon in a bag played the tiger rag
And the bodies on the screen stopped bleeding
Yeah I was shaking like a leaf
For I couldnt understand the conversation
Yeah I ran to the street looking for information
Watch that man oh honey watch that man
He talks like a jerk but he could eat you with a fork and spoon
Watch that man oh honey watch that man
He walks like a jerk
But hes only taking care of the room
Must be in tuneLittle wendy cocaine stumbles up the hill to pain
Nothing stops the go-to girl nothing takes the place of taking aim
Little wendys out there shaking hips and cuckoo eyes
Crazy drives that dizzy crowd
Moonlight strokes the highlights in her hair
She sells and moves and finds my hand
And pulls me down and close so I can hardly stand
As I lay like dead for her Im fed into my head Im led oh I am sam
Im crawling from the window crawling down the wall
Im happy screaming yes I am
Im jumping on her daisy chain
Im speeding through the dancehall like a rocket man
Now I wish today that yesterday was just tomorrow and
I could squeeze her grabby hand
Knowing that I never paid her for a gram
Shes a drunken doxy off her trolly
Sent before her time into this poxy world
Shes not fit for anything but dealing it
While heaven sings I have this girl
Shes got me eating rice and beans
I have no shape nor color Im gods lonely man
I dont want to die but I dont want to live
Im speeding like a rocket man
Like a rocket man
Like a rocket man
Like a rocket maIf you can see me I can see you
I could wear your new blue shoes
I should wear your old red dress
And walk to the crossroads
So take this knife
And meet me across the river
Just shoots and ladders and this is the kiss
American
From nowhere to nothing
And I go way back
Children swarm like thousands of bugs
Towards the lights the beacons above the hill
The stars to the West the South the North and to the East
Now you could say Ive got a gift of sorts
A fear of rear windows and swinging doors
A love of violence and dread of sighs
If you can see me I can see you
If you can see me I can see you
I have seen these bairns wave their fists at God
Swear to destroy the beasts stamping the ground
In their excitement for tomorrow
I could wear your new blue shoes
I should wear your old red dress
And walk to the crossroads
So take this knife
And meet me across the river
I will take your lands and all that lays beneath
The dust of cold flowers prison of dark of ashes
I will slaughter your kind who descend from belief
I am the spirit of greed a lord of theft
Ill burn all your books and the problems they make
If you can see me I can see you
If you can see meTheres a graveyard by the station
Where the girls wear nylon skirts and
Sandals
The boys ride their Riga ones
Upon the little hill
Such sadness and grief
The trees die standing
Thats where we made our trysts
And struggled with our guns
Would you still love me
If the clocks could go backwards
The girls would fill with blood and
The grass would be green again
Remember the dead
They were so great
Some of them
How does the grass grow
Blood blood blood
Where do the boys lie
Mud mud mud
How does the grass grow
Blood blood blood
But I lived a blind life
A white face in prison
But you made a life out of nothing
Now I ride my black horse
I miss you more
Than youll ever ever know
Waiting with my red eyes
And my stone heart
How does the grass grow
Blood blood blood
Where do the boys lie
Mud mud mud
How does the grass grow
Blood blood blood
I gaze in defeat
At the stars in the night
The light in my life burnt away
There will be no tomorrow
Then you sigh in your sleep
And meaning returns with the day
Where do the boys lie
Mud mud mud
How does the grass grow
Blood blood bloodShell come shell go
Shell lay belief on you
Skin sweet with musky odor
The lady from another grinning soul
Cologne shell wear
Silver and Americard
Shell drive a beetle car
And beat you down at cool Canasta
And when the clothes are strewn
Dont be afraid of the room
Touch the fullness of her breast
Feel the love of her caress
She will be your living end
Shell come shell go
Shell lay belief on you
But she wont stake her life on you
How can life become her point of view
And when the clothes are strewn
Dont be afraid of the room
Touch the fullness of her breast
Feel the love of her caress
She will be your living end
She will be your living end
She will be your living end
She will be your living end
She will be your livingUh uh ah Let me put my arms around your head
Dom do ah Gee its hot lets go to bed

You caught yourself a trick down
On Sunset and Vine
But since he pinned you baby
Youre a porcupine
You sold me illusions for a sack full of checks
Youve made a bad connection cause I just want your sexA small Jean Genie snuck off to the city
Strung out on lasers and slash-back blazers
Ate all your razors while pulling the waiters
Talking bout Monroe and walking on Snow White
New Yorks a go-go and everything tastes right
Poor little Greenie ooh-ooh
Keep her comin
The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
Hes outrageous he screams and he bawls Jean Genie
Jean Genie let yourself go whoah
Sits like a man but he smiles like a reptile
She love him she love him but just for a short while
Shell scratch in the sand wont let go his hand
He says hes a beautician and sells you nutrition
And keeps all your dead hair for making up underwear
Poor little Greenie ooh-ooh
The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
Hes outrageous he screams and he bawls Jean Genie
Jean Genie let yourself go whoah
Hes so simple-minded he cant drive his module
He bites on the neon and sleeps in a capsule
Loves to be loved loves to be loved
Oh Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
Hes outrageous he screams and he bawls Jean Genie
Jean Genie let yourself go whoah
Go
Go
The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
Hes outrageous he screams and he bawls Jean Genie
Jean Genie let yourself go whoah
Go go goBorn in a UFO
She was born in a UFO
I come to the glade and watch the saucer land
She glided through the mist in an a-line skirt
Booted her shoes like hooves in the dirt
Her clutch bag reflected the sun and steel
The fiftys movie so many squealed
Theres no direction home she pleads
She cornered me against the trees
I was home I thought my life could start
She was not like the other girls
I was born under a stone
We were born with a single voice
She was born in a UFO
Born in a UFO
My friends sit around at the end of town
With their heads in their hands in the cool twilight air
I can see by their eyes that theyre bitching sore
Id rather be dead than fool around here anymore
She was all courage geometric face
Electric skin plastic and lace
Silver hair trapezoid flanks
I was so in love with her lavender vest
She was not like the other girls
I was born under a stone
We were born with a single voice
She was born in a UFO
Like in outer space
Born in a UFO
She was born in a UFO
Born in a UFO
She was born in a UFOJacqui loves her work and her work is love
For there is no other
She says god has given me a job
Jacqui loves her work
There is no other
Jacquis aiming for the stars but landed on the clouds
There is no other
Sitting in her corner too afraid to run away
Like a slave without chains
The wonder turns to danger spring turns to winter
God bless the girl
But I will treasure treasure every single moment
God bless the girl
Fire turns to water light becomes darkness
God bless the girl
And I dont wanna hurt you just wanna have some fun
God bless the girl
God bless the girl
Yeah I dont wanna hurt you just wanna have some fun
God bless the girl
You dont need another friend you just need a reason
There is no other
Jacqui loves her work and her work is love
For there is no other
The wonder turns to danger spring turns to winter
God bless the girl
But I will always treasure treasure every single moment
God bless the girl
Fire turns to water and light becomes darkness
God bless the girl
I dont wanna hurt you just wanna have some fun
God bless the girl
God bless the girl
God bless the girl God bless the girl
I dont wanna hurt you just wanna have some fun
God bless the girl God bless the girl

Years pass so swiftly
God bless the girl God bless the girl
God bless the girl God bless the girl
God bless the girl God bless the girl
God bless the girl God bless the girlIts the darkest hour youre twenty-two
The voice of youth the hour of dread
Its the darkest hour and your voice is new
Love is lost and lost is love
Your countrys new your friends are new
Your house and even your eyes are new
Your maid is new and your accent too
But your fear is as old as the world
Say goodbye to the thrills of life
When love was good when love was bad
Wave goodbye to the life without pain
Say hello your beautiful girl
Say hello to the greater men
Tell them your secrets theyre like the grave
Oh what have you done oh what have you done
Love is lost lost is love
You know so much its making you cry
You refuse to talk but you think like mad
Youve cut out your zone and the things have fold
Oh what have you done oh what have you done
Oh what have you done oh what have you doneWell dont you worry bout whats been on my mind

Lets spend the night together nowSomething like Tobacco Road
Living on a lonely road
I will pull you out of there
We will go to Finchley Fair
I will buy a feather hat
I will steal a cricket bat
Smash some windows make a noise
We will run with Dirty Boys
When the sun goes down
When the sun goes down and the die is cast
When the die is cast and you have no choice
We will run with Dirty Boys
We all want men we all want you
Me and the boys we all go through
Youve got to learn to hold your tongue
They said the moon was his burning sonCold fire youve got everything but cold fire
You will be my rest and peace child
I moved up to take a place
Near you
So tired its the sky that makes you feel tried
Its a trick to make you see wide
It can all but break your heat
In pieces
Staying back in your memory
Are the movies in the past
How you moved is all it takes
To sing a song of when I loved
The prettiest star
One day though it might as well be someday
You and I will rise up all the way
All because of what you are
The prettiest star
Staying back in your memory
Are the movies in the past
How you moved is all it takes
To sing a song of when I loved
The prettiest star
One day though it might as well be someday
You and I will rise up all the way
All because of what you are
The prettiest starIm just a rock star stabbing away

Mission is dark
Trapped between the rocks
Blocking the waterfall
The songs of dust
The world would end
The night was always falling
The peacock in the snow
And I tell myself
I dont know who I am
And I tell myself
I dont know who I am
My father ran the prison
My father ran the prison
I can only love you
By hating him more
Thats not the truth
Its too big a word
He believed
That love is theft
Love and war
The theft of love
And I tell myself
I dont know who I am
And I tell myself
I dont know who I am
My father ran the prison
My father ran the prison
But I am a seer I am a liar
I am a seer but I am a liar
My father ran the prison
My father ran the prisonINSTRUMENTALValentine told me whos to go
Feelings he treasured most of all
The teachers and the football stars
Its in his tiny face
Its in his scrawny hands
Valentine sold his soul
Hes got something to say
Its Valentines day
The rhythm of the crowd
Benny and Judy down
Valentine sees it all
Hes got something to say
Its Valentines day
Valentine told me how he feels
If all the world were under his heels
Or stumbling through the mall
Its in his tiny face
Its in his scrawny hands
Valentine knows it all
Hes got something to say
Its Valentines day

Its in his icy heart

Oh I can work the scene and
I can see the magazines
I can hear the nation
I can hear the nation cry
You will set the world babe
You will set the world on fire
You will set it on fire
Oh you will set the world babe
You will set the world on fire
I can work the scene and
I can see the magazines
Oh I can hear the nation
I can hear the nation cry
You will set the world babe
You will set the world on fire
You will set it on fireI took the call IAnnotate packed the bag
I ride the train to the pick-up point
Ill be telling myself
There was no other way
That you brought it on yourself
Now my hearts aflame
At the end of your life
Its the end of your life
Ive got a pool of blood
On this bathroom floor
The mirrors broke
Theres a crack in the door
Theres a broken window
That Ill be crawling through
Then Ill change my life
And we wont have you
We wont have you
No we wont have you
Good or evil
Saint or whore
The mythical public
I dont recall
You were on the ledger
Your name was double crossed
You were a prime assignment
So help me Christ
Ive got major questions
About the Lord above
About Satan below
About the way we love
About the rule at the top
And the people coming up
And I still dont know
What we were looking for
But it wasnt you
No it wasnt you
No It wasnt youHe looked a lot like Che Guevara drove a diesel van
Kept his gun in quiet seclusion such a humble man
The only survivor of the National Peoples Gang
Panic in Detroit I asked for an autograph
He wanted to stay home I wish someone would phone
Panic in Detroit
He laughed at accidental sirens that broke the evening gloom
The police had warned of repercussions
They followed none too soon
A trickle of strangers were all that were left alive
Panic in Detroit I asked for an autograph
He wanted to stay home I wish someone would phone
Panic in Detroit
Putting on some clothes I made my way to school
And I found my teacher crouching in his overalls
I screamed and ran to smash my favorite slot machine
And jumped the silent cars that slept at traffic lights
Having scored a trillion dollars made a run back home
Found him slumped across the table a gun and me alone
I ran to the window looked for a plane or two
Panic in Detroit hed left me an autograph
Let me collect dust I wish someone would phone
Panic in Detroit
Panic in Detroit
Panic in DetroitCutting through the water
Hands upon the ghost
To the city of solid iron
Through the kingdom of the boats
Send your friend away now
Let him sail back home tonight
Something like religion
Dancing face to face
Something like a drowning
Dancing out in space
No-one here can see you
Dancing face to face
No-one here can beat you
Dancing out in space
Silent as Georges Rodenbach
Mist and silhouette
Girl you move like water
Youve got stars upon your head
Youve got my name and number
Youve got to take the floor
Something like religion
Dancing face to face
Something like a drowning
Dancing out in space
No-one here can see you
Dancing face to face
No-one here can beat you
Dancing out in space
Dancing face to face
Dancing out in space
Dancing face to face
Dancing out in space
Dancing face to face
Dancing out in spaceTime hes waiting in the wings
He speaks of senseless things
His script is you and me boys
Time he flexes like a whore
Falls wanking to the floor
His trick is you and me boy
Time in quaaludes and red wine
Demanding Billy Dolls
And other friends of mine
Take your time
The sniper in the brain regurgitating drain
Incestuous and vain
And many other last names
Oh well I look at my watch it say nine twenty-five
And I think oh God Im still alive
We should be on by now
We should be on by now
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
You are not a victim
You just scream with boredom
You are not evicting time
Chimes goddamn youre looking old
Youll freeze and catch a cold
Cause youve left your coat behind
Take your time
Breaking up is hard but keeping dark is hateful
I had so many dreams
I had so many breakthroughs
But you my love were kind but love has left you dreamless
The door to dreams was closed
Your park was real dreamless
Perhaps youre smiling now
Smiling through this darkness
But all I had to give was guilt for dreaming
We should be on by now
We should be on by now
We should be on by now
We should be on by now
We should be on by now
La la la la la la la la

Who suffers gloom
So slow
Eyes were stolen
For her
A sleeping sky
Takes the moon
So slow
I would slide away
Further out to sea
Further out to sea
So she
She saw me smile
Feeling like
Id never been
She saw me smile
Feeling like Id never been
In love
Feeling like Id never been
The only one and all alone
The only one and all aloneIts safe in the city to love in a doorway
To wrangle some screens from the door
And isnt it me putting pain in a stranger
Like a portrait in flesh who trails on a leash
Will you see that Im scared and Im lonely
So Ill break up my room and yawn and I
Run to the center of things
Where the knowing one says
Chorus
Boys boys its a sweet thing
Boys boys its a sweet thing sweet thing
If you want it boys get it here thing
Cause hope boys is a cheap thing cheap
Thing
Im glad that youre older than me
Makes me feel important and free
Does that make you smile isnt that me
Im in your way and Ill steal every moment
If his trade is a curse then Ill bless you
And turn to the crossroads and hamburgers and

ChorusDont talk of dust and roses
Or should we powder our noses
Dont live for last years capers
Give me steel give me steel give me pulses unreal
Hell build a glass asylum
With just a hint of mayhem
Hell build a better whirlpool
Well be living from sin then we can really begin
Please savior savior show us
Hear me Im graphically yours
Someone to claim us someone to follow
Someone to shame us some brave Apollo
Someone to fool us someone like you
We want you Big Brother Big Brother
I know you think youre awful square
But you made everyone and youve been every where

As the last few corpses lay rotting on the slimy
Thoroughfare
The shutters lifted in inches in Temperance Building
High on Poachers Hill
And red mutant eyes gaze down on Hunger City
No more big wheels
Fleas the size of rats sucked on rats the size of cats
And ten thousand peoploids split into small tribes
Coveting the highest of the sterile skyscrapers
Like packs of dogs assaulting the glass fronts of Love-Me Avenue
Ripping and rewrapping mink and shiny silver fox now leg-warmers
Family badge of sapphire and cracked emerald
Any day now
The year of the Diamond Dogs

As they pulled you out of the oxygen tent
You asked for the latest party
With your silicone hump and your ten inch stump
Dressed like a priest you was
Todd Brownings freak you was
Crawling down the alley on your hands and knee
Im sure youre not protected for its plain to see
The diamond dogs are poachers and they hide behind trees
Hunt you to the ground they will mannequins with kill appeal
Will they come
Ill keep a friend serene
Will they come
Oh baby come unto me
Will they come
Well shes come been and gone
Come out of the garden baby
Youll catch your death in the fog
Young girl they call them the Diamond Dogs
Young girl they call them the Diamond Dogs
The Halloween Jack is a real cool cat
And he lives on top of Manhattan Chase
The elevators broke so he slides down a rope
Onto the street below oh Tarzie go man go
Meet his little hussy with his ghost town approach
Her face is sans feature but she wears a Dali brooch
Sweetly reminiscent something mother used to bake
Wrecked up and paralyzed Diamond Dogs are stabilized
Will they come
Ill keep a friend serene
Will they come
Oh baby come unto me
Will they come
Well shes come been and gone
Come out of the garden baby
Youll catch your death in the fog
Young girl they call them the Diamond Dogs
Young girl they call them the Diamond Dogs
Oo-oo-ooh call them the Diamond Dogs
Oo-oo-ooh call them the Diamond Dogs
In the year of the scavenger the season of the bitch
Sashay on the boardwalk scurry to the ditch
Just another future song lonely little kitsch
Theres gonna be sorrow try and wake up tomorrow
Will they come
Ill keep a friend serene
Will they come
Oh baby come unto me
Will they come
Well shes come been and gone
Come out of the garden baby
Youll catch your death in the fog
Young girl they call them the Diamond Dogs
Young girl they call them the Diamond Dogs

Keep cool
Diamond Dogs rule ok
Hey-hey-hey-hey
Beware of the Diamond Dogs
Beware of the Diamond Dogs
Beware of the Diamond DogsIll make you a deal like any other candidate
Well pretend were walking home cause your futures at stake
My set is amazing it even smells like a street
Theres a bar at the end
Where I can meet you and your friend
Someone scrawled on the wall I smell the blood of les tricoteuses
Who wrote up scandals in other bars
Im having so much fun with the poisonous people
Spreading rumors and lies and stories they made up
Some make you sing and some make you scream
One makes you wish that youd never been seen
But theres a shop on the corner thats selling papier mache
Making bullet-proof faces Charlie Manson Cassius Clay
If you want it boys get it here thing
So you scream out of line
I want you I need you Anyone out there Any time
Tres butch little number whines Hey dirty I want you
When its good its really good and when its bad I go to pieces
If you want it boys get it here thing
Well on the street where you live I could not hold up my head
For I put all I have in another bed
On another floor in the back of a car
In the cellar like a church with the door ajar
Well I guess weve must be looking for a different kind
But we cant stop trying till we break up our minds
Til the sun drips blood on the seedy young knights
Who press you on the ground while shaking in fright
I guess we could cruise down one more time
With you by my side it should be fine
Well buy some drugs and watch a band
Then jump in the river holding handsYou always were the one that knew
They sold us for the likes of you
I always wanted new surroundings
A room to rent while the lizards lay crying in the heat
Trying to remember who to meet
I would take a foxy kind of stand
While tens of thousands found me in demand
CHORUS
When you rock n roll with me
No one else Id rather be
Nobody here can do it for me
Im in tears again
When you rock n roll with me
Gentle hearts are counted down
The queue is out of sight and out of sounds
Me Im out of breath but not quite doubting
Ive found a door which lets me outSomething kind of hit me today
I looked at you and wondered if you saw things my way
People will hold us to blame
It hit me today it hit me today
Were taking it hard all the time
Why dont we pass it by
Just reply youve changed your mind
Were fighting with the eyes of the blind
Taking it hard taking it hard
Yet now
We feel that we are paper choking on you nightly
They tell me Son we want you be elusive but dont walk far
For were breaking in the new boys deceive your next of kin
For youre dancing where the dogs decay defecating ecstasy
Youre just an ally of the leecher
Locator for the virgin King but I love you in your fuck-me pumps
And your nimble dress that trails
Oh dress yourself my urchin one for I hear them on the rails
Because of all weve seen because of all weve said
We are the dead
One thing kind of touched me today
I looked at you and counted all the times we had laid
Pressing our love through the night
Knowing its right knowing its right
Now Im hoping some one will care
Living on the breath of a hope to be shared
Trusting on the sons of our love
That someone will care someone will care
But now
Were todays scrambled creatures locked in tomorrows double feature
Heavens on the pillow its silence competes with hell
Its a twenty-four hour service guaranteed to make you tell
And the streets are full of press men
Bent on getting hung and buried
And the legendary curtains are drawn round Baby Bankrupt
Who sucks you while youre sleeping
Its the theater of financiers
Count them fifty round a table
White and dressed to kill
Oh caress yourself my juicy
For my hands have all but withered
Oh dress yourself my urchin one for I hear them on the stairs
Because of all weve seen because of all weve said
We are the dead
We are the dead
We are the deadHey it aint over
Me I hope that Im crazy
I feel you driving and youre only the wheel
Slow down let someone love you
Oh Ive never touched you since I started to feel
If theres nothing to hide me
Then youve never seen me hanging naked and wired
Somebody lied I say its hip
To be alive
Now your smile is spreading thin
Seems youre trying not to lose
Since Im not supposed to win
All youve got to do is win
Thats all you gotta do ooh it aint over
Me Im fresh on your pages
Secret thinker sometimes listening aloud
Life lies dumb on its heroes
Wear your wound with honor make someone proud
Someone like you should not be allowed
To start any fires
Now your smile is spreading thin
Seems youre trying not to lose
Since Im not supposed to win
All youve got to do is win
Thats all you gotta do ooh it aint over
Now your smile is spreading thin
Seems youre trying not to lose
Since Im not supposed to win
All youve got to do is win
Thats all you gotta do all you got to do is win
Now your smile is spreading thin seek and believe in you

They slither wildly as they slip away across the universe
Pools of sorrow waves of joy
Are drifting through my opened mind
Possessing and caressing me
Nothings gonna change my world
Nothings gonna change my world
Nothings gonna change my world
Nothings gonna change my world
Images of broken light
Which dance before me like a million eyes
They call me on and on across the universe
Thoughts meander like a restless wind inside a letter box
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe
Nothings gonna change my world
Nothings gonna change my world
Nothings gonna change my world
Nothings gonna change my world
Sounds of laughter shades of life
Are ringing through my opened ears
Inciting and inviting me
Limitless undying love
Which shines around me like a million suns
It calls me on and on across the universe
Nothings gonna change my world
Nothings gonna change my world
Nothings gonna change my world
Nothings gonna change my world
Nothings gonna change my world

She took his ring took his babies
It took him minutes took her nowhere
Heaven knows shed have taken anything but
All night
She wants the young American
Young American young American she wants the young American
All right

Scanning life through the picture window
She finds the slinky vagabond
He coughs as he passes her Ford Mustang but
Heaven forbid shell take anything
But the freak and his type all for nothing
Misses a step and cuts his hand but
Showing nothing he swoops like a song
She cries where have all Papas heroes gone
All night
She wants a young American
Young American young American she wants the young American

For even yesterday
Have you have been an un-American
Just you and your idol singing falsetto bout
Leather leather everywhere and
Not a myth left from the ghetto
Well well well would you carry a razor
In case just in case of depression
Sit on your hands on a bus of survivors
Blushing at all the afro-Sheilas

As long as were together
The rest can go to hell
I absolutely love you
But were absolute beginners
With eyes completely open
But nervous all the same
If our love song
Could fly over mountains
Could laugh at the ocean
Just like the films
Theres no reason
To feel all the hard times
To lay down the hard lines
Its absolutely true
Nothing much could happen
Nothing we cant shake
Oh were absolute beginners
With nothing much at stake
As long as youre still smiling
Theres nothing more I need
I absolutely love you
But were absolute beginners
But if my love is your love
Were certain to succeed
If our love song
Could fly over mountains
Sail over heartaches
Just like the films
If theres reason
To feel all the hard times
To lay down the hard lines
Its absolutely trueWell Annies pretty neat she always eats her meat

You pull on your finger then another finger then your cigarette
The wall to wall is calling it lingers then you forget
Ohhh youre a rock n roll suicide

And the clock waits so patiently on your song
You walk past a cafe but you dont eat when youve lived too long
Oh no no no youre a rock n roll suicide
Chev brakes are snarling as you stumble across the road
But the day breaks instead so you hurry home
Dont let the sun blast your shadow
Dont let the milk float ride your mind
Youre so natural religiously unkind

Youre watching yourself but youre too unfair
You got your head all tangled up
But if I could only make you care
Oh no love Youre not alone

Velvet GoldmineOnce she had drowned and started her slow descent
Down the streams to where the great rivers broaden
Oh the open sky chant most magnificent
As if it was acting as her bodys guardian
Wreck and duck weed slowly increased her weight
By clasping her in their slimy grip
Through her limbs the cold blooded fishes played
Creatures and plant life kept on thus obstructing her last trip
And the sky that same evening grew dark as smoke
And its stars through the night kept the brightness still soaring
But it quickly grew clear when dawn now broke
To see that she got one further morning
Once her pallid trunk had rotted beyond repair
It happened quite slowly that she gently slipped from Gods thoughts
First with her face then her hands right at the last with her hair
Leaving those corpse-choked rivers just one more corpseYoure like a sailor with a girl on every shore
Stay with them now for they wont see you any more
Like a gypsy forever on the run
Stay for a while while ya look for a whore
Like that sailor leaves come back again
Stay for a while and they wont see you again
Like that gypsy caravan forever on the run
Ya stay for a while then you pick up and go
Thats how you show
Your love for me
Thats how you show
Your love for me
Youre like
Here today
Gone tomorrow
Each time you call
You leave a little sorrow
Youre like
Here today
Gone tomorrow
Each time you call
You leave a little sorrow
Youre like
Youre like that big big star hes tore the town apart
Givin everyone to console their aching heart
Like that snow that fell looks so wrong and out of place
Stay for a while then you leave without a trace
Thats xactly like that star he tore the town apart
Leave everyone to console their aching heart
Like that snow that fell looks so wrong and out of place
Stay for a while leave without a trace
Thats how you show
Your love for me
Thats how you show
Your love for me
Youre like

Thank youThis is not America
Shala la la la
A little piece of you
The little peace in me
Will die
For this is not America
Blossom fails to bloom this season
Promise not to stare
Too long
For this is not a miracle
There was a time
A storm that blew so pure
For this could be the biggest sky
And I could have the faintest idea
For this is not America
This is not America
This is not
Snowman melting from the inside
Falcon spirals
To the ground
So bloody red tomorrows clouds
A little piece of you
The little piece in me
Will die
For this is not America
There was a time
A wind that blew so young
For this could be the biggest sky
And I could have the faintest idea
For this is not America
This is not America
This is not
This is not America
This is not
This is not America
This is notAh ah ah ah

I can stare for a thousand years
Colder than the moon

And Ive been putting out the fire with gasoline
See these eyes so red
Red like jungle burning bright
Those who feel me near
Pull the blinds and change their minds
Its been so long
Still this pulsing night
A plague I call a heartbeat
Just be still with me
But it wouldnt believe what Ive been through
Youve been so long
Well its been so long
Ive been putting out the fire with gasoline
Putting out the fire
With gasoline
See these tears so blue
An ageless heart that can never mend
Tears can never dry
A judgment made can never bend

Just be still with me
You wouldnt believe what Ive been through

Made in a bar at the railway station
And theres a story a kind of fable
On a card at the corner table
On it is a message been there some time
It starts of The coffee tasted so fine
It says One day this may find you
These few words may remind you
We sat here together just to pass time
You said how the coffee tasted so fine
It goes on to say I love you
If you should find this I must hear from you
It gives a number but the name has faded away
All that is left are just the words Maybe someday
Thats the story and the fable
Never leave alone from a corner table

Pressure pushing down on me
Pressing down on you no man ask for
Under pressure that brings a building down
Splits a family in two
Puts people on streets
Um ba ba be
Um ba ba be
De day da
Ee day da thats okay
Its the terror of knowing
What the world is about
Watching some good friends
Screaming Let me out
Pray tomorrow gets me higher
Pressure on people people on streets

Pressure on people people on streets
Turned away from it all like a blind man
Sat on a fence but it dont work
Keep coming up with love but its so slashed and torn
Why why why
Love love love love love
Insanity laughs under pressure were breaking
Cant we give ourselves one more chance
Why cant we give love that one more chance
Why cant we give love give love give love give love
Give love give love give love give love give love
Cause loves such an old fashioned word
And love dares you to care for
The people on the People on streets edge of the night
And loves People on streets dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves
This is our last dance
This is ourselves
Under pressure

Oh oh oh little China girl
I could escape this feeling with my China girl
I feel a wreck without my little China girl
I hear her heart beating loud as thunder
Saw they stars crashing
Im a mess without my little China girl
Wake up mornings wheres my little China girl
I hear her hearts beating loud as thunder
Saw they stars crashing down
I feel a-tragic like Im Marlon Brando
When I look at my China girl
I could pretend that nothing really meant too much
When I look at my China girl
I stumble into town just like a sacred cow
Visions of swastikas in my head
Plans for everyone
Its in the whites of my eyes
My little China girl
You shouldnt mess with me
Ill ruin everything you are
You know Ill give you television
Ill give you eyes of blue
Ill give you mens who want to rule the world
And when I get excited
My little China girl says
Oh baby just you shut your mouth
She says sh-sh-shhh
She says sh-sh-shhh

Just wishing that I had just something you wore
I put it on when I go lonely
Will you take off your dress and send it to me
I miss your kissin and I miss your head
And a letter in your writing doesnt mean youre not dead
Run outside in the desert heat
Make your dress all wet and send it to me
I miss your soup and I miss your bread
And a letter in your writing doesnt mean youre not dead
So spill your breakfast and drip your wine
Just wear that dress when youre die
D-A-V-I-D
Sitting here wishing on a cement floor
Just wishing that I had just something you wore
Bloody your hands on a cactus tree
Wipe it on your dress and send it to me
Sitting here wishing on a cement floor
Just wishing that I had just something you woreFor were living in a safety zone
Dont be holding back from me
Were living from hour to hour down here
And well take it when we can
Its a kind of living which recognizes
The death of the odourless man
When nothing is vanity nothings too slow
Its not Eden but its no sham
There is no hell
There is no shame
There is no hell
Like an old hell
There is no hell
And its lights up boys
Lights up boys
Explosion falls upon deaf ears
While were swimming in a sea of sham
Living in the shadow of vanity
A complex fashion for a simple man
And there is no hell
And there is no shame
And there is no hell
Like an old hell
There is no hell
And the silence flies on its brief flight
A razor sharp crap shoot affair
And we light up our lives
And theres no more of me exploding you
Re-exposing you
Like everybody do
Re-exploding you
I dont know what to use
Make somebody move
Me exploding
Me exploding youNothing remains
We could run
When the rain slows
Look for the cars or signs of life
Where the heat goes
Look for the drifters
We should crawl under the bracken
Look for the shafts of light on the road
Where the heat goes
Everything has changed
For in truth its the beginning of nothing
And nothing has changed
Everything has changed
For in truth its the beginning of an end
And nothing has changed
And everything has changed
In your fear
Of what we have become
Take to the fire
Now we must burn
All that we are
Rise together
Through these clouds
As on wings
In your fear seek only peace
In you fear seek only love
In your fear seek only peace
In you fear seek only love
In your fear in your fear
As on wings
This is the trip
And this is the business we take
This is our number
All my trials Lord
Will be remembered
Everything has changedCalling Sister Midnight
Youve got me reaching for the moon
Calling Sister Midnight
Youve got me playing the fool
Calling Sister Midnight
Calling Sister Midnight
Can you hear me call
Can you hear me well
Can you hear me at all
Calling Sister Midnight
Im an Idiot for you
Calling Sister Midnight
Im a breakage inside
Calling Sister Midnight
Calling Sister Midnight
You know I had a dream last night
Mother was in my bed
And I made love to her
Father he gunned for me
Hunted me with his six gun
Calling Sister Midnight
What can I do about my dreams
Listen to me Sister Midnight
You put a beggar in my heart
Calling Sister Midnight
Youve got me walking in rags
Hey where are you Sister Midnight
Can you hear me call
Can you hear me well
Can you hear me at allMy my the time do fly
When its in another pair of hands
And a loser I will be
For Ive never been a winner in my life
I got used to stressing pain
I used the sucker pills to pity for the self
Oh its the animal in me
But Id rather be a beggarman on the shelf
Dont be so forlorn its just the payoff
Its the rain before the storm
On a better day Ill take you by the hand
And Ill walk you through the doors
Dont be so forlorn its just the payoff
Its the rain before the storm
Dont you let my letter get you down
Dont you dont you dont you dont you
My my but time do fly
When its in another pair of pants
And illusion I will be
For Ive never been a sinner la di da
Dont be so forlorn its just the payoff
Its the rain before the storm
Dont you let my letter get you down
Dont you dont you dont you dont you
Dont you let my letter get you down down down down
Dont you dont you dont you dont you
Dont you let my letter get you down down down down
Dont you dont you dont you dont you
Down down down down down down
Down down down down down down
Down down down down down downI wish I was smarter
I got so lost on the shore
I wish I was taller
Things really matter to me
But I put my face in tomorrow
I believe were not alone
I believe in Beatles
I believe my little soul has grown
And Im still so afraid
Yes Im still so afraid
Yea Im still so afraid on my own
On my own
What made my life so wonderful
What made me feel so bad
I used to wake up the ocean
I used to walk on clouds
If I put faith in medication
If I can smile a crooked smile
If I can talk on television
If I can walk an empty mile
Then I wont feel afraid
No I wont feel afraid
I wont be Be afraid
Anymore
Anymore
AnymoreBaby I dream between the blade and the tongue
Of the rose on your cheek the wounded and dumb
We stumble and fall we stumble and fall
Skin on skin but theres heaven in
Heavens in here
Heavens in here
Among the twilight and stars
Like a rocket to Mars
Heaven in here
The first and the last are telling it all
Telling you loud but selling it small
Im taking a swing at this shadow of mine
Crucifix hangs and my hearts in my mouth but its here
Heavens in here
Heavens in here
Among the twilight and stars
Like a rocket to Mars
Heaven in here
Heaven in one sigh heaven in two eyes
Heaven lies between your marbled thighs
The rustle of your falling gown
We stumble and fall like tragedy falls
We stumble and twirl theres heaven in here
We stumble and fall uncertain we fall
Flesh on flesh but theres heaven in
Heavens in here
Heavens in here
Heavens in here
Among the twilight and stars
Like a rocket to Mars
Heaven in here
Youll dance to my tongue
Well dance on the sun
Were the twilight and stars
Theres heaven in hereHallo Spaceboy youre sleepy now second time Hallo
Your silhouette is so stationary
Youre released but your custody calls
And I want to be free
Dont you want to be free
Do you like girls or boys
Its confusing these days
But Moondust will cover you
Cover you
This chaos is killing me
Chorus
So bye bye love
Yeah bye bye love
Bye bye love
Yeah bye bye love
This chaos is killing me
And the chaos is calling me
Yeah bye bye love
Chorus
This chaos is killing me
This chaos is killing me
Yeah bye bye love
Bye bye love
Good time love
Be sweet sweet dove
Bye bye spaceboy
Bye bye love
Moondust will cover youOogie waits for just another day
Drags his bones
To see the Yankees play
Bones Boy talks and flickers gray
Oh they slip away
Once a time
They nearly might have been
Bones and Oogie on a silver screen
No one knew what they could do
Except for me and you
They slip away
They slip away
Dont forget
To keep your head warm
Twinkle twinkle Uncle Floyd
Watching all the world
And war torn
How I wonder where you are
Oo-o
Sailing over
Coney Island
Twinkle twinkle Uncle Floyd
We were dumb
But you were fun boy
How I wonder where you are
Oo-o
Oogie knew theres never ever time
Some of us will always stay behind
Down in space its always one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-two
The joke we always knew
Oo-oo
Whatsa matter with you
Cmon lets go
Slip away
Oo-oEmily tries but misunderstands
Shes often inclined to borrow somebodys dreams till tomorrow
There is no other day
Lets try it another way
Youll lose your mind and play
Free games for May
See Emily play
Soon after dark Emily cries
Gazing at trees in sorrow hardly a sound till tomorrow
There is no other day
Lets try it another way
Youll lose your mind and play
Free games for May
See Emily play
Put on a gown that touches the ground
Float on a river for ever and ever
Emily
There is no other day
Lets try it another way
Youll lose your mind and play
Free games for May
See Emily playNew feeling inside
Its a hot certain kind
I feel hot and cold
Down my soul baby
I cant explain
Going out of my mind
Dizzy in the head and Im feeling blue
Things you say well maybe theyre true
I get funny dreams again and again
Knows what it means but
Cant explain
I think its love
Say it to you
When I feel blue
I cant explain no I cant explain
You know I cant explain
Im going out of my mind
Well Im a worried guy
But I cant explainHe looked a lot like Che Guevara drove a diesel van
Kept his gun in quiet seclusion such a humble man
The only survivor of the National Peoples Gang
Panic in Detroit I asked for an autograph
He wanted to stay home I wish someone would phone
Panic in Detroit
He laughed at accidental sirens that broke the evening gloom
The police had warned of repercussions
They followed none too soon
A trickle of strangers were all that were left alive
Panic in Detroit I asked for an autograph
He wanted to stay home I wish someone would phone
Panic in Detroit
Putting on some clothes I made my way to school
And I found my teacher crouching in his overalls
I screamed and ran to smash my favorite slot machine
And jumped the silent cars that slept at traffic lights
Having scored a trillion dollars made a run back home
Found him slumped across the table a gun and me alone
I ran to the window looked for a plane or two
Panic in Detroit hed left me an autograph
Let me collect dust I wish someone would phone
Panic in Detroit
Panic in Detroit
Panic in DetroitCold fire youve got everything but cold fire
You will be my rest and peace child
I moved up to take a place
Near you
So tired its the sky that makes you feel tried
Its a trick to make you see wide
It can all but break your heat
In pieces
Staying back in your memory
Are the movies in the past
How you moved is all it takes
To sing a song of when I loved
The prettiest star
One day though it might as well be someday
You and I will rise up all the way
All because of what you are
The prettiest star
Staying back in your memory
Are the movies in the past
How you moved is all it takes
To sing a song of when I loved
The prettiest star
One day though it might as well be someday
You and I will rise up all the way
All because of what you are
The prettiest starUh uh ah Let me put my arms around your head
Dom do ah Gee its hot lets go to bed
Dont forget to turn on the light
Dont laugh babe itll be alright
Dom do ah Pour me out another phone
Dom do ah Ill ring and see if your friends are home
Perhaps the strange ones in the dome

And try to get it on like once before
When people stared in Jaggers eyes and scored

Neither hands nor limbs would burst
Its hard enough to keep formation with this fall out saturation
Bah dom bah cursing at the astronette
Dom do ah who stands in steel by his cabinet

The bureau supply for aging men
With snorting head he gazes to the shore
Once had raised a sea that raged no more

And never tried to see
Wondering if Id done wrong
Will this depression last for long
CHORUS
Wont you tell me
Where have all the good times gone
Where have all the good times gone

Once we had an easy ride
And always felt the same
Time was on our side
And I had everything to gain
Let it be like yesterday
Please let me have happy days
Ma and Pa looked back on all the things they used to do
Didnt have no money and they always told the truth
Daddy didnt have no toys
And Mummy didnt need no boys
CHORUS
Yesterday was such an easy game for you to play
But lets face it things are so much easier today
Guess you need some bringing down
Get your feet back on the ground
CHORUSOhhhhhhere it comes
Here comes the night
Yeah here comes the night
Oh yeah here comes the night
I can see right out my window walking down the street my girl
With another guy
His arms around her like it used to be with me
Oh it makes me want to die
Yeah here it comes
Here comes the night
Yeah here comes the night here comes the night
Yeahhere comes the night
There they go funny how they look so good together
Wonder what is wrong with me
Why cant I accept the fact shes chosen him
And simply let them be
Here it comes
Here comes the night

Yeahhere comes the night
Oh shes with him theyre turning down the lights
Now hes holding her the way I used to do

Exactly like she told me too

You caught yourself a trick down
On Sunset and Vine
But since he pinned you baby
Youre a porcupine
You sold me illusions for a sack full of checks
Youve made a bad connection cause I just want your sexShapes of things before my eyes
Just teach me to despise
Will time make man more wise
Here within my lonely frame
My eyes just hurt my brain
But will it seem the same
Chorus
Come tomorrow will I be older
Come tomorrow maybe a soldier
Come tomorrow may I be bolder than today
Now the trees are almost green
But will they still be seen
When time and tide have been
Boy into your passing hands

Dont make them desert sands
ChorusWith your long blond hair and your eyes of blue
The only thing I ever got from you
Was sorrow sorrow

He speaks of senseless things
His script is you and me boys
Time he flexes like a whore
Falls wanking to the floor
His trick is you and me boy
Time in quaaludes and red wine
Demanding Billy Dolls
And other friends of mine
Take your time
The sniper in the brain regurgitating drain
Incestuous and vain
And many other last names
Oh well I look at my watch it say nine twenty-five
And I think oh God Im still alive
We should be on by now
We should be on by now
La la la la la la la la

You are not a victim
You just scream with boredom
You are not evicting time
Chimes goddamn youre looking old
Youll freeze and catch a cold
Cause youve left your coat behind
Take your time
Breaking up is hard but keeping dark is hateful
I had so many dreams
I had so many breakthroughs
But you my love were kind but love has left you dreamless
The door to dreams was closed
Your park was real dreamless
Perhaps youre smiling now
Smiling through this darkness
But all I had to give was guilt for dreaming
We should be on by now
We should be on by now
We should be on by now
We should be on by now
We should be on by now

Shell lay belief on you
Skin sweet with musky oil
The lady from another grinning soul
Cologne shell wear
Silver and Americard
Shell drive a beetle car
And beat you down at cool Canasta
And when the clothes are strewn
Dont be afraid of the room
Touch the fullness of her breast
Feel the love of her caress
She will be your living end
Shell come shell go
Shell lay belief on you
But she wont stake her life on you
How can life become her point of view
And when the clothes are strewn
Dont be afraid of the room
Touch the fullness of her breast
Feel the love of her caress
She will be your living end
She will be your living end
She will be your living end
She will be your living end
She will be your livingHey Rosalyn tell me where youve been

Rosalyn
Yeah Rosalyn Rosalyn Rosalyn Rosalyn ooh-yeah ahShaky threw a party that lasted all night
Everybody drank a lot of something nice
There was an old fashioned band of married men
Looking up to me for encouragement it was so-so
The ladies looked bad but the music was sad
No one took their eyes off Lorraine
She shimmered and she strolled like a Chicago moll
Her feathers looked better and better it was so-so
Yeah it was time to unfreeze
When the reverend alabaster danced on his knees
Slam so it wasnt a game
Cracking all the mirrors in shame
Watch that man oh honey watch that man
He talks like a jerk but he could eat you with a fork and spoon
Watch that man oh honey watch that man
He walks like a jerk
But hes only taking care of the room
Must be in tune
A Benny Goodman fan painted holes in his hands
So shaky hung him up to dry
The pundits were hoking the manholes were smoking
And every bottle battled with the reason why
The girl on the phone wouldnt leave me alone
A throw back from someones LP
A lemon in a bag played the tiger rag
And the bodies on the screen stopped bleeding
Yeah I was shaking like a leaf
For I couldnt understand the conversation
Yeah I ran to the street looking for information
Watch that man oh honey watch that man
He talks like a jerk but he could eat you with a fork and spoon
Watch that man oh honey watch that man
He walks like a jerk
But hes only taking care of the room
Must be in tuneI can go anyway way I choose
I can live anyhow win or lose
I can go anywhere for something new
Anyway anyhow anywhere I choose
I can do anything right or wrong
I can talk anyhow and get along
I dont care anyway I never lose
Anyway anyhow anywhere I choose
Nothing gets in my way
Not even locked doors
Dont follow the lines that been laid before
I get along anyway I care
Anyway anyhow anywhere
I can go anyway way I choose
I can live anyhow win or lose
I can go anywhere for something new
Anyway anyhow anywhere I chooseMonday mornin feels so bad
Evrybody seems to nag me

Gonna have fun in the city
Be with my girl shes so pretty
She looks fine tonight
She is out of sight to me
Tonight Ill spend my bread tonight

Do the five day grind once more

Cause Ill have Friday on my mind
Gonna have fun in the city
Be with my girl shes so pretty
She looks fine tonight
She is out of sight to me
Tonight Ill spend my bread tonight
Ill lose my head tonight
Ive got to get to night
Monday Ill have Friday on my mindA small Jean Genie snuck off to the city
Strung out on lasers and slash-back blazers
Ate all your razors while pulling the waiters
Talking bout Monroe and walking on Snow White
New Yorks a go-go and everything tastes right
Poor little Greenie ooh-ooh
Keep her comin
The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
Hes outrageous he screams and he bawls Jean Genie
Jean Genie let yourself go whoah
Sits like a man but he smiles like a reptile
She love him she love him but just for a short while
Shell scratch in the sand wont let go his hand
He says hes a beautician and sells you nutrition
And keeps all your dead hair for making up underwear
Poor little Greenie ooh-ooh
The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
Hes outrageous he screams and he bawls Jean Genie
Jean Genie let yourself go whoah
Hes so simple-minded he cant drive his module
He bites on the neon and sleeps in a capsule
Loves to be loved loves to be loved
Oh Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
Hes outrageous he screams and he bawls Jean Genie
Jean Genie let yourself go whoah
Go
Go
The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
Hes outrageous he screams and he bawls Jean Genie
Jean Genie let yourself go whoah
Go go goIm on my own nowhere to roam
I tell you baby dont want no home
I wander round feet off the ground
I even go from town to town
I said I think this rock is grand
Say Ill be your man
Dont bring me down dont bring me down
I met this chick the other day
And then to me she said shell stay
I get this pad just like a cave
And then well have our living made
And then Ill lead her on the ground
My head is spinning round
Dont bring me down dont bring me down
I I I I I need a lover cause someone new
And then to her I will be true
Ill buy her furs and pretty things
Ill even buy a wedding ring
But until then Ill settle down
Say Ill be your man
Dont bring me down dont bring me down
Until then Ill settle down
Say Ill be your man
Dont bring me down dont bring me down
Dont bring me downThe ghost of Manhattoes

Goodbye Mr Ed Andys skull enshrined
In a shopping mall near Queens
Someone sees it all
Icarus takes his pratfall
Bruegel on his head
Goodbye Mr Ed

Some of them are blind
Someone sees it all
Tolerance of violence
By the fellows with no heads

They make no sense
Histories so small
People are so dense

From the spics and blacks and the gum you chew
Where the posters are torn by the muggin gangs
By the faggy parks and the burnt out vans
Ive got ninety-nine years of laying in the dark and Im far too young to lie
Ive got ninety-nine ways to play my guitar its going to pay me before I die
CHORUS
So bob your sweet head
Brother Ziggy going to play
Im just about the best you can hear
Gonna rock it in your head
Shazam and come ball
With my guitar and me soprano
We can give you sweet head
Im tough as glass and clean as night
Well if looks can love we can love all right
Im your rubber peacock angelic whore
Im a wrought iron face upon the wall
I had ninety-nine years of murder called life and Im running away from it all
I got a bedroom every mirror in town theyre going to claim me if I fall
CHORUS
Sweet head give you sweet head
spoken while ya down there
See my eyes of blocked emotion see my tremble see my fall
Traumatics thick and fast your faith in me can last
Besides Im known to lay you one and all
Look south the way your mother dwells
If she knew whats going down shed give you hell
Im the kind of man she warned me of
Till there was rock you only had god
You and I have a mutual vow
We both like young and we both like loud
I got pretty shoes and Im kid and proud
Im street side out with my ear to the crowd

They kiss come and they go
Like breeze brushing my cheek
Like pain like the tears on my face
Girls they come and they go
Like spirits they vanish at dawn
My heart suspended in time
Like you vanish like tears in the rain
Girls they take their loves away
Like spirits living so far away
Girls pretending to break down and cry
Girls whispering wind
What are they giving away
We used to be so happy
Remember remember so happy
I never knew how lonely
How lonely how lonely I could feel
Girls they come and they go
They kiss they come and they go
Like spirits brushing my cheek
Like pain like the tears on my face
Girls they take their loves away
Like spirits living so far away
Girls pretending to break down and cry
Girls whispering wind
What are they giving away
We used to be so happy
Remember remember so happy
I never knew how lonely
How lonely how lonely I could feel
GirlsRamona is so cold
When she broke it off with Leon
She said The ring is enough
I dont wanna see his face again
Ramona was so coldWhat to do
What to say
What to wear on a sunny day
Who to phone
Who to fight
Who to dance with on a Sunday night
Reaching the very edge you know
Reaching the very edge
Going to the other side this time
Reaching the very edge
CHORUS
Youre still breathing but you dont know why
Lifes a bit and sometimes you die
Youre still breathing but you just cant tell
Dont hold your breath but the pretty things are going to hell
I am a drug
I am a dragon
I am the best jazz youve ever seen
I am a dragon
I am the sky
I am the blood at the corner of your eye
I found the secrets I found gold
I find you out before you grow old
I find you out before you grow old
What is eternal
What is damned
What is clay and what is sand
Who to dis
Who to truss
Who to listen to
Who to suss
Im reaching the very edge you know
Im reaching the very edge
Im going to the other side this time
Im reaching the very edge
CHORUS
I am a dragon
I am a drug
I am the best jazz youve ever heard
I am a dragon
I am the sky
I am the blood at the corner of your eye
I found the secrets I found gold
I find you out before you grow old
I find you out before you grow old
REPEAT fourx
The pretty things are going to hell
They wore it out but they wore it well
Youre still breathing but you dont know why
Youre still breathing but you just cant tell
Dont hold your breath but the pretty things are going to hellThe hand that wrote this letter
Sweeps the pillow clean
So rest your head and read a treasured dream
I care for no one else but you
I tear my soul to cease the pain
I think maybe you feel the same
What can we do
Im not quite sure what were supposed to do
So Ive been writing just for you
They say your life is going very well
They say you sparkle like a different girl
But something tells me that you hide
When all the world is warm and tired
You cry a little in the dark
Well so do I

Johnny plays the sitar hes an existentialist
Once he had a name now he plays our game
You wont feel so good now that youve joined the gang
Molly is the model in the ads
Crazy clothes and acid full of soul and crazy hip
Someone switched her on then her beam went wrong
Cause she cant switch off now that shes joined the gang
Arthur is a singer with a band
Arthur drinks two bottles just before he goes on stage
Look at Arthur rave all the kids are paid
They want to see the croaking man who joined the gang
You wont be alone weve all got beery grins
Its a big illusion but at least youre in
At least youre in
This clubs called The Webb its this months pick
Next month we shall find a place where prices arent so stiff
fifteen bob a coke fraid thats past a joke
This is how to spend now that youve joined the gang
This is what to do now that youre here
Sit round doing nothing all together very fast
Psychedelic stars throwing down cigars
Theyre picking up the joints now that theyve joined the gangShaky threw a party that lasted all night
Everybody drank a lot of something nice
There was an old fashioned band of married men
Looking up to me for encouragement it was so-so
The ladies looked bad but the music was sad
No one took their eyes off Lorraine
She shimmered and she strolled like a Chicago moll
Her feathers looked better and better it was so-so
Yeah it was time to unfreeze
When the reverend alabaster danced on his knees
Slam so it wasnt a game
Cracking all the mirrors in shame
Watch that man oh honey watch that man
He talks like a jerk but he could eat you with a fork and spoon
Watch that man oh honey watch that man
He walks like a jerk
But hes only taking care of the room
Must be in tune
A Benny Goodman fan painted holes in his hands
So shaky hung him up to dry
The pundits were hoking the manholes were smoking
And every bottle battled with the reason why
The girl on the phone wouldnt leave me alone
A throw back from someones LP
A lemon in a bag played the tiger rag
And the bodies on the screen stopped bleeding
Yeah I was shaking like a leaf
For I couldnt understand the conversation
Yeah I ran to the street looking for information
Watch that man oh honey watch that man
He talks like a jerk but he could eat you with a fork and spoon
Watch that man oh honey watch that man
He walks like a jerk
But hes only taking care of the room
Must be in tuneOh come all you children
Dont grab that scabby hand
It belongs to Mr Sniff and Tell
It belongs to the candyman
Dont whore your little bodies
To the worms of paradise
Like Everest its fatal
Its peaks are cold as ice
Theyre riding on the subways
Theyre riding on the streets
Theyll ride you down to the gutters
Theyll ride you off your feet
Gonna hit Crack City
Hit Crack City
Yeah piss on the icon monsters
Whose guitars bequeath you pain
Theyll face you down to their level
With their addictions and their fast lanes
Corrupt with shaky visions
And crack and Coke and alcohol
Theyre just a bunch of assholes
With buttholes for their brains
You cant keep on riding
The pain you know so well
Theyll ride you down to the gutter
And theyll ride you down to Hell
Gonna hit Crack City
Hit Crack City
And you the master dealer
May death be on your brow
May razors slash your mainline
Im calling you out right now
May all your vilest nightmares
Consume your shrunken head
May the ho-ho-hounds of paranoia
Dance upon your stinking bed
Dont look at me you fuckhead
This nations turning blue
Its stink it fouls the highways
Its filth it sticks like glue
Gonna hit Crack City
Hit Crack City
Theyll bury you in velvet
And place you underground
The hatred of yourself
And the sufferings that conspire
To take your little body
And throw it to the fools
Only your mind can take you out of this
Only your mind or death
Im riding on the subway
The subway down to Hell
Ive finished with this journey
Now I seem to know it well
Gonna hit Crack City
Hit Crack City
Hit Crack City
Hit Crack City

They aint said I broke no rule
I aint never been in Dutch
I dont browse around too much
Dont bother me leave me alone
Anyway Im almost grown
I dont run around with no mob
Got myself a little job
Im gonna buy me a little car
Drive my girl in the park
Got my eye on a little girl
Ah shes really out of this world
When I take her to the dance
Shes got to talk about romanceInstrumentalFunny how secrets travel
Id start to believe if I were to bleed
Thin skies the man chains his hands held high
Cruise me blond
Cruise me babe
A blond belief beyond beyond beyond
No return No return
Im deranged
Deranged my love
Im deranged down down down
So cruise me babe cruise me baby
CHORUS
And the rain sets in
Its the angel-man
Im deranged
Cruise me cruise me cruise me babe
The clutch of life and the fist of love
Over your head
Big deal Salaam
Be real deranged Salaam
Before we reel
Im deranged
CHORUS two times
Cruise me cruise me cruise me babeWheres the pain in the violent night
Im depressed by the grill
I stay over many years
I should have thought of that
For the love of the money
Like a black-hearted vile thing
Its the nature of being
Its too many lonely nights
I cant tell bad from wrong
I cant pass you by
Too exchanging
Youve been around
But youve changed me
When the flesh meets the spirit world
Where the traffic is thin
I slip from a vacant view
I should have thought of that
And the sound of tomorrow
Like a black-hearted vile thing
Like the silence of tension
Its too many lonely nights
I cant tell good from bad
I cant pass you by
Too exchanging
Youve been around
But youve changed me
Youve been around
Cant pass you by
Youve been around
But youve changed me
Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-change
Too exchanging
Youve been around
But youve changed me
Youve been around
Cant pass you by
Youve been around
But youve changed me
Youve been around
Cant pass you by
Youve been around
But youve changed meAnd when she drowns
Within and in the fizzy gin begins to sigh
Good God oh my I cry
And die and lie beside
She is the apple in my eye
She talked to God
I couldnt cope ord hope eloped
A dope she roped this salty lie
And when shes dreaming I believe
And when shes reading I retreat
Cant believe her telling me shes dead again
Telling me shes dead against it
And deep my wound
Within for every second chance it was thy tore
From deep within despite the rain
My words are worn
She loves to talk into the phone
No matter who no matter when
No matter where
No better than the faulty line
And when shes dreaming I believe
And when shes reading I retreat
Cant believe her telling me shes dead again
Telling me shes dead against itI I wish you could swim
Like the dolphins
Like dolphins can swim
Though nothing nothing will keep us together
We can beat them forever and ever
Oh we can be heroes just for one day
I I will be King
And you you will be Queen
Though nothing will drive them away
We can be heroes just for one day
We can be us just for one day
I I can remember
I remember
Standing by the wall
By the wall
And the guns shot above our heads
Over our heads
And we kissed as though nothing could fall
Nothing could fall
And the shame was on the other side
Oh we can beat them forever and ever
Then we could be heroes just for one day
We can be heroes
We can be heroes
We can be heroes just for one day
We can be heroesI was Ramona A Stone I started with no enemies of my own In a tunnel I was an artiste And Ive been dreaming in a sleep But Ive been having a mid-life crisis And ape men with metal parts Ive spat upon deeply felt age And I hate the funny colored english Well creep together you and I Ive hid my hearts in For I know who the small friends are I am with name I am with name I am Ramona A Stone A night fear female Good timing drone I am with name I am with name I am with name I am with name Itll end in chrome I am Ramona A Stone She should say twitch stream good time drone Night of the female I am with name I am Ramona A Stone She should say I am with name I am Ramona A Stone A millenium fetish A person who loses a name Feels anxiety descending I am Ramona A Stone Left at the crossroads between the centuries I am with name I am with name I am with name Night fear female I am with name Good timing drone I am Ramona A Stone I am Ramona A Stone Give it to me one more time seven Anxiety descending Anxiety descendingSometimes the world is a valley of heartaches and tears
And in the hustle and bustle no sunshine appears
But you and I have our love always there to remind us
There is a way we can leave all the shadows behind us
Volare oh oh Cantare oh oh oh oh
Lets fly way up to the clouds away from the maddening crowds
We can sing in the glow of a star that I know of
Where lovers enjoy peace of mind
Let us leave the confusion and all disillusion behind
Just like birds of a feather a rainbow together well find
Volare oh oh Cantare oh oh oh oh
No wonder my happy heart sings
Your love has given me wings
Your love has given me wingsWholl ride in my rupert the riley

I really cant look at your little empty shelf
A ragged teddy bear
It feels like we never had a chance
Dont look me in the eye
We lay in each others arms
But the room is just an empty space
I guess we lived it out
Something in the air
We smile too fast
Then cant think of a thing to say
Lived with the best times
Left with the worst
Danced with you too long
Nothing left to save
Lets take what we can
I know youll hold your head up high
Weve raged for the last time
A place of no return
And theres something in the air
Something in my eye
Ive danced with you too long
Yeah
Something in the air
Something in my eye
Abracadoo I lose you
We cant avoid the clash the big mistake
Now were going to pay and pay
The sentence of our lives
Cant believe Im asking you to go
We used what we could
To get the things we want
But we lost each other on the way
I guess you know I never wanted anyone more than you
Lived all our best times
Left with the worst
Ive danced with you too long
Say what you will
Theres something in the air
Raged for the last time
But I know youll hold your head up high
Theres nothing we have to say
Theres nothing in our eyes
But theres something in the air
Something in my eye
I danced with you too long
Theres something I have to say
Theres something in the air
Something in my eye
Ive danced with you too long
Danced with you too long
Danced with you too long
And theres something in the air
Something in the airI was walking down the high street
When I heard footsteps behind me
And there was a little old man hello

This hmm Grace is my name and and I was hm
It was that phot a fading photograph of
A patch a patchwork quilt
And theyve put me on these
Ramona put me on these interest drugs
So Im thinking very too bit too fast like a brain hatch
And ah they wont let me see anybody
If I want to sometimes and I ask
I can still hear some pop popular musics and aftershocks
Ive been watching a television of um in the homelands
Thats the new homelands and um and thats all I can remember
And now they just want me to be quiet
And I think something is going to be horridLa la la la la la la la etc
Gather you all and listen here
Ill tell you a tale if you lend me an ear
I rode a horse through many a town
But the devil rode me down to the ground
I was to marry a very rich girl
I loved her as only I can
But the father was shot and his gold was stoled
And now Im the devils man na na na
And now I sing a tale of woe
Through the bars of the county jail na la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la etc
I walked into the room one night
I found her mother and gun
Well the man was dead and I kneeled and cried
The sheriff ran in and said Im holding you son
La la la la la la la la etc
Through the day I sing and play
For time is on my side
But when the moon and stars come out
I lay me down and cry
For the Saviour mar I lied
Now I will not have a ride
Beside the window the scaffold was made
On the morrow I will hang
La la la la la la la la etcYou never told me of your other faces
You were the widow of a wild cat
And now I know about your special kisses
And I know you know where thats at
I guess I recognize your destination
I think I see beneath your makeup
What you want is so separation
This is no ordinary
This is no ordinary
Oh oh oh
What a criminal world
The boys are like baby-faced girls
What a criminal girl
Shell show you where to shoot your gun
What a typical mothers son
The only thing that she enjoys
Is a criminal world
Where the girls are like baby-faced boys
Youve got a very heavy reputation
But no-one knows about your low-life
I know a way to find a situation
And hold a candle to your high-life disguise
You caught me kneeling at your sisters door
That was no ordinary stick-up
Im well aware just what youre looking for
I am no ordinary
I am no ordinary
Oh oh oh
What a criminal world
The boys are like baby-faced boys
What a criminal girl
Shell show you where to shoot your gun
What a typical mothers son
The only thing that she enjoys
Is a criminal world
Where the girls are like baby-faced boys
Baby-faced boys
Baby-face
What a criminal world
What a criminal
Criminal

UnverifiedI was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do What to do What to do
The outlook was decidedly blue
But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day Ive known
CHORUS
A foggy day in London Town
Had me low and had me down
I viewed the morning with alarm
The British Museum had lost its charm
How long I wondered could this thing last
But the age of miracles hadnt passed
For suddenly I saw you there
And through foggy London Town
The sun was shining everywhereJust the twinkling lights of heaven
Two reflections on the sparkling water
Hand in hand with love uh-huh
I love the cheap things that you say
You belong in rock nroll
You belong in rock nroll
You belong in rock nroll
Well so do i
I love how she moves me
It makes me feel alright alright alright alright
Im a hurt Im a hurt Im hurting
Im a man with a beat in my pocket
Im going down to the rhytm of love
I love the bad luck that you bring
You belong in rock nroll
You belong in rock nroll
You belong in rock nroll
Well so do i
Alone on the mean streets
It makes me feel on fire on fire on fire on fire on fire on fire on fire on fire on fire
I love the cheap street in your walk ah ha
You belong in rocknroll
You belong in rocknroll
Well so do i
I love how she moves me
It makes me feel alright alright alright alright If there is something
That I might find
Look around corners
Try to find peace of mind I say
where would you go
If you were me
Trying to keep a straight course is not easy
Somebody special
Looking at me
Same kind of reaction
Wanted to crie with me
Lived here and there
Its too easy to say
But the service just a game a game-ame-ame-ame
I would do anything for you
I would come all day
I would swim all the oceans blue hu
I would walk a thousand miles
Reveal my secrets
More than enough for me to share
I will put roses around the door
Sit in the garden
Growing potatoes by the score
Shake your head girl with your ponytail
Takes me right back when you were young
Throw your precious gifts into the air
Watch them fall down when you were young
Your love - feel you put them on the ground
It use to fall apart when you were young
Your love - feel you put them on the ground
The hills were higher when you were young
Your love - feel you put them on the ground
The trees were taller then when you were young
Your love - feel you put them on the ground
The grass was greener when you were young
Your love could feel you with devotion
Used to walk upon when you were youngBaby Grace is the victim
She was fourteen years of age
And the wheels are turning turning
For the finger points at me
Alls well
But I have not been to Oxford Town
Alls well
No I have not been to Oxford Town

Toll the bell
Pay the private eye

And the wheels are turning and turning
As the twentyth century dies
If I had not ripped the fabric
If time had not stood still
If I had not met Ramona
If Id only paid my bill
Alls well
But I have not been to Oxford Town
Alls well
But I have not been to Oxford Town

And every lamb ceases to graze
When the kiss of the comb
Tears my face from the bone
Ill be your light
When the shadows fall down the walls
Then life will be done
And it just wont matter at all
I was caught from a hand
Nurtured on grime goodwill and screams
Now your breath fills my step
Now there is you till life is gone
But Ill be your light
When the shadows fall down the walls
Then life will be done
And it just wont matter at all
Ill roll your ball
Till the stars cant make me cry
Then life will be done
And it just wont matter at all
Not at all
When the kiss of the comb
Tears my faceDear when I dance with you
We move like the sea
You youre all I want to know
I feel free
I feel free
I can walk down the street
Theres no one there
The pavement is one huge crowd
I can drive down the road
My eyes cant see
But my mind wants to cry out loud
I can walk down the street
Theres no one there
The pavement is one huge crowd
I can drive down the road
My eyes cant see
But my mind wants to cry out loud
My mind wants to cry out loud
I feel free
Dance floor is like the sea
The ceiling is the sky
Youre the sun and as you shine on me
I feel free
I feel free
I feel freeTin machine tin machine
Take me anywhere
Somewhere without alcohol
Or goons with muddy hair
Tin machine
Tin machine

The zombies that I pass
The guy that beats his baby up
The preachers and their past
Tin machine
Tin machine
Tin machine
Baby doll baby doll
Clarity and prayer
Theres more than money moving here
Theres mindless maggot glare
Working horrors humping Tories
Spittle on their chins
Carving up my childrens future
Read em pal and grin
Raging raging raging
Burning in my room
Cmon and get a good idea
Cmon and get it soon
Im waiting on the fire escape
Im not exactly well
Im neither red or black or white
Im grey and blown to hell
Tin machine tin machine
Make some new computer thing that puts me on the moon
Not this psycho time-bomb planet poised to meet its maker
Shake a leg
Tin machine tin machine
One sick deathless duty to remain endangered species
They reach right out to touch someone
Then wash their crusty hands
Tin machine
Tin machine
Baby doll baby doll
Blue suede tuneless wonders
Mass confusion faithless blues
Night that spews out watchmen
Mopping up another fortune
Fractured words and branca-sonic
Anger trapped behind locked doors
And right between the eyes
Raging raging raging
Burning in my room
Cmon and get a good idea
Cmon and get it soon
Im waiting on the fire escape
Im not exactly well
Im neither red or black or white
Im grey and blown to hell
Tin machine
Tin machine tin machine
Tin machine tin machine
Incomprehensible
Tin machine tin machine
Take me anywhereWhen I live my dream Ill take you with me
Riding on a golden horse
Well live within my castle with people there to serve you
Happy at the sound of your voice
Baby Ill slay a dragon for you
Or banish wicked giants from the land
But you will find that nothing in my dream can hurt you
We will only love each other as forever when I live my dream
When I live my dream Ill forgive the things youve told me
And the empty man you left behind
Its a broken heart that dreams its a broken heart you left me
Only love can live in my dream
Ill wish and the thunder clouds will vanish
Wish and the storm will fade away
Wish again and you will stand before me while the sky will paint an ouverture
And trees will play the rhythm of my dream
When I live my dream please be there to meet me
Let me be the one to understand
When I live my dream Ill forget the hurt you gave
Then we can live in our new land
Till the day my dream cascades around me
Im content to let you pass me by
Till that day youll run to many other men
But let them know its just for now
Tell them that Ive got a dream
And tell them youre the starring role
Tell them Im a dreaming kind of guy
And Im gonna make my dream
Tell them I will live my dream
Tell them they can laugh at me
But dont forget your date with me
When I live my dreamIm going home
Ive been gone much too long
She said she missed me
Since I been gone
Ill be back soon
Aint no doubt
cause she said she wanted my loving my loving
No holding back Im going home
No holding back Im going home
Im going stateside with my convictions
No holding back Im going home
No holding back Im going home
Im going stateside with my convictions
I said Im coming home soon
I dont know when
It Ill be sometime soon
Sooner than
I thought Id be
I thought Id be
I thought Id be stateside sooner or later
Marilyn inflatables home on the range
Where the living is easy on a horse with no name
Kennedy convertibles home on the range
Where the suffering comes easy on a blonde with no brain
Im going stateside
Im going stateside
Im going home
Its been so long
She said she missed me
And all the fun weve had
I think it be the best way
She said she missed me
Every every way so
No holding back Im going home
No holding back Im going home
Im going stateside with my convictions
No holding back Im going home
No holding back Im going home
Im going stateside with my convictions
Ive been gone so long
Ive been gone Ive been gone
Im missing you
Marilyn inflatables home on the range
Where the living is easy on a horse with no name
Kennedy convertibles home on the range
Where the suffering comes easy on a ten dollar raise
Im going stateside
Im going statesideWhilst his mothers womb contained the growing Baal
Even then the sky was waiting quiet and pale
Naked young immensely marvelous
Like Baal loved it when he came to us
That same sky remained with him in joy and care
Even when Baal slept peaceful and unaware
At night a lilac sky a drunken Baal
Turning pious as the sky grows pale
So through hospital cathedral whiskey bar
Baal kept moving onwards and just let things go
When Baals tired boys Baal cannot fall far
He will have his sky down there below
When the sinners congregate in shame together
Baal lay naked reveling in their distress
Only sky a sky that will go on forever
Formed a blanket for his nakedness
And that lusty girl the world wholl laughing yield
To the men wholl stand the pressure of her thighs
Sometimes gave him love-bites such as cant be healed
Baal survived it he just used his eyes
And when Baal saw lots of corpses scattered round
He felt twice the thrill despite the lack of room
Space enough said Baal Then Ill thicken the ground
Space enough within this womans womb
Any vice for Baal has got its useful side
Its the man who practices it he cant abide
Vices have their point once you see it as such
Stick to two for one will be too much
Slackness softness are the sort of things to shun
Nothing could be harder than the quest for fun
Lots of strength is needed and experience too
Swollen bellies can embarrass you
Under gloomy stars and this poor veil of tears
Baal will graze a pasture till it disappears
Once its been digested to the forests teeth
Baal trod singing for a well earned sleep
Baal can spot the vultures in the stormy sky
As they wait up there to see if Baal will die
Sometimes Baal pretends hes dead but vultures swoop
Baal in silence dines on vulture-soup
When the dark womb drags him down to its prize
Whats the world still mean to Baal hes overfed
So much sky is lurking still behind his eyes
Hell just have enough sky when hes dead
Once the Earths dark womb engulfed the rotting Baal
Even then the sky was up there quiet and pale
Naked young immensely marvelous
Like Baal loved it when he lived with usWhite boys falling on the fires of night
I wish youd tell I wish youd tell
Flesh punks burning in their glue
Revolution comes in the strangest way
I wish youd tell I wish youd tell
Id rather be inside you

Als ob nichts geschieht
Und die scham fiel auf ihre seite
Oh wir koennen sie schlagen
Fyr alle zeiten
Dann sind wir helden
Nur diesen tag

Back away from the light
Its all deranged - no control
Sit tight in your corner
Dont tell God your plans
Its all deranged
No control
If I could control tomorrows haze
The darkened shore wouldnt bother me
If I cant control the web we weave
My life will be lost in the fallen leaves
Every single moves uncertain
Dont tell God your plans
Its all deranged
No control
I should live my life on bended knee
If I cant control my destiny
Youve gotta have a scheme
Youve gotta have a plan
In the world of today for tomorrows man
No control
Stay away from the future
Dont tell God your plans
Its all deranged
No control
Forbidden words deafen me
In memory no control
See how far a sinful man
Burns his tracks his bloody robes
Youve gotta have a scheme
Youve gotta have a plan
In the world of today for tomorrows man
I should live my life on bended knee
If I cant control my destiny
No control I cant believe Ive no control
Its all deranged
I cant believe Ive no control
Its all deranged
Deranged
DerangedGetting my facts from a Benneton ad
Im lookin through African eyes
Lit by the glare of an LA fire
Ive got a face not just my race Bang Bang Ive got you babe
Sun comes up and the man goes down
And the woman comes again
Just an hour or so to be safe from fear
Then we jump through hoops were divisable now just disappear
We reach out over race and hold each others hands
Then die in the flames singing we shall overcome
Whoa Whats going on
Therell be some blood no doubt about it
But well come through dont doubt it
I look into your eyes and I know you wont kill me
You wont kill me
You wont kill me
But I look into your eyes
And I wonder sometimes
Oh Lord just let him see me
Lord Lord just let him hear me
Let him call me brother
Let him put his arms around me
Let him put his hands together
Reach over race and hold each others hands
Walk through the night thinking we are the world
Woa Whats going on
Therell be some blood no doubt about it
But well come through dont doubt it
I look into your eyes and I know you wont kill me
You wont kill me
You wont kill me
But I wonder why
Yes and I wonder why sometimes
Theyll show us how to break the rules
But never how to make the rules
Reduce us down to witless punks
Facist cries both black and white whos got the blood whos got the gun
Putting on the black tie cranking out the white noiseMy name is Mr Touchshriek
Of Touchshriek with mail over and fantasy
My shop sells egg shells
Off the seashores and empty females
Im thinking of leasing the room above my shop
To a Mr Walloff Domburg
A reject from the world wide Internet
Hes a broken man Im also a broken man
It would be nice to have company
We could have great conversations
Looking through windows for demons
And watching the young advance in all electric
Some of the houses around here still have inhabitants in them
Im not sure if theyre from this country or not
I dont get to speak much to anyone or that sort of thing
If I had another broken name
Oh I dream of something like thatYou always were the one that knew
They sold us for the likes of you
I always wanted new surroundings
A room to rent while the lizards lay crying in the heat
Trying to remember who to meet
I would take a foxy kind of stand
While tens of thousands found me in demand
Chorus
When you rock n roll with me
No one else Id rather be
Nobody here can do it for me
Im in tears again
When you rock n roll with me
Gentle hearts are counted down
The queue is out of sight and out of sounds
Me Im out of breath but not quite doubting
Ive found a door which lets me outAll our friends
Now seem so thin and frail
Slinky secrets
Hotter than the sun
No peachy frairs
No trendy rechauffe
Im with you
So I cant go on
All my violence raining tears upon the sheets
Im bewildered for were strangers when we meet
Blank screen tv
Preening ourselves in the snow
Forget my name
But Im over you
Blended sunrise
And its a dying world
Humming Rheingold
We scavenge up our clothes
All my violence raging tears upon the sheets
Im resentful for were strangers when we meet
Cold tired fingers
Tapping out your memories
Halfway sadness
Dazzled by the new
Your embrace
It was all that I feared
That whirling room
We trade by vendu
Steely resolve is falling from me
My poor soul poor bruised passivity
All your regrets ran rough-shod over me
Im so glad that were strangers when we meet
Im so thankful cause were strangers when we meet
Im in clover for were strangers when we meet
Heel head over cause were strangers when we meet
Strangers when we meet Are you OK
Youve been shot in the head
And Im holding your brains
The old woman said
So I drink in the shadows
Of an evening sky
See nothing at all
The stars look so special
And the snow looks so old
The frail form is drifting
Beyond the yoga zone
Turn to question the mountain
Why pigs can fly
Its nothing at all
I praise to you
Nothing ever goes away
I praise to you
Nothing ever goes
I praise to you
I praise to you
Nothing ever goes away
I praise to you
Nothing ever goes
I praise to you
Nothing ever goes away
I praise to you
Nothing ever goes nothing ever goes
NothingSee these eyes so green
I can stare for a thousand years
Colder than the moon
Well its been so long
And Ive been putting out the fire with gasoline
See these eyes so red
Red like jungle burning bright
Those who feel me near
Pull the blinds and change their minds
Its been so long
Still this pulsing night
A plague I call a heartbeat
Just be still with me
But it wouldnt believe what Ive been through
Youve been so long
Well its been so long
Ive been putting out the fire with gasoline
Putting out the fire
With gasoline
See these tears so blue
An ageless heart that can never mend
Tears can never dry
A judgment made can never bend
See these eyes so green
I can stare for a thousand years
Just be still with me
You wouldnt believe what Ive been through
Well youve been so long
Its been so long
And Ive been putting out fire with gasoline

The woman I loved is dead
There was a boy
A very strange enchanted boy
They say he wandered very far
Very far over land and sea
A little child and sailed about
But very wise was he
And then one day one magic day he passed my way
While we spoke of many things fools and kings this he said to me
The greatest thing youll ever learn
Is just to love and be loved in returnWhite light - White light gonna drive me out of my brain
White light - White light gonna make me feel so insane

Feeling like lost little children in fabled lands
So I listen for each and every friendship

You whisper sweet nothing but reading between your lines
I listen color me doubtful

Your eyes are heavy and your limbs all ache
Youve bought some coffee butter and bread
You cant make a thing cause the meters dead
You moved away
Hold your folks youre gonna stay away
Bright lights Soho Wardour street
You hope you make friends with the guys that you meet
Somebody shows you round
Now youve met the London boys
Things seem good again someone cares about you
Oh the first time that you tried a pill
You feel a little queasy decidedly ill
Youre gonna be sick but you mustnt lose faith
To let yourself down would be a big disgrace
With the London boys with the London boys
Youre only seventeen but you think youve grown
In the month youve been away from your parents home
You take the pills too much
You dont give a damn about that jobs youve got
So long as youre with the London boysTelling lies
Gorgeous girls are bound to meet
To talk of stars and kings and feet
Through the chromosomes of space and time
Me Im fast like bad infection
Gasping for my resurrection
Swear to me in times of war and stress

Shadow falls in shrinking smiles
See me poised at the happy games
Standing in the mouth of all thats pure
Come straggling in your tattered remnants
You come to me with tears and blame Im your future
Ask tomorrow I am the end

Let me understand
Drifting down a silent park
Stumbling over land
Open up your heart to me
Show me who you are
And I would be your slave
Do you sleep in quietude
Do you walk in peace
Do you laugh out loud at me
No one else that is free
Open up your heart to me
Show me all you are
And I would be your slave
I dont sit around and wait
I dont give a damn
I dont see the point at all
No footprints in the sand
I bet you laugh out loud at me
A chance to strike me down
Give me peace of mind at last
Show me all you are
Open up your heart to me
And I would be your slaveIve been looking Ive been looking
Ive been looking Ive been looking
Ive been looking
For a woman
To save my life
Not to beg or to borrow
A woman with a feeling
of loosing once or twice
Who knows how it could be
Be tomorrow
Ive been waiting for you
And youve been coming to me
For such a long time now
For such a long time now
A woman with a feeling
Of loosing once or twice
Who knows how it could be
Be tomorrow
Ive been waiting for you
And youve been coming to me
For such a long time now
For such a long time now
For such a long time now
For such a long time nowThe words I have to say
May well be simple but theyre true
Until you give your love
Theres nothing more that we can do
Love is the opening door
Love is what we came here for
No-one can offer you more
You know what I mean
Have your eyes really seen
You say you find it hard
To lead the life that we once knew
But theres no other way
So now its really up to you
Love is the key we must turn
Truth is the flame we must learn
Freedom the lesson we must learn
Do you know what I mean
Have your eyes really seen
Love is the key we must turn
Truth is the flame we must burn
Freedom the lesson we must learn
Do you know what I mean
Have your eyes really seen
You say you find it hard
To lead the life that we once knew
But theres no other way
So now its really up to you
Love is the key we must turn
Truth is the flame we must learn
Freedom the lesson we must learn
Do you know what I mean
Have your eyes really seen
Love is the key we must turn
Truth is the flame we must burn
Freedom the lesson we must learn
Do you know what I mean

When you rock n roll with me
No one else Id rather be
Nobody here can do it for me
Im in tears again
When you rock n roll with me
Gentle hearts are counted down
The queue is out of sight and out of sounds
Me Im out of breath but not quite doubting
Ive found a door which lets me outI just cannot believe
That you want me
Beg at your door
I just cannot believe
That you want me
Forever more
Time and time I tried to make you mine
I didnt think it would be such a short time
Before you came my way
Up where the moon is shining so bright
Thats where my heart is tonight
Up where the moon is so bright
Thats where my heart is tonight
I thought my day would come
When I would be
The only one
I thought my day would come
Under the moon
And under the sun
Now I shout through all the streets today
Lucky me your love has come my way
Now tell me I was a fool
Up where the moon is shining so brightly
Thats where my heart is tonight
Up where the moon is so bright
Thats where my heart is tonight
I believe that dreams come through
I believe because of you
He who made the stars in sky
Made the world for you and i
I just cannot believe
That you want me
Beg at your door
I just cannot believe
That you want me
Forever more
Time and time I tried to make you mine
I didnt think it would be such a short time
Before you came my way
Up where the moon is shining so bright
Thats where my heart is tonight
Up where the moon is so bright
Thats where my heart is tonightI bless you madly
Sadly as I tie my shoes
I love you badly
Just in time at times I guess
Because of you I need to rest
Because its you
That sets the test
So much has gone
And little is new
And as the sparrow sings
Dawn chorus for
Someone else to hear
The Thinker sits alone growing older
And so bitter
I gave Them life
I gave Them all
They drained my very soul
Dry
I crushed my heart
To ease their pains
No thought for me remains there
Nothing can they spare
What of me
Who praised their efforts
To be free
Words of strength and care
And sympathy
I opened doors
That would have blocked their way
I braved their cause to guide
For little pay
I ravaged at my finance just for those
Those whose claims were steeped in peace tranquility
Those who said a new world new ways ever free
Those whose promises stretched in hope and grace for me
I bless you madly
Sadly as I tie my shoes
I love you badly just in time
At times I guess
Because of you I need to rest oh yes
Because its you
That sets the test
So much has gone
And little is new
And as the sunrise stream
Flickers on me
My friends talk
Of glory untold dream where all is God and God is just a word
We had a friend a talking man
Who spoke of many powers that he had
Not of the best of men but ours
We used him
We let him use his powers
We let him fill our needs
Now we are strong
And the road is coming to its end
Now the damned have no time to make amends
No purse of token fortune stands in our way
The silent guns of love
Will blast the sky
We broke the ruptured structure built of age
Our weapons were the tongues of crying rage
Where money stood
We planted seeds of rebirth
And stabbed the backs of fathers
Sons of dirt
Infiltrated business cesspools
Hating through our sleeves
Yea and we slit the Catholic throat
Stoned the poor
On slogans such as
Wish You Could Hear
Love Is All We Need
Kick Out The Jams
Kick Out Your Mother
Cut Up Your Friend
Screw Up Your Brother or Hell Get You In the End
And we know the flag of love is from above
And we can force you to be free
And we can force you to believe
And I close my eyes and tighten up my brain
For I once read a book in which the lovers were slain
For they knew not the words of the Free States refrain
It said
I believe in the power of good
I believe in the state of love
I will fight for the right to be right
I will kill for the good of the fight for the right to be right
And I open my eyes to look around
And I see a child laid slain
On the ground
As a love machine lumbers through desolation rows
Plowing down man woman listening to its command
But not hearing anymore
Not hearing anymore
Just the shrieks from the old rich
And I want to believe
In the madness that calls Now
And I want to believe
That a lights shining through
Somehow
And I want to believe
And you want to believe
And we want to believe
And we want to live
Oh we want to live
We want to live
We want to live
We want to live
We want to live
We want to live
I want to live
I want to live
I want to live
I want to live
I want to live
I want to live
Live

Oh
And I know
Like a mirror Sunday morning
When the dark clouds hung above
I saw you kneeling neath a garden
I saw the grim and stood above
What kind of meaning in a gun shot
It doesnt matter what they say
I never felt I aimed at no one
And whos gonna take the gun away
Julie
Pretend for me
That Im someone in your life
Julie
Im yours till the end
All the days and memories
Im not a man of single reason
Its in every single man
This beat of jealous retribution
And every spurned heart makes its plan
Well I know that you really loved him
And I know that if theres a God above
Through million times well remember
How the trail slips away
Julie
Pretend for me
Even only for a while
Julie
My soul is on the line
All the days and memories
Julie
Remember me
All the days of your life
Julie
Im lost over you

Once upon a time there was a toy soldier with a whip lash in his hand
And every night little girl sadie would take all her clothes off and wind up the toy soldier and he raised his whip and said
On your knees little sadie
Little sadie on your knees
Taste the whip and love might given likely
Taste the whip and bleed for me
Little sadie loved her little toy soldier
And she run home from school each day
Little sadie loved her little toy soldier
And she locked her door so she could play
Little sadie got ambitious
And wound the clockworks so to tighter
So he could whip her harder and harder
On your knees little sadie
Little sadie on your knees
Taste the whip and love might given likely
Taste the whip and bleed for me
One day sadie wound and wound
And wound and wound
And wound and wound
Til suddenly the little toy soldier spring went
ugly beat her to death

Out of town where the people I knew
I had the feeling of self-pity
What to do what to do what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue
But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day Ive ever known
A foggy day in a london town
Had me low and had me down
I viewed the morning with alarm
The british museum had lost its charm
How long I wondered could this thing last
But the age of miracles hadnt passed
For suddenly I saw you there
And through foggy london town the sun was shining everywhereGrown inside a plastic box
Micro thoughts and safety locks
Hearts become outdated clocks
Tickin in your mind
Now its time to close our eyes
Ahh
Now its time to say goodbye
Ahh
Now its time to face the lie
Ahh
That wed never cry
Whats really happening

And theyre slowly sinking
Falling like the shattered past
Were we built to last

Ya yaIve nothing much to offer - theres nothing much to take
Im an absolute beginner - but Im absolutely sane
As long as were together - the rest can go to hell
I absolutely love you - but were absolute beginners
With eyes completely open - but nenrous all the same
If our love-song could fly over mountains
Could laugh at the ocean just like the films -
Theres no reason to feel over hard timesTo lay down the hard lines - its absolutely twe
Nothing much could happen - nothing we cant shakeThough were absolute beginners - weve nothing much at stake
As long as youre still smiling - theres nothing more I need
I absolutely love you - but were absolute beginners
Well if my love is your love - were certain to succeed
If your love-song could fly over mountains
Sail over heartaches just like the films -
If theres reason to feel over hard times
To lay down the hard lines - its absolutely trueWell I got a girl thats so good to me little Liza

Little Liza Jane
Well Im coming back to me love
Cause shes driving insane
When will I meet herSpy spy pretty girl
I see you see me through your window
Dont turn your nose up
Well you can if you need to you wont be the first or the last
It must strain you to look down so far from your fathers house
And I know what a louse like me in his house could do for you
Im the cream
Of the great Utopia dream
And youre the gleam
In the depths of your bankers spleen
Im a phallus in pigtails
And theres blood on my nose
And my tissue is rotting
Where the rats chew my bones
And my eye sockets empty
See nothing but pain
I keep having this brainstorm
About twelve times a day
So nowYou could spend the morning walking with mequite amazed
As Im unwashed and somewhat slightly dazed
I got eyes in my backside
That see electric tomatoes
On credit card rye bread
There are children in washrooms
Holding hands with a queen
And my heads full of murders
Where only killers scream
So now you could spend the morning talking with me quite amazed
Look out Im raving mad and somewhat slightly dazed
Now you run from your window
To the porcelain bowl
And youre sick from your ears
To the red parquet floor
And the braque on the wall
Slides down your front
And eats through your belly
Its very catching
So nowyou should spend the mornings lying to your father quite amazed
About the strange unwashed and happily slightly dazedWell I pity the fool I said I pity the fool
You know I pity the fool I said I pity the fool
That falls all in love with you and expects you to be true
I pity the fool
Well look at the people
I bet you wonder what they do
Yeah theyre just standing there
Watching you making a fool out of me
Yeah look at the people
I bet you wonder what they do
Yeah theyre just standing there
Watching you making a fool out of me
I pity the fool I said I pity the fool
Ooh I pity the fool let me tell you that I pity the fool
Cos shell break your heart one day and shell laugh as she walks away
Well I pity the fool
Yeah look at the people
Bet you wonder what they do
Well theyre just standing there
Watching you making a fool out of me
Yeah look at the people
Bet you wonder what they do
Well theyre just standing there
Watching you making a fool out of me
I pity the fool I pity the fool that falls in love with you
Hey hey yeah I pity the fool
I pity the fool that falls in love with youThis girl is made of lipstick
Powder and paint
Sees the pictures of herself
Every magazine on every shelf
This girl is maid of bond street
Hailing cabs lunches with executives
Gleaming teeth sip aperitifs
This girl is a lonely girl
Takes the train from paddington to oxford circus
Buys the daily news
But passengers dont smile at her dont smile at her
This girl is made of loneliness
A broken heart
For the boy that she once knew
Doesnt want to know her any more
And this girl is a lonely girl
Every thing she wants is hers
But she cant make it with the boy she really wants to be with
All the time to love all the time
This boy is made of envy
Jealousy
He doesnt have a limousine
Really wants to be a star himself
This girl her world is made of flashlights and films
Her cares are scraps on the cutting room floor
And maids of bond street drive round in chauffered cars
Maids of bond street picture clothes eyes of stars
Maids of bond street shouldnt have worldly cares
Maids of bond street shouldnt have love affairsIm on my own nowhere to roam
I tell you baby dont want no home
I wander round feet off the ground
I even go from town to town
I said I think this rock is grand
Say Ill be your man
Dont bring me down
Dont bring me down
I met this chick the other day
And then to me she said shell stay
I get this pad just like a cave
And then well have our living made
And then Ill lead her on the ground
My head is spinning round
Dont bring me down
Dont bring me down
No
Huh huh huh
I need a lover whos someone new
And then to her I will be true
Ill buy her furs and pretty things
Ill even buy a wedding ring
But until then Ill settle down
Say Ill be your man
Dont bring me down
Dont bring me down
An until then Ill stare the hand
Say Ill be your man
Dont bring me down
Dont bring me down
Dont bring me downSickened by sun with rainstorms lashing him rotten
A looted wreath crowning his tangled hair
Every moment of his youth apart from its dream was forgotten
Gone the roof overhead but the sky was always there
Oh you who are flung out alike from heaven and from Hades
You murderers whove been so bitterly repaid
Why did you part from the mothers who nursed you as babies
It was peaceful and you slept and there you stayed
Still he explores and rakes the absinthe green oceans
Though his mother has given him up for lost
Grinning and cursing with a few odd tears of contrition
Always in search of that land where life seems best
Loafing through hells and flocked through paradises
Calm and grinning with a vanishing face
At times he still dreams of a small field he recognises
With a blue sky overhead and nothing elseDo you remember a guy thats been
In such an early song
Ive heard a rumour from ground control
Oh no dont say its true
They got a message from the action man
im happy hope youre happy too
Ive loved all Ive needed love
Sordid details following
The shrieking of nothing is killing
Just pictures of jap girls in synthesis and i
Aint got no money and I aint got no hair
But Im hoping to kick but the planet its glowing
Ashes to ashes funk to funky
We know major toms a junkie
Strung out in heavens high
Hitting an all-time low
Time and again I tell myself
Ill stay clean tonight
But the little green wheels are following me
Oh no not again
Im stuck with a valuable friend
im happy hope youre happy too
One flash of light but no smoking pistol
I never done good things
I never done bad things
I never did anything out of the blue woh-o-oh
Want an axe to break the ice
Wanna come down right now
Ashes to ashes funk to funky
We know major toms a junkie
Strung out in heavens high
Hitting an all-time low
My mother said to get things done
Youd better not mess with major tom
My mother said to get things done
Youd better not mess with major tom
My mother said to get things done
Youd better not mess with major tom
My mother said to get things done
Youd better not mess with major tomWell I wouldnt buy no merchandise
And I wouldnt go to war
And I mixed with other colors
But the nurse doesnt care
And I hide under blankets
Or did I run away
I really cant remember
Last time I saw the light of day
But I remember Sam cause he was like me
Scream like a baby
Sam was a gun
And I never knew his last name
And we never had no fun
Well they came down hard on the faggots
And they came down hard on the street
They came down harder on Sam
And they all knew he was beat
He was thrown into the wagon
Blindfolded chains and they stomped on us
And took away our clothes and things
And pumped us full of strange drugs
And oh I saw Sam falling
Spitting in their eyes
But now I lay me down to sleep
And now I close my eyes
Now Im learning to be a part of socie-soc-soci-tsociety
Scream like a baby
Sam was a gun
And I never knew his last name
And we never had no fun
No athletic program no discipline no book
He just sat in the backseat swearing hed seek revenge
But he jumped into the furnace singing old songs we loved
Scream like a baby
Sam was a gun
And I never knew his last name
And we never had no fun
Scream like a baby
Sam was a gun
And I never knew his last name
And we never had no funMy name is mr touchshriek
Of touchshriek with mail over and fantasy
My shop sells egg shells off the shesores and empty females
Im thinking of leasing the room above my shop
To a mr walloff domburg
A reject from the world wide internet
Hes a broken man
Im also a broken man
It would be nice to have company
We could have great conversations
Looking through windows for demons
And watching the young advance in all electric
Some of the houses around here still have inhabitants in them
Im not sure if theyre from this country or not
I dont get to speak much to anyone or that sort of thing
If I had another broken name
Oh I dream of something like thatfive hundred and fifteen
Im changing trains
This little town
Let me down
This foreign rain
Brings me down
five hundred and fifteen
Train overdue
Angels have gone
No ticket
Im jumping tracks
Im changing towns
We never talk anymore
Forever I will adore you
five hundred and fifteen
All of my life
Angels have gone
Im changing trains
Angels like them
Thin on the ground
All of my life
All legs and wings
Strange sandy eyes
five hundred and fifteen
Train overdue
Angels have gone
We never talk anymore
Forever I will adore you
Cold station
All of my life
Forever Im out here foreverIf a womans hips are ample
Then I want her in the hay
Skirt and stocking all a rample
Cheerfully
For thats my way
If the woman bites in pleasure
Then I wipe it clean with hay
My mouth her lap together
Thoroughly
For thats my way
If a woman goes on loving
When I feel to tired to play
Id smile and go off waving amiably
For thats my wayTheres a cry that is heard in the city
From Vivian at Pentecost lane
A shriekin and dancing till four am
Another night of muscles and pain
I love you despite your convictions
That God never laughs at my jokes
Im a young man at odds with the Bible
But I dont pretend faith never works
Were down on our knees prayin at the bus stop
Now Jesus He came in a vision
And offered you redemption from sin
Im not sayin that I dont believe you
But are you sure that it really was Him
Ive been told that it couldnve been blue cheese
Or the meal that we ate down the road
Im a young man at odds with the Bible
But I dont pretend faith never works
When were down on our knees prayin at the bus stop oh yeahThink about the good things
Think about the bad things
Think about a reason to see you tonight
Something getting hard when you rock it up
Something getting hot when you rock it up
Pretty little girl let your sweet thing sway
Never gonna treat you wrong
Tie you down pretend youre madonna
Never gonna treat you wrong
Oh you pretty thing
Shake your pretty thing
Gimmee that pretty thing
Think about the love thing
Think about the sex thing
Think about you holding me taking me down
Something getting hard when you rock it up
Something getting hot when you rock it up
Pretty little girl let your sweet thing sway
Never gonna do you wrong
Strip you down and take you to pieces
Always gonna love this song
Oh you pretty thing
Feel that pretty thing
Suck that pretty thing

Dont have the time
To look things over
Make up their minds
People from good homes
Dnt have the minds
To care for bad homes
Dont have the time
Home is the main line
Cant take the plain
Those people have notions
Play out this game
Stand on your own line
Stand high above
These people of caution
Trouble to love
Me I got no home
Just main street and wine
No one to hussle no one to jive
Me and my prospects just having a ball
Having the best time but nothing at all
Home is the main line
Cant take the plain
Those people have notions
Play out this game
Stand on your own line
Stand high above
These people of caution
Trouble to love
Home is the main line
Cant take the plain
Those people have notions
Play out this game
Stand on your own line
Stand high above
These people of caution
Trouble to love
Oh yeahPoor soul
Spit upon that
Poor soul
He never knew what hit him
And it hit him so
Poor dunce
He pushed back the pigmen
The Barbs laughed
The fool is dead
Poor dunce
Hes less than within us
The brains talk
But the will to live is dead
And prayer cant travel so far these days
The talk of your life
Standing so near
To innocent eyes
Poor dunce
Swings through the tunnels
And claws his way
Is small life so manic
Are these really the days
Poor dunce
Poor dunce
Poor soul
Poor soul
Poor soulHe swivels his head
Tears his eyes from the screen
As his past puts him back in Atlantic City
Theres not even a demon in Heaven or Hell
Is it all just human disguise
As I walk down the aisle
Gone gone gone spinning slack through the end
Deadens my brain falling up through the years
Till I swivel back round then I fly fly fly
Losing breath from the water then Im gone gone gone
And Im gone gone gone
Now Im older than movies
Let me dance away
Now Im wiser than dreams
Let me fly fly fly
While Im touching tomorrow
And I know whos there
When silhouettes fall
And Im gone
Like Im dancing on angels
And Im gone through a crack in the past
Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man walking
Three old men dancing under the lamplight
Shaking their sex and their bones
And the boys that we were
An alien nation in therapy
Sliding naked and new
Like a bad tempered child
On a rain slicked street
Gone gone gone spinning slack through the end
Deadens my brain falling up through the years
Till I swivel back round then I fly fly fly
Losing breath from the water then Im gone gone gone
And Im gone
And Im gone like Im dancing on angels
And Im gone through the crack in the past
Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man
Like a dead man walking
And Im gone gone gone
Let me dance dance dance
And Im gone gone gone
Let me dance dance dance
And Im gone like Im dancing on angels
And Im gone through a crack in the past
And Im gone like Im dancing on angels
And Im gone through a crack in the past
Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man

Were whats happening
Nightclubbing were nightclubbing
Were an ice machine
We see people brand new people
Theyre something to see
Nightclubbing real nightclubbing
Or isnt it wild
Nightclubbing were nightclubbing
Were walking through town
Nightclubbing were nightclubbing
We walk like a ghost
We learn dancers brand new dances
Like the nuclear bomb
When were nightclubbing
Bright white clubbing
Or isnt it wildI recall how we lived
On the corner of a bed
And wed speak of a Swedish room
Of hessian and wood
And wed talk with our eyes
Of the sweetness in our lives
And tomorrows of rich surprise
Some things we could do
In our madness
We burnt one hundred days
Time takes time to pass
And I still hold some ashes to me
An Occasional Dream
And wed sleep oh so close
But not really close our eyes
Tween the sheets of summer bathed in blue
Gently weeping nights
It was long long ago
And I cant touch your name
For the days of fater were strong for you
Danced you far from me
In my madness
I see your face in mine
I keep a photograph
It burns my wall with time
Time
An occasional dream
Of mine
An occasional dream
Of mine
An occasional dream
Of mineOnce there was a fellow and his name was buzz
He was just a rookie cop just a baby buzz
He patroled the sunset strip in the land of the free and the home of the hip
He protected you and me from evil women like poor alice d
Alice was the girl that all the hippies dread
And they called her sweet alice the head
Alice it was plain to see was full of pot and std
Shed attract a great big crowd because her inner piece was much too loud
Good buzz did the thing that all the good buzz must
Stuck his gun in alices back and said this is a buzz
Shone the flashlight in her eyes she began to hypnotise
Buzz said what a wild sensation guess this must be hallucination
Love is so sensational when you fall in love with eyes dilational
Now theyre taking pills in shops buzz is not afraid of what
Buzz and alice d have shown the way of where the buzz might be some day
Buzz is still a cop of course hes the pusher on the porch
Hes protecting you and me from evil women like poor alice dChorus
All clear wail the sirens
Sunshine on the wasteland
Old man sitting in the white sand
Think were in for a big surprise
Right between the eyes
Seemed a good idea
To drop a bomb on the wasteland here
Only one man could be seen
And he was old and so serene
Captain sat in his deck chair
And the red light flashed Beware
Pilot felt quite big-time
As the bomb sailed through the air
Well they danced and sang
When the bang went bang
When the lights popped out
And the smoke began to clear
It was positively queer
Chorus
Die said the General
Cobblers said the man
So the Pentagon sent a cable
And the Queen a telegram
A-bombs H-bombs even very small ones
Ripped apart that sand
Til the stench was just revolting
And the sky a greenish tan
But the soldier said Sir
Theres a crack in the world
And the figures went squash
And the bits flew far and wide
How the universe sighed
When the smoke had blown away
There was nothing left to view
Except a man dear Lord who looked like you
Floating high up in the skySegue
I was
Ramona A Stone
I started with no enemies of my own
I was an artiste
In a tunnel
But Ive been having a mid-life crisis
And Ive been dreaming of sleep
And ape men with metal parts
Ive spat upon deeply felt age
Ive hid my hearts in
And I hate the funny colored english
Well creep togeher you and I
For I know who the small friends are
Song
I am with name I am with name
I am Ramona A Stone
A night fear female
Good timing drone
I am with name I am with name
I am with name I am with name
I am Ramona A Stone
She should say twitch stream
Itll end in chrome
Night of the female good time drone
I am with name
I am Ramona A Stone
She should say
I am with name
I am Ramona A Stone
A person who loses a name
Feels anxiety descending
Left at the crossroads between the centuries
A millenium fetish
I am with name I am with name
I am Ramona A Stone
I am with name
Night fear female
Good timing drone
I am with name
I am Ramona A Stone
I am Ramona A Stone
Give it to me one more time
Anxiety descending
Anxiety descendingYes Ive read the morning papers
Telling me that youve made money
Do you think Im gonna crawl then think again
Though Im dressed in rags Im richer
Though I eat from tins Im healthier
Though I live in slums Im purer than you my friend
Too bad Im not losing sleep
too bad Im just counting sheep
too bad Im not losing sleep my friend
Look around and see the friends
The ones you left our friends deserted
See the guys that used to talk and drink with you
Dont look down your nose at me
cause I wont ask your sympathy
I wont be your yes-sir man for anything
Too bad Im not losing sleep
too bad Im just counting sheep
too bad Im not losing sleep my friend
I would walk with you
Talk with you drink with you
If you drop that halo that youre wearing on the ground
Too bad Im not losing sleep
too bad Im just counting sheep
too bad Im not losing sleep my friend
I cant get my satisfaction
Knowing you wont get reaction
What makes me the big attraction anyway
Its too bad Im not losing sleep
too bad Im just counting sheep
too bad Im not losing sleep my friend
Too bad Im not losing sleep
too bad Im just counting sheep

Back to my baby
Back to where they need meIt was a day in that blue month september
Silent beneath the plum trees slender shade
I held her there
My love so pale and silent
As if she were a dream that must not fade
Above us in the shining summer heaven
There was a cloud my eyes dwelled long upon
It was quite white and very high above us
Then I looked up
And found that it had gone
And since that day so many moons in silence
Have swum across the sky and gone below
The plum trees surely have been chopped for firewood
And if you ask how does that love seem now
I must admit I really cant remember
And yet I know what you are trying to say
But what her face was like I know no longer
I only know I kissed it on that day
As for the kiss I long ago forgot it
But for the cloud that floated in the sky
I know that still and shall forever know it
It was quite white and moved in very high
It may be that the plum trees still are blooming
That womans seventh child may now be there
And yet that cloud had only bloomed for minutes
When I looked up
It vanished on the airRamona is so cold
When she broke it off with Leon
She said The ring is enough
I dont wanna see his face again
Ramona was so coldInstrumentalCruising around me
The flames burn my body
Wishful beginnings
Does this remind them again and again
Youre a sorry little girl youre a sorry little girl
Please hide for the pain must feel like snow
Youre a sorry little girl
Sorry little girl
Please hide from the kiss and the bite
Shame burns
Breathing in breathing out
Breathing in only doubt
The pain must feel like snow
Im no longer your golden boy
Sorry little girl
Im sorry little girl
The pain must feel like snow
There you go cover me cover me
We flew on the wings
We were deep in the dead air
And this one will never go down
We had such wishful beginnings
But we lived unbearable lives
Im sorry little girl sorry little girl
So so sorry little girl
The pain must feel like snow
There you go
There you goHey Jack I better shake it off put her out of my head
Thinking I balled just another young girl last night
Oh brother I left a woman in that morning bed
Been on that trip so many times
Good God was it really yesterday
Ive tried so many many many many many many ways
Ive lied and taken off into the day
Leaving another girl to weep over the breakfast tray
Loved her before I knew her name hit me Jack cos Im
Gonna love her way
Come back my babe
Come back my babe
Be holy again I gave her
I gave her maybe maybe
Maybe gotta give her ooh baby baby baby
That kind of love can only destroy
I gave her maybe maybe
Get it down if Im gonna be her baby cos baby
Gonna be me its gonna be me
There was no rein to check me
When all of those little things walked on by
Oh but I couldnt really stammer out a word
When that angel stuck in my mind
Looking for love wont hold me back
No Im gonna love her way
Come back my babe
Come back my babe
Be holy again I gave her
I gave her maybe maybe
Maybe gotta give her ooh baby baby baby
That kind of love can only destroy
I gave her maybe maybe
Get it down if Im gonna be her baby cos baby
Gonna be me its gonna be me
Just playing that latest record
Waiting for the telephone to ring
Wiped out and bitter with a bag clutched in her hand
All the cars sound like theyre pulling in the drive
No no no
I see her now a little tear running down her cheek
Lost let down people looking for me
I want to race down her street
And knock hard
Hard hard on the door until
Until she breaks down into my arms like a
Treasured toy and I feel her pain
Ill be so strong again and again
Come back my baby

Ill take you baby baby baby
Baby were gonna have ooh baby baby baby
My kind of love can only bring you joy Im gonna
Yeah baby baby yeah Ill give you baby baby baby
Cos its gonna be me its gonna be meWar made him a soldier
Little Frankie Mear
Peace left him a loser
The little bombardier
Lines of worry appeared with age
Unskilled hands that knew no trade
Spent his time in the picture house
The little bombardier
Frankie drank his money
The little that he made
Told his woes to no man
Friendless lonely days
Then one day in the ABC
Four bright eyes gazed longingly
At the ice-cream in the hand of
The little bombardier
Sunshine entered our Frankies days
Gone his worries his hopeless maze
His life was fun and his heart was full of joy
Two young children had changed his aims
He gave them toffees and played their games
He brought them presents with every coin he made
Then two gentlemen called on him
Asked him for his name
Why was he friends with the children
Were they just a game
Leave them alone or well get sore
Weve had blokes like you in the station before
The hand of authority said no more
To the little bombardier
Packed his bags his heart in pain
Wiped a tear and caught a train
Not to be seen in the town again
The little bombardierWhen people call us revolutionary
Theyre just tryin to see
All that we choose
When all we want is everybody free
The universe would be one brotherhood
It isnt wrong to be prepared to fight
Together to unite if we believe
In giving everything our heart and soul
Until we reach the goal we should achieve
It shouldnt matter if were brown or white
Yellow or black as night to anyone
Were all born equal with the self same rights
Sharing the same daylight under the sunFame makes a man take things over
Fame lets him loose hard to swallow
Fame puts you there where things are hollow fame
Fame its not your brain its just the flame
That burns your change to keep you insane fame
Fame fame what you like is in the limo
Fame fame what you get is no tomorrow
Fame fame what you need you have to borrow Fame

The last days were the meanest
Leanest days of our lives

Windows and wifes
No bedroom to run too

Monkeys made of gingerbread

Their fathers dressed in hose
Golden hair and mud of many acres on their shoes
Gazing eyes and running wild
Past the stocks and over stiles
Kiss the window merry child
But come and buy my toys
Youve watched your father plough the fields with a rams horn
Sowed it wide with peppercorn and furrowed with a bramble thorn
Reaped it with a sharpened scyth thrashed it with a quill
The miller told your father that hed work it with the greatest will
Now your watchings over you must play with girls and boys
Leave the parsley on the stalls
Come and buy my toys
You shall own a cambric shirt
You shall work your fathers land
But now you shall play in the market square
Till youll be a manTheres a brand new dance

They do it over there but we dont do it here

Only fool turns around
And you will fight with demons
And we shall go to town
And you will wear youre best shoes
And well dance if we dont go down
And well dance if we dont go downTheres a little churchyard just along the way
It used to be Lambeths finest array
Of tombstones epitaphs wreaths flowers all that jazz
Til the war came along and someone dropped a bomb on the lot
And in this little yard theres a little old man
With a little shovel in his little bitty hand
He seems to spend all his days puffing fags and digging graves
He hates the reverend vicar and he lives all alone in his home
Ah-choo excuse me
Please Mr Gravedigger dont feel ashamed
As you dig little holes for the dead and the maimed
Please Mr Gravedigger I couldnt care
If you found a golden locket full of some girls hair
And you put it in your pocket
God its pouring down
Her mother doesnt know about your sentimental joy
She thinks its down below with the rest of her toys
And Ma wouldnt understand so I wont tell
So keep your golden locket all safely hid away in your pocket
Yes Mr GD you see me every day
Standing in the same spot by a certain grave
Mary-Ann was only ten full of life and oh so gay
And I was the wicked man who took her life away
Very selfish Oh God
No Mr GD you wont tell
And just to make sure that you keep it to yourself
Ive started digging holes myself
And this one heres for you
Lifted our girl she apparently doesnt know of it
Hello misses thought shed be a little girl
Bloody obscene catch pneumonia or something in this rainSpace boy youre sleepy now
Your silhouette is so stationary
Youre released but your custody calls
And I want to be free
Dont you want to be free
Do you like girls or boys
Its confusing these days
But moon dust will cover you cover you
This chaos is killing me
Bye bye love
This chaos is killing meThere was a time the laughing time
I took my heart to every party
Theyd point my way
how are you today
will you make us laugh chase our blues away
Their funny man wont let them down
No hed dance and prance and be their clown
That time the laughing time
When even a fool learns to love
The clown turned around
And saw her smile oh how she loved me
Shed clap her hands and beg me stay
To make her laugh to make her life gay
Who wants the love of all the world
When here was love in the eyes of just one girl
That day that precious day
When even a fool learns to love
But oh how I dreamed a marvelous dream
Where all of the heavens or so it had seemed
With thunderous applause looked down from above
On a clown and an angel so much in love
Ill stay with my dream it takes such a dream
And even a fool learns to love
That day that hateful day
The joke turned stale the game was over
Those spiteful words oh go away who wants to play
its getting late now
My world my funny world
Had lost its mask and shown a broken heart
A time a sour time
When even a fool learns to loveRamona is so cold
When she broke it off with Leon
She said The ring is enough
I dont wanna see his face again
Ramona was so coldDont look back
Whatever it takes to save your life
Ive believed i belonged to you for a long time
And my heart says no no one but you
Like a rescue on a darkened street
Love walked into town
I was a victim of my own self-persecution
Im a prisoner of love-but im coming up for air
Now dont be fooled by fools who promise you
The world and all that glitters more fool you
Im such a hungry man that i beg you over and over and over and over
And i might take any highway to be there with you
Even the best men shiver in their beds
Im loving you above everything i have
Im a prisoner of love-just stay square
Like a sermon on a blues guitar
Love walked into town
I was drowning so slowly
One step in front of your shadow
Im a prisoner of love but Im coming up for air
Now dont be fooled by fools who promise you
The world and all that glitters more fool you
I smell the sickness sown in this city
It drives me to hide you yeah even deceive you
Im so afraid for you that
Ill break any thug that maps out your passage to ruin
Even the best men shiver in their beds
Im loving you above everything i have
Im a prisoner of love
Im a prisoner of love-just stay square
Take care take care
Im a prisoner of love
Just stay square
Just stay square
Stay out the shooting gallery
Just stay square

Youre bruised and bewildered

Dont sit down

On a gemini spacecraft
And I thought about you
I passed through the shadow of jupiter
And I thought about you
I shot my spacegun
And boy I really felt blue
Two or three flying saucers
Parked under the stars
The winding stream
Moon shining down
On some little town
And with each beam
The same old dream
I took a trip
On a gemini spacecraft
And I thought about you
I shot my spacegun
And I thought about you
I pulled down my sun visor
Boy I really felt blue
You jumped into your gemini
I jumped into mine
Well orbit the moon
For just one time
Tomorrow night
Tomorrow night
Will you hold hands
With me in the moonlight
I took a trip
In a gemini spacecraft
And I thought about you
I shot my spacegun
And I thought about you
I took
I took a walk in space
Boy I really felt blue
Well I peeked through the crack
And I looked way back
The stardust trail
Leading back to you
What did I do
What could I do
Yes what did I do
Well
I thought about you
I thought about you
Took a trip
On a gemini spacecraft
Thought about youBetween the dead ring ash of extreme defense
The lonely groups of company boys snapping pics
Of scrawny limbs and toothy grins
These are children riding naked on their tourist pals
While the hollows that pass for eyes swell from withdrawal
As he lies on a mattress in a rat infested room
Talking bout his family and the cold back home
Between the dull cold eyes and the mind unstable
No one over here reads the papers pal
Between the dull cold eyes and the mind unstable
Hes a clean trick and hes shopping for girls
A small black someone jumps over the crazy white god
Cranking up the volume on a Michael Jackson song
Between the dull cold eyes and the mind unstable
No one over here reads the papers pal
Between the dull cold eyes and the mind unstable
Where the frangipani scents the air
She mouths a word that breaks his stare
He grunts his reply in a garrulous croak
Thats a mighty big word for a nine year old
Between the dull cold eyes and the mind unstable
No one over here reads the papers pal
Between the dull cold eyes and the mind unstable
You gaze down in to her eyes for a million miles
You want to give her a name and a clean rag dollValentines Day twenty-five June sixteenth Wednesday July sixth twenty zero twenty fifteen

I will wash my face me hands all by myself
When Im five
I will chew and spit tabacco like my grandfather jones
cause Im only four and five is far away
When Im five
I will read the magazines in mummys drawer
When Im five
I will walk behind the soldiers in the may day parade
cause Im only four and grown-ups walk too fast
Yesterday was horrid day cause raymond kicked my shin
And mummy says if I am good shell let me go to school in August
Daddy shouted loud at mummy and I dropped my toast at breakfast
And I laughed when bonzo licked my face because it tickled
I wonder why my daddy cries and how I wish that I was nearly five
When Im five
I will catch a butterfly and eat it and I wont be sick
When Im five
I will jump in puddles laugh in church and marry my mum
And Ill let my daddy do the washing-up
If I close one eye the people on that side cant see me
I get headaches in the morning and I rode on freddies tricycle
And everywhere was funny when I ran down to the sweetshop
Then I fell and bleeded-up my knee and everybody soppied me
I saw a photograph of jesus and I asked him if hed make me five
I saw a photograph of jesus and I asked him if hed make me five

When Im oahIn the port of Amsterdam
Theres a sailor who sings
Of the dreams that he brings
From the wide open sea
In the port of Amsterdam
Theres a sailor who sleeps
While the river bank weeps
To the old Willow tree
In the port of Amsterdam
Theres a sailor who dies
Full of beer full of cries
In a drunken town fight
In the port of Amsterdam
Theres a sailor whos born
On a hot muggy morn
By the dawns early light
In the port of Amsterdam
Where the sailors all meet
Theres a sailor who eats
Only fish heads and tails
And hell show you his teeth
That have rotted too soon
That can haul up the sails
That can swallow the moon
And he yells to the cook
With his arms open wide
Hey bring me more fish
Throw it down by my side
And he wants so to belch
But hes too full to try
So he stands up and laughs
And he zips up his fly
In the port of Amsterdam
You can see sailors dance
Paunches bursting their pants
Grinding women to porch
Theyve forgotten the tune
That their whiskey voice croaked
Splitting the night
With the roar of their jokes
And they turn and they dance
And they laugh and they lust
Till the rancid sound of the accordion bursts
And then out of the night
With their pride in their pants
And the sluts that they tow
Underneath the street lamp
In the port of Amsterdam
Theres a sailor who drinks
And he drinks and he drinks
And he drinks once again
Hell drink to the health
Of the whores of Amsterdam
Whove given their bodies
To a thousand other men
Yeah theyve bargained their virtue
Their goodness all gone
For a few dirty coins
When he just cant go on
Throws his nose to the sky
Aims it up above
And he pisses like I cry
On the unfaithful love
In the port of Amsterdam
In the port of AmsterdamMy death waits like an old rouÃ
So confident Ill go his way
Whistle to him and the passing time
My death waits like a bible truth
At the funeral of my youth
Weep loud for that and the passing time
My death waits like a witch at night
As surely as our love is bright
Lets not think about the passing time
Chorus
But what ever lies behind the door
There is nothing much to do
Angel or devil I dont care
For in front of that door there is you
My death waits like a beggar blind
Who sees the world through an unlit mind
Throw him a dime for the passing time
My death waits there between your thighs
Your cool fingers will close my eyes
Lets not think of that and the passing time
My death waits to allow my friends
A few good times before it ends
So lets drink to that and the passing time
Chorus
My death waits there among the leaves
In magicians mysterious sleeves
Rabbits and dogs and the passing time
My death waits there among the flowers
Where the blackest shadow blackest shadow cowers
Lets pick lilacs for the passing time
My death waits there in a double bed
Sails of oblivion at my head
So pull up the sheets against the passing time
ChorusTranslation by mia berg
Schan aus deinen fenster schau wer draussen sitzt
Ich bin hier wartet schon die ganze nacht
Wenn du dann dein haus verlaesst winke ich und ruft
Ah ha wunder schoenes maedchen
Mein brennend verlangen er wartet am montag
Gib mir dein herz und lieb mich bis dienstag
Da da da dum
Da da da dum
Whos that hiding in the apple tree clinging to a branch
Dont be afraid its only me hoping for a little romance
If you lie beneath my shade Ill keep you nice and cool
Ohh beautiful baby
I was very lonely till I met you on sunday
My passions never-ending and Ill love you till tuesday
Da da da dum
Da da da dum
Da da da dum
Da da da dum
Let the wind blow through your hair be nice to the big blue sea
Dont be afraid of the man in the moon because its only me
I shall always watch you until my love runs dry
Ohh beautiful baby
My hearts a flame Ill love you till tuesday
My heads in a whirl and Ill love you till tuesday

Na ja vieleicht wird sie auch mittwochOh my love Janine
Im helpless for your smile
Like a Polish wander
I travel ever onwards to your land
And were it not just for the jewels Id close your hand
Your strange demand
To collocate my mind
Scares me into gloom
Youre too intense
Ill have to keep you in your place
Ive no defense
Ive got to keep my veil on my face
Janine Janine youd like to know me well
But Ive got things inside my head
That even I cant face
Janine Janine youd like to crash my walls

Dance magic dance dance magic danceHeres the town in which I live petunia green
Heres the shop and heres the man who sold me laces for my shoes
There is mrmarcus boys they say hes mad
heres the battle that they won silver treetop school for boys
Early days were good as gold
An apple here an apple there
And everywhere a yes sir no sir
They made me roll the cricket pitch once a day
Ive never been so happy than at silver treetop school for boys
The mowing machine was leaving small piles of grass
That when the had risen to the pipe of mrmarcus
The smell of teaching fell upon the cricket field
Smiling laughing rolling about at silver treetop school for boys
Hey there
They call in the staff room
They call in the canteen
hey come and look at what I found
i found some boys and masters sitting
On the cricket ground at silver treetop school for boysWas walking through the counters of a national concern
And a cash machine was spitting by my shoulder
And I saw the multitude of faces honest rich and clean
As the merchandise exchanged and money roared
And a woman hot with worry slyly slipped a tin of stewing steak
Into the paper bag at her side
And her face was white with fear in case her actions were observed
So she closed her eyes to keep her conscience blind
Crying
God knows Im good
God knows Im good
God knows Im good
God may look the other way today
God knows Im good
God knows Im good
God knows Im good
God may look the other way today
Then she moved toward the exit clutching tightly at her paper bag
Perspiration trickled down her forehead
And her heart it leapt inside her as the hand laid on her shoulder
She was led away bewildered and amazed
Through her deafened ears the cash machines were shrieking on the counter
As her escort asked her softly
For her name
And a crowd of honest people rushed to help a tired old lady
Who had fainted to the whirling
Wooden floor
Crying
God knows Im good
God knows Im good
God knows Im good
Surely God wont look
The other way
God knows Im good
God knows Im good
God knows Im good
Surely God wont look
The other wayAs soon as youre born they make you feel small
By giving you no time instead of it all
Till the pain is so big you feel nothing at all
A working class hero is something to be
A working class hero is something to be
They hurt you at home and they hit you at school
They hate you if your clever and they despise a fool
Till youre so fucking crazy you cant fallow their rules
A working class hero is something to be
A working class hero is something to be
When theyve tortured and scared you for twenty odd years
Ah then they expect you to pick a career
When you cant really function youre so full of fear
A working class hero is something to be
A working class hero is something to be
Keep you doped wit religion and sex and TV
And you think youre so clever and classless and free
But youre still fucking peasants as far as I can see
A working class hero is something to be
A working class hero is something to be
Theres room at the top they are telling you still
But first you must smile as you kill
But if you want to be like the folks on the hill
A working class hero is something to be
A working class hero is something to be
If you want to be a hero well just follow me
If you want to be a hero well just follow me
Just follow meOver the wall we go
All coppers are nanas
Over the wall we go
Leave him a note saying Wish you was here
I know the best ways to break out of here
I helped a young laddie called Ivan
Over the wall last night
Then he climbed back and he grabbed me tight
He uttered some words that I cant say to you
Cause he remembered that he was a screw
Over the wall we go
All coppers are nanas
Over the wall we go
Leave him a note wishing Happy New Year
My name is Henry
Some say Im thick
Ive spent half me life in and out of nick
Me mum sends me presents to keep me in style
Soggy old cakes and hundreds of files
God sussed all them files
Im a clever young man
Now Im just stupid with manicured hands
Over the wall we go
All coppers are nanas
Over the wall we go
Nobodys left and the screws are in tears

He went out for a cup of tea at the local football match sir
Oh well he might have invited me
Over the wall we go
All coppers are nanas
Over the wall we go
Nobodys left and the screws are in tears
We tried digging tunnels but gave up the ghost
Just past the Kensington Yards at the most
Our limbs was aching we felt pretty pooped
Our clothes they was tatty our hallows did droop
We crawled back to safety our hearts filled with gloom
Cause wed dug ourselves through to the smallest room
Over the wall we go
All coppers are nanas
Over the wall we go
Leave him a note wishing Happy New Year

Is delay just wasting my time
Looking across at Richard rogers
Scheming dreams to blow both their minds
Its difficult you see
To give up baby
To leave a job
When you know the moneys from day to day
All the majesty of a city landscape
All the soaring days of our lives
All the concrete dreams in my minds eye
All the joy i see through these architects eyes
Cold winter bleeds on the girders of babel
This stone boy watching the crawling land
Rings of flesh and the towers of iron
The steaming caves and rocks and the sand
Stomping along on this big Philips Johnson
Is delay just wasting my time
Its difficult you see
To give up baby
These summer scumholes
This goddamned starving life
All the majesty of a city landscape
All the soaring days of our lives
All the concrete dreams in my minds eye
All the joy i see through these architects eyes
Its difficult you see
Its difficult you see
All the majesty of a city landscape
All the soaring days in our lives
All the concrete dreams in my minds eye
All the joy i see through these architects eyesWar made him a soldier
Little Frankie Mear
Peace left him a loser
The little bombardier
Lines of worry appeared with age
Unskilled hands that knew no trade
Spent his time in the picture house
The little bombardier
Frankie drank his money
The little that he made
Told his woes to no man
Friendless lonely days
Then one day in the ABC
Four bright eyes gazed longinly
At the ice-cream in the hand of
The little bombardier
Sunshine entered our Frankies days
Gone his worries his hopeless maze
His life was fun and his life was full of joy
Two young children had changed his aims
He gave them toffees and played their games
He brought them presents with every coins he made
Then two gentlemen called him
Asked him for his name
Why was he friends with the children
Were they just a game
Leave them alone or well get sore
Weve had blokes like you in the station before
The hand of authority said no more to
The little bombardier
Packed his bags his heart in pain
Wiped a tear caught a train
Not to be seen in the town againWhen you speak you speak to me
When you sleep you sleep by me
When you wake you wake with me
When you walk you follow two steps behind in life
Shadows stalking ever grasping sinking for a need
It wasnt love it was the fix of never wanting me
Now Im gone youre tossing and you turning in your sleep
Thats the name of the game of the game of the game
Cry Miss Peculiar
Youll cry all the more now Im gone
I was the monkey on your back
Take a look at how lucky you are
When you speak you speak to me
When you sleep you sleep by me
When you wake you wake with me
When you walk you follow two steps behind
Cry cry Miss Peculiar
Youll cry all the more now Im gone
I was the monkey on your back
Take a look at how lucky you are
Some days are heaven I will not deny
Probing the daylight cascading the skyline
Tripping and diving and losing it all
Back came the night time living for more
Cry cry Miss Peculiar
Youll cry all the more now that Im gone
I was the devil monkey on your back
Take a look at how lucky you are
When you speak you speak to me
When you sleep you sleep by me
When you wake you wake with me
When you walk you follow two steps behind
La La La La LaSome days he feels so empty just a talking head
Married to a Klingon whod cream him in the press
God could detonate him Gods the one we pick to curse us
And twenty-five years pass him like an evening at the circus
Dont sacrifice yourself dont sacrifice yourself
Surprise yourself dont sacrifice yourself
Dont sacrifice yourself dont sacrifice yourself
There it is the look the winner you once talked of being
Give her one last kiss and dive right out the window screaming
No truth decent it was summer from the waist down
She blew the troops right off your feet tells you shes Gods Grammy
Dont sacrifice yourself dont sacrifice yourself
Surprise yourself dont sacrifice yourself
Dont sacrifice yourself dont sacrifice yourself
Her the only game in town a queen of competence
Blind in front of mirrors proving nothing says a lot
Wham bam thank you Charles vanity is all
You wander lonely to the scene a-crawling up the walls
Dont sacrifice yourselfI took this walk to ease my mind
To find out whats gnawing at me
And wouldnt think to look at me
That Ive spent a lot of time in education
All seems so long ago
Im a thinker not a talker
Ive no-one to talk to anyway
I cant see the road
For the rain in my eyes
I live above the grocers store
Owned by an Austrian
He often calls me down to eat
And he jokes about his broken English
Tries to be a friend to me
But for all my years of reading conversation
I stand without a word to say
I cant see the bridge
For the rain in my eyes
And the world is full of life
Full of folk who dont know me
And they walk in twos or threes or more
While the light that shines above the grocers store
Investigates my face so rudely
And my essays lying scattered on the floor
Fulfill their needs just by being there
And my hands shake my head hurts
My voice sticks inside my throat
Im invisible and dumb and no one will recall me
And I cant see the water through the tears in my eyesTest testing testing
This hmm Grace is my name and and I was hm
It was that phot a fading photograph of
A patch a patchwork quilt
And theyve put me on these
Ramona put me on these interest drugs
So Im thinking very too bit too fast like a brain hatch
And ah they wont let me see anybody
If I want to sometimes and I ask
I can still hear some pop popular musics and aftershocks
Ive been watching a television of um in the homelands
Thats the new homelands and um and thats all I can remember
And now they just want me to be quiet
And I think something is going to be horridNow we can talk in confidence
Did you guess that weve been done wrong
Lies jumped the queue to be first in line
Such a shameless design
He thinks hes well screened from the man at the top
Its a shame that his children disagree
They coolly decide to sell him down the line
Daddys brainwashing time
Hes a dodo no no didnt hear it from me
Hes a dodo no no didnt hear it from me
Shes quite enthralled with the childhood of yore
When a unit was a figure not a she
When lovers chose each other now the perks are due
Another memo to screw
Shes a dodo no no didnt hear it from me
Shes a dodo no no didnt hear it from me
Can you wipe your nose my child
Without them slotting in your file a photograph
Can you sleep alone at night
Wake to find the scorching light of neighbor Jim
Hes come to turn you in
Another dodo no no didnt hear it from me
Another dodo no no didnt hear it from me
Another dodo didnt hear it from meSkeletal city highs
Crazies with dumb replies
Nobodys eyes anymore
Frown on your beggars face
Walking this lunarscape
Nothing in my lackaday
CHORUS
Well all be right
Well all be right
Well all be right in the now
We all go through
We all go through
We all go through it sometimes
Somebodys space to rent
Somebodys soul to dent
Dog is in every word
Hiding the flames of power
Hiding us home by home
Nearly got out yesterday
CHORUS
Trouble it travels on the wing
Doorway to door
Open your eyes
Nothing remains
A secret love between us
Nothing can hide for long
We are the morning song
Holding my breath anyway
CHORUS Black eyed ravens
They spiral down
They tilt his head back
To the flame filled sunset
Raise their guns high
As the darken falls
These are the days boys
Shallow man
Shallow man and they
Eats in the doorway
With his head inclined
And hes always in decline
No-one heals anymore
So he shrinks as they ride
Under vermillion sky
So it goes
Just a searcher
A lonely soul
The last of the dreamers
Shallow man
Shallow man
Speaks to the shadows
Moves his trembling hands
And hes always a little late
For the dawning of the dayRubber Band
Theres a rubber band that plays tunes out of tune
In the library garden Sunday afternoon
While a little chappie waves a golden wand
Rubber Band
In one thousand, nine hundred and ten I was so handsome and so strong
My moustache was stiffly waxed and one foot long
And I loved a girl while you played teatime tunes
Dear Rubber Band youre playing my tune out of tune oh
Rubber Band
Wont you play a haunting theme again to me
While I eat my scones and drink my cup of tea
The sun is warm but its a lonely afternoon
Oh play that theme
Rubber Band
How I wish that I could join your Rubber Band
We could play in lively parks throughout the land
And one Sunday afternoon Id find my love
Rubber Band
In the fourteen-eighteen war I went to sea
Thought my Sunday love was waiting home for me
And now shes married to the leader of the band oh

My studies included suffragy
I formed my own society
to study the power of fecundity
The world will overpopulate
Unless you claim infertility
So who will buy a drink for me your messiah
We are not your friends
We dont give a damn for what youre saying
Were here to live our lives
I propose to give the pill
Free of charge to those that feel
That they are not infertible
The crops of few the cattle gun
Theres only one way to linger on
So who will buy a drink for me your messiah
We are not your friends
We dont give a damn for what youre saying
Were here to live our lives
Achtung achtung these are your orders
Anyone found guilty of consuming more than their allotted amount of air
Will be slaughtered and cremated

We will turn a blind eye to infanticide
We are not your friends
We dont give a damn for what youre saying
Were here to live our lives
You dont seem to hear me clear
Do I talk above your sphere
Let me explain my project dear
Show you how Ill save the world
Or let it die within the year
Why do you look that way at me your messiah
We are not your friends
We dont give a damn for what youre saying
Were here to live our lives
We are hungry men
We dont give a damn for what youre saying
Were here to eat youI dont want knowledge

In the street a man shouts out loud
A wallet drops and money flies
Into the midday sun

With the sound with the sound
With the sound of the ground
Oh I get a little bit

And stare at the sun
Till my eyes burn
I shake
At the mothers brutal vermin
I shake
And stare at the watery moon
With the same desire
As the sober Philistine
And I shake
Turn and turn again
Worm the pain and blade
Turn and turn again
The screw
Is a tightening Atrocity
I shake
For the reeking flesh
Is as romantic as hell
The need
To have seen it all
The Voyeur of Utter Destruction
As beauty
I shake
Turn and turn again
I shake
Turn and turn again
I shake
I shake

Threepenny pierrot - loves us too
Pockets of gladness gay time eyes
Comical hero threepenny pierrot
Happy little feet that dance all day
Lonely little heart with lots to say
Stepping footprints on your mind
Offering thoughts of columbine
Bang the drum and blow the bugle call
Pierrot takes the stage to play for all
For heres a life his fortune rules
Forsaken by his columbine
Threepenny pierrot - we love you
Threepenny pierrot - loves us too
Pockets of gladness gay time eyes
Comical hero threepenny pierrot
To tap his feet to greet dear harlequin
The hearts of folks so keenly hard to win
A patchwork frame of tears and wine
The nectar for cruel columbine
The part of three and leaves the stage forlorn
Puppets cold their faces sad and drawn
Relive each trial of rise and fall
The love which lacks between us all
Threepenny pierrot - we love you
Threepenny pierrot - loves us too
Pockets of gladness gay time eyes
Comical hero threepenny pierrot
Threepenny pierrot - we love you
Threepenny pierrot - loves us too
Pockets of gladness gay time eyes
Comical hero threepenny pierrotIn the port of Amsterdam theres a sailor who sings
Of the dreams that he brings from the wide open sea
In the port of Amsterdam theres a sailor who sleeps
While the river bank weeps to the old willow tree
In the port of Amsterdam theres a sailor who dies
Full of beer full of cries in a drunken town fight
In the port of Amsterdam theres a sailor whos born
On a hot muggy morn by the dawns early light
In the port of Amsterdam where the sailors all meet
Theres a sailor who eats only fish heads and tails
And hell show you his teeth that have rotted too soon
That can haul up the sails that can swallow the moon
And he yells to the cook with his arms open wide
Hey bring me more fish throw it down by my side
And he wants so to belch but hes too full to try
So he stands up and laughs and he zips up his fly
In the port of Amsterdam you can see sailors dance
Paunches bursting their pants grinding women to porch
Theyve forgotten the tune that their whiskey voice croaked
Splitting the night with the roar of their jokes
And they turn and they dance and they laugh and they lust
Till the rancid sound of the accordion bursts
And then out of the night with their pride in their pants
And the sluts that they tow underneath the street lamps
In the port of Amsterdam theres a sailor who drinks
And he drinks and he drinks and he drinks once again
Hell drink to the health of the whores of Amsterdam
Whove given their bodies to a thousand other men
Yeah theyve bargained their virtue their goodness all gone
For a few dirty coins well he just cant go on
Throws his nose to the sky and he aims it up above
And he pisses like I cry on the unfaithful love
In the port of Amsterdam
In the port of AmsterdamShes just been to russia and theyre dying their faces
Theyre dying over there
A pretty pink rose
That rnr lady takes a space-ship ride shes out of this world
A pretty pink rose
And were living for you my love were living for you

Pretty pink rose
She tore down paris on the tall of thom paine

A pretty pink rose
And were living for you my love were living for you
And were dying for you my love
Pretty pink rose

Flying in the face of the despot cannible
Shes a pretty pink rose
Never let it rain never let it rain on the heart of the pretty pink rose
Pretty pink rose
And were living for you my love were living for you
And were dying for you my love pretty pink rose
Get me thru the pain thru the pain of the thorn on the pretty pink rose
Never let it rain never rain never rain the pretty pink rose

Take me to the heart to the heart to the heart
Take me to the heart to the heart to the heart of the pretty pink rose
Take me to the heart to the heart to the heart
Take me to the heart to the heart to the heart of the pretty pink rose
Take me to the heart to the heart to the heartNothing on smoke today
Nothing dies on the wing
Wings been losing time
An anarchy born in pain
Pain that comes and goes
It goes against all you see
You see I got gables eyes
And eisenhower blames the poor
The poor huddled on the curb
Gotta get back in shape
Were backing up a major plan
Were treading on lights
Were walking under golden sun
Were living in a planet of dreams
Were living in a planet of dreams
Were living in a planet of dreams
Were living in a planet of dreams
Were living in a planet of dreams
Were living in a planet
five more times
Do do do doI shake
And stare at the sun
Till my eyes burn
I shake
At the mothers brutal vermin
I shake
And stare at the watery moon
With the same desire
As the sober Philistine
And I shake
Turn and turn again
Worm the pain and blade
Turn and turn again
The screw
Is a tightening Atrocity
I shake
For the reeking flesh
Is as romantic as hell
The need
To have seen it all
The Voyeur of Utter Destruction
As beauty
I shake
Turn and turn again
I shake
Turn and turn again
I shake
I shake
I shake
Research has pierced
All extremes of my sex
Call it a day
Call it a day
Needle point life
Blinds the will to be next
Call it a day
Call it a day
TodayThese are silver wings
These are golden eyes
These are floating clouds
Angel for love
Dreaming alone and I feel this someone
Someone
Listens to me
Listens to me
Angel for love
These are silver wings
These are golden eyes
These are floating clouds
Angel for love
Heaven is smiling down heavens girl in a wedding gown
I never gonna be so good
Just like a good brochure
Im gonna change my way
Angel for love
Of all the saints alive
Dont I feel like a saint alive
Shes not mine for eternity
Though Ill never fly so high
I smiling
I believe in the magic
Angel for love
In the magic
Angel for love
I believe in magic
Angel for love
In the magic
Angel for love
I believe in the magicInstrumentalStrikes the bell for five oclock Uncle Arthur closes shop
Screws the tops on all the bottles turns the lights out locks it up
Climbs across his bike and hes away
Cycles past the gasworks past the river down the high street
Back to mother its another empty day
Uncle Arthur likes his mommy
Uncle Arthur still reads comics
Uncle Arthur follows Batman
Round and round the rumours fly how he ran away from Mum
On his thirty-twond birthday told her that hed found a chum
Mother cried and raved and yelled and fussed
Arthur left her no illusion brought the girl round save confusion
Sally was the real thing not just lust
Uncle Arthur vanished quickly
Uncle Arthur and his new bride
Uncle Arthur follows Sally
Round and round goes Arthurs head hasnt eaten well for days
Little Sally may be lovely but cooking leaves her in a maze
Uncle Arthur packed his bags and fled
Back to mother alls forgiven serving in the family shop
He gets his pocket money hes well fed
Uncle Arthur past the gasworks
Uncle Arthur past the river
Uncle Arthur down the high street
Uncle Arthur follows motherCruising around me
The flames burn my body
Wishful beginnings
Does this remind them again and again
Youre a sorry little girl
Youre a sorry little girl
Please hide
For the pain must feel
Like snow
Youre a sorry little girl
Sorry little girl
Please hide from the kiss and the bite
Shame burns
Breathing in breathing out
Breathing in only doubt
The pain must feel like snow
Im no longer your golden boy
Sorry little girl
Im sorry little girl
The pain must feel like snow
There you go
Cover me cover me
We flew on the wings
We were deep in the dead air
And this one will never go down
We had such
Wishful beginnings
But we lived
Unbearable lives
Im sorry little girl
Sorry little girl
So so sorry little girlI stood stone-like at midnight suspended in my masquerade
I combed my hair till it was just right and commanded the night brigade
I was open to pain and crossed by the rain and I walked on a crooked crutch
I strolled all alone through a fallout zone and came out with my soul untouched
I hid in the clouded wrath of the crowd but when they said Sit down I stood up
Ooh-ooh growin up
The flag of piracy flew from my mast my sails were set wing to wing
I had a jukebox graduate for first mate she couldnt sail but she sure could sing
I pushed be	-fifty-two and bombed em with the blues with my gear set stubborn on standing
I broke all the rules strafed my old high school never once gave thought to landing
I hid in the clouded wrath of the crowd but when they said Come down I threw up
Ooh-ooh growin up
I took month-long vacations in the stratosphere and you know its really hard to hold your breath
I swear I lost everything I ever loved or feared I was the cosmic kid in full costume dress
Well my feet they finally took root in the earth but I got me a nice little place in the stars
And I swear I found the key to the universe in the engine of an old parked car
I hid in the mother breast of the crowd but when they said Pull down I pulled up
Ooh-ooh growin up Ooh-ooh growin upAnd as the sparrow sings
Dawn chorus for
Someone else to hear
The thinker sits alone growing older
And so bitter
She gave them life
She gave them all
They drained her very soul drydry
Hey hey hey bitter girl
Were out to sitting here digging you
We flew done here just to figure you
Its easy
Dont be so bitter
Oh oh oh crazy girl
You gave too much and you got nothing
Too many problems and not one thing
In return
Left high and dry
Door
And as the sun rise stream
Flickers on
She finds lavender
To fight the beckoningWash your face before your faded make-up makes a mark
The mirror will watch over you
Pierrot never comes so pack your face and chase the dark
The mirrors hung up on you
Dont be last your friends and your reflection
Its all so direction now
Poor harlequin youre quite an exception
Fay troubadour on a downer
Gay harlequin doesnt believe in you
Doesnt believe its true such a downerBurning up each others love burning up our lives
Tried all kinds of working out miracle goodnight
Future full and empty knocking on my door
Ragged limbed and hungry mama
Miracle no more
Skin tell me turn it around
Head tell me make it alright
Nobody dancing
Morning star youre beautiful yellow dime on high
Spin you round my little room miracle goodnight
Evening flower all alone puzzling capeche
Havent got a death wish just want a little more
CHORUS
Skin tell me turn it around
Head tell me make it alright
Nobody dancing miracle goodnight
Breath tell me turn it around
Heart tell me make it alright
Nobody dancing it was only make believe
I wish I was a sailor a thousand miles from here
I wished I had a future anywhere
I love you in the morning sun I love you in my dreams
I love the sound of making love the feeling of your skin
The corner of your eyes I long forevermore
I never want to say goodnight miracle goodnight
Chorus
Dont want to know the past I want to know the real deal
I really dont want to know that
The less we know the better we feel
Morning star youre beautiful yellow diamond high
Spinning around my little room miracle
Chorus
Skin tell me turn it around
Moon tell me make it alright
Nobody dancing it was only make believe
Eyes tell me turn it around
News tell me make it alright
Nobody dancing
ChorusSilhouettes and shadows watch the revolution
No more free steps to heaven
Just walkie-talkie Heaven or Earth
Just big heads and drums
Full speed and pagan and its no game
I am barred from the event
I really dont understand the situation
So wheres the moral
People have their fingers broken
To be insulted by these fascists
Is so degrading and its no game
Documentaries on refugees couples gainst the target
Throw a rock against the road and it breaks into pieces
Draw the blinds on yesterday and its all so much scarier
Put a bullet in my brain and it makes all the papers and its no gameSkin dance back-a-the condo
Skin heads getting to school
Beating on blacks with a baseball bat
Racism back in rule
White trash picking up Nazi flags
While you was gone there was war
This is the west get used to it
They put a Swastika over the door
Under the God under the God
One step over the red line
Under the God under the God
Ten steps into the crazy crazy
Washington heads in the toilet bowl
Dont see supremacist hate
Right wing dicks in their boiler suits
Picking out who to annihilate
Toxic jungle of Uzi trails
Tribesmen just wouldnt live here
Fascist flare is fashion cool
Well youre dead you just aint buried yet
Under the God under the God
Under the God under the God
As the walls came tumbling down
So the secrets that we shared
I believed you by the palace gates
Now the savage days are here
Under the God
Under the God under the God
One step over the red line
Under the God under the God
One steps into the crazy crazy
Crazy eyed man with a shot gun
Hot headed creep with a knife
Love and peace and harmony
Love you could cut with a knife
Under the God under the God
Under the God under the GodYou have loved me with energy
Backed up with hard work and guts
We inhabit eternity
We fly forever in space
The way we run together
The way we breeze the miles
We put our heads together
And laughingly we smile
It cant fall
It cant fall
Baby it cant fall
Death means nothing at all
It cant fall
It cant fall
Baby it cant fall
Our love will outlive this earth
Words have so many meanings
Sometimes mean nothing at all
Sometimes I feel so simple
I dont know whats coming next
We have swum in the ocean
And that was really alright
Im not a big man
Its hard to face the world
It cant fall
It cant fall
Baby it cant fall
Death means nothing at all
It cant fall
It cant fall
Baby it cant fall
Our love will outlive this earth
It cant fallHey hey its the tall sail on a beach reach for Java
Make way for to Java watching for Boogies
Hey hey its a dreaming I would burn you if you should die
Hey hey I should burn too if you should lie upon that bamboo pyre
I dream of Amlapura never saw in all my life a more shining jewel
I dream of Amlapura of an ocean or dream of a princess in stone
Hey hey golden roses around a rajahs mouth
Hey hey all the dead children buried standing
A flying dutchman smoking gun and spice wind
I dream of Amlapura never saw in all my life a more shining jewel
I dream of Amlapura of an ocean or dream of a princess in stoneWhilst flying through an azure cloud
A crystal girl id spy
She kissed the blue birds honey tongue
And stuttered as she sighed
I wish to sing the chicken song
Ching-a-ling song is fine
Id give my jewels and caviar
To make this daydream mine
Ching-a-ling ching-a-ling ching-a-ling ching-a-ling
Ching-a-ling ching-a-ling ching-a-ling ching-a-ling
Ching-a-ling ching-a-ling ching-a-ling
Doo dah doo doo dah dah doo dah dah dah dah dah dah dah
While stepping through a heavens eye
Two lover souls we spied
They wished the cloud boys sang to me
A cheerful happy cry
We love to play our love-strong hearts
No better do we know
No gifts of money do we give
For love is all we own
Na na na na na na na na na na na na na na
Ching-a-ling ching-a-ling ching-a-ling ching-a-ling
Ching-a-ling ching-a-ling ching-a-ling ching-a-ling

Ching-a-ling ching-a-ling ching-a-ling ching-a-ling
Ching-a-ling ching-a-ling ching-a-ling ching-a-ling
Ching-a-ling ching-a-ling ching-a-lingThe children of the summers end
Gathered in the dampened grass
We played Our songs and felt the London sky
Resting on our hands
It was Gods land
It was ragged and naive
It was Heaven
Touch we touched the very soul
Of holding each and every life
We claimed the very source of joy ran through
It didnt but it seemed that way
I kissed a lot of people that day
Oh to capture just one drop of all the ecstasy that swept that afternoon
To paint that love upon a white balloon
And fly it from the toppest top of all the tops that man has pushed beyond his
Brain
Satoria must be something just the same
We scanned the skies with rainbow eyes and saw machines of every shape and size
We talked with tall Venusians passing through
And Peter tried to climb aboard but the Captain shook his head
And away they soared
Climbing through the ivory vibrant cloud
Someone passed some bliss among the crowd
And we walked back to the road unchainedI dont know why but Im tired of my mind
Pain is over me overloading
I dont know why but youre trying to be kind
Take off your silver smile throw your head back
And cry
I dont believe but Im trying to decide
Which game is best for me which can I bare
You dont perseve so Im leading you away
Home were youve never been non-returning
So cry
Throw a rock upon the road and it breaks into pieces
Shake brach upon the snow and the sun is defeated
Pull the curtains on yesterday and it seems so much later
Put a bullet in my brain and Ill make all the papers
I dont know why but Im tired of my life
The clouds are in my eyes overtakingWhat are you doing to yourself
What are you doing to yourself
What are you doing to yourself
Its the last thing you should do
Nobody laughs anymore
Nobody laughs anymore
Nobody laughs anymore
Its the worst thing you can do
Save the last dance for me
Catch the last bus with me
Give the last kiss to me
Its the safest thing to doCome they told me
Pa-rum-pum-pum-pum
A new born king to see
Pa-rum-pum-pum-pum
Our finest gifts we bring
Pa-rum-pum-pum-pum
Rum-pum-pum-pum
Rum-pum-pum-pum
Peace on earth can it be
Years from now perhaps well see
See the day of glory
See the day when men of good will
Live in peace live in peace again
Peace on earth can it be
Every child must be made aware
Every child must be made to care
Care enough for his fellow man
To give all the love that he can
I pray my wish will come true
For my child and your child too
Hell see the day of glory
See the day when men of good will
Live in peace live in peace again
Peace on earth can it be
Can it beI I will be king
And you you will be queen
Though nothing will drive them away
We can beat them just for one day
We can be heroes just for one day
And you you can be mean
And i Ill drink all the time
cause were lovers and that is a fact
Yes were lovers and that is that
Though nothing will keep us together
We could steal time just for one day
We can be heroes for ever and ever

O wir koennen sie schlagen
Fuer alle zeiten
Dann sind wir helden
Nur diesen tag
Dann sind wir helden
Dann sind wir helden
Dann sind wir helden
Nur diesen tag
Dann sind wir helden

She played a good game of darts and the men slapped her back
And never took her out
She wore a trenchcoat khaki
Her hobnail boots were full of holes
Shes got medals
Her mother called her Mary but she changed her name to Tommy shes a one oh
She went and joined the army passed the medical
Dont ask me how its done
They sent her to the front line
Fighting for her countrys name
Shes got medals
She got very tired of picking up girls
Cleaning her gun and shaving her curls
Then the enemy dropped a bomb
Survivors there were none
People say that when the moon is full and all the stars have gone to bed
You can see her ghost but thats a lie because the naughty woman isnt dead
She deserted on the previous morning
Replaced her uniform with dresses silk and green
Called herself Eileen
Came to London town
Now shes settled down
Shes got medalsOh show me the way to the next whiskey bar

Un pensiero uno solo
Io cammino mentre dorme la cittÃ 
I soui occhi nella notte
Fanali bianchi nella notte
Una voce che mi parla chi sarÃ 
Dimmi ragazzo solo dove vai
PerchÃ tanto dolore
Hai perduto senza dubbio un grande amore
Ma di amori Ã tutta piena la cittÃ 
No ragazza sola no no no
Stavolta sei in errore
Non ho perso solamente un grande amore
Ieri sera ho perso tutto con lei
Con lei
I colori della vita
Lei
Cieli blu
Una come lei non la troverÃ² mai piÃ¹
Ora ragazzo solo dove andrai
La notte Ã un grande mare
Se ti serve la mia mano per nuotare
Grazie ma stasera io vorrei morire
PerchÃ sai negli occhi miei
CÃ un angelo un angelo
Che ormai non vola piÃ¹ che ormai non vola piÃ¹
Che ormai non vola piÃ¹
CÃ lei
I colori della vita
Lei
Cieli blu
Una come lei non la troverÃ² mai piÃ¹Wish I were a sailor crossing an azure sea
Under leaden skies under your eyes
But I cant see too far with these animal eyes
Cant hold my breath without your voice
An Im danger-prone Ill be bound
Ill be fast as hell without your touch
An Ill run run run run run
An Ill run run run run run without your love
Im a Goldman Im a soaring tower
And its cold in here without your love

The hand that wrote this letter
Sweeps the pillow clean
So rest your head and read a treasured dream
I care for no one else but you
I tear my soul to cease the pain
I think maybe you feel the same
What can we do
Im not quite sure what were supposed to do
So Ive been writing just for you
They say your life is going very well
They say you sparkle like a different girl
But something tells me that you hide
When all the world is warm and tired
You cry a little in the dark
Well so do i
Im not quite sure what youre supposed to say
But I can see its not okay
He makes you laugh
He brings you out in style
He treats you well
And makes you up real fine
And when hes strong
Hes strong for you
And when you kiss
Its something new
But did you ever call my name
Just by mistake
Im not quite sure what Im supposed to do
So Ill just write some love to you
Du du duuu du-du-du do-do-do do do doaoaoaaaaInstrumentalBaby you can own two hearts
Baby dont try to tear me apart
Someones got to go and I wont I wont
Thats a promise
Baby you cant fool around
Baby cant turn me upside down
Someones got to go and I wont I wont
Thats a promise
Its just a matter of time before you call him on the phone
Tell him please please leave him alone
Please leave him alone
Its just a matter of time call him on the phone
Tell him please please leave him alone
Please leave him alone
Baby youve got me used
Baby Cant you be like you
Someones got to go and I wont I wont
Thats a promise
Ad lib to endLucy I know what youre going to going to do
Oh Lucy look what youre doing Im doing it too
Now youre looking for God in exciting new ways
I say trust Him at once which is something these days
Lucy cant dance to the noise but she knows what the noise can do
Lucy cant dance to the noise but she knows what the noise can do
Did the world just explode
Dont recognize anyone
But youve still got me under your thumb
Lucy cant dance to the noise but she knows what the noise can do
Pursuing your frenzy in Ritz or Savoy
In this sexual noise vicious chords offer joy
You live and you die in the blink of an eye
Well I cant make you dance
Dance to the noise
Lucy cant dance but she knows what the noise can do
Dance to the noise
Lucy cant dance but she knows what the noise can do
Lucy I know what youre going to going to do
But you cant buy me off in this serial world
Who who who died and made you material girl
Lucy cant dance to the noise but she knows what the noise can do
So Ill spin while my lunatic lyric goes wrong
Guess Ill put all my eggs in a postmodern song
Lucy cant dance to the noise but she knows what the noise can do
Or this shallow orb mugged by reality
Just a few simple words like I love you I need you
Live and you die in the blink of an eye
Still I cant make you dance
Dance to the noise
Lucy cant dance but she knows what the noise can doInstrumentalBaby loves that way

I demand a better future

For I might just stop loving you
Loving you loving you

For I might just stop loving you loving you loving you

Ricochet
Ricochet
The world is on a corner waiting for jobs
Ricochet
Ricochet
Turn the holy pictures so they face the wall
And who can bear to be forgotten
March of flowers march of dimes
These are the prisons these are the crimes
Men wait for news while thousands are still asleep
Dreaming of tramlines factories pieces of machinery
Mine shafts things like that
March of flowers march of dimes
These are the prisons these are the crimes
Sound of thunder sound of gold
Sound of the devil breaking parole
Ricochet its not the end of the world
Sound of thunder sound of gold
Sound of the devil breaking parole
Ricochet ricochet
These are the prisons these are the crimes
Teaching life in a violent new way
Ricochet ricochet
Turn the holy pictures so they face the wall
And who can bear to be forgotten
And who can bear to be forgotten
March of flowers march of dimes
These are the prisons these are the crimes
Early before the sun they struggle off to the gates
In their secret fearful places they see their lives
Unraveling before them
March of flowers march of dimes
These are the prisons these are the crimes
Sound of thunder sound of gold
Sound of the devil breaking parole
Ricochet its not the end of the world
But when they get home damp eyed and weary
They smile and crush their children to their heaving chests
Making unfulfillable promises
For who can bear to be forgottenColumbine my frail design
I see you see me standing on my own
Is it you that Im walking through
Should I retrace my point of view
Im left in clouded dreams of finding who
Not columbine
Just incase youre my disguise
I found yourself to my surprise
Im on the ground
And its harlequin who fix me up
Who catches you
Who wanishes me
From finding who

Of the rose on your cheek the wounded and dumb
We stumble and fall we stumble and fall
Skin on skin but theres heaven in
Heavens in here
Heavens in here
Among the twilight and stars
Like a rocket to Mars
Heaven in here
The first and the last are telling it all
Telling you loud but selling it small
Im taking a swing at this shadow of mine
Crucifix hangs and my hearts in my mouth but its here
Heavens in here
Heavens in here
Among the twilight and stars
Like a rocket to Mars
Heaven in here
Heaven in one sigh heaven in two eyes
Heaven lies between your marbled thighs
The rustle of your falling gown
We stumble and fall like tragedy falls
We stumble and twirl theres heaven in here
We stumble and fall uncertain we fall
Flesh on flesh but theres heaven in
Heavens in here
Heavens in here
Heavens in here
Among the twilight and stars
Like a rocket to Mars
Heaven in here
Youll dance to my tongue
Well dance on the sun
Were the twilight and stars
Theres heaven in hereTheres no hold
The moving has come through
The danger passing you
Turns its face into the heat and runs the tunnels
Its so cold
The dark dug up by dogs
The stiches torn and broke
The raw meat fist you choke
Has hit the bloodlite
Glass traps open and close on
Night flights
Broken necks feather weights press the walls
Be my love we will be gods on night flights
With only one promise only one way to fall
Glass traps open and close on night flights
Broken necks feather weights press the walls
Be my love we will be gods on night flights
With only one promise only one way to call
On night flights
Only one way to fallListen baby let me lie low lie low with you
To be lie-high-high-high
High-high lie-low lie
Slowly its good and holy
Helping one another just a righteous brother
Lifetime give me back my lifetime
I dont want to be an angel just a little bit evil
Feel the devil in me
Holy holy
Hold on to anyone hold on to anyone
But just let me be
Holy holy
Hold on to anyone hold on to anyone

We are praying
Athena Athena
Athena AthenaFingertip sun at sideshow stalls they throw the balls
At coconut fur that hides behind coloured shades that blind your eyes
Every childs mother holds an ice-cream cone they circle round
Perceived unknown by an eye that peers from a hole in the tent where no one goes
A figure sitting cross-legged on the floor hes clogged and clothed in saffron robes
His beads are all he owns
Slow down slow down
Someone must have said that slow him down
Slow down slow down
Its pictured on the arms of the karma man
Fairy tale skin depicting scenes from human zoos
Impermanent toys like peace and war a gentle face youve seen before
Karma man tattooed on your side the wheel of life
I see my times and who Ive been I only live now and I dont know why
I struggle hard to take these pictures in but
All my friends can see is just the pinkness of his skin
Slow down slow down
Someone must have said that slowed him down
Slow down slow down
Its pictured on the arms of the karma manJust when Im ready to throw in my hand
Just when the best things in life are gone
I look into your eyes uh uh
Theres no smoke without fire uh uh
Youre exactly who I want to be with uh uh
Without you
What would I do
And when Im willing to call it a day
Just when I wont take another chance
I hold your hand uh uh
Theres no smoke without fire uh uh
Woman I love you uh uh
Without you
What would I doNow Not tomorrow
Yesterday

It happens today
The damage today
They fall on today
They beat on the outside
And Ill stand by you
Now Not tomorrow
Its happening now

The crazed in the hot-zone
The mental and divas hands
The fisting of life
To the music outside

A winters day a bitter snowflake on my face
My summer girl takes little backward steps away
Jack Frost took her hand and left me Jack Frost aint so cool
Sell me a coat with buttons of silver
Sell me a coat thats red or gold
Sell me a coat with little patch pockets
Sell me a coat cause I feel cold
And when she smiles the ice forgets to melt away
Not like before her smile was warming yesterday
See the trees like silver candy feel my icy hand
Sell me a coat with buttons of silver
Sell me a coat thats red or gold
Sell me a coat with little patch pockets
Sell me a coat cause I feel cold
See my eyes my window pane
See my tears like gentle rain
Thats the memory of a summer day
Sell me a coat with buttons of silver
Sell me a coat thats red or gold
Sell me a coat with little patch pockets
Sell me a coat cause I feel cold
Sell me a coat with buttons of silver
Sell me a coat thats red or gold
Sell me a coat with little patch pockets
Sell me a coat cause I feel cold
La la la la la laIm lazy
Youre crazy girl
Stay by my side
Im scared youll
Meet someone
In whom youll confide
Chorus
Lifes still a dream
Your loves amazing
Since I found you
My lifes amazing
I pledge you
Youll never be blue
Theres too much at stake to be down
My nightmare
Rooted here watching you go
Divine in both our lives
Chorus
My lifes a roll
Go go go
And its amazingDay after day
They send my friends away
To mansions cold and grey
To the far side of town
Where the thin men stalk the streets
While the sane stay underground
Day after day
They tell me I can go
They tell me I can blow
To the far side of town
Where its pointless to be high
Cause its such a long way down
So I tell them that
I can fly I will scream I will break my arm
I will do me harm
Here I stand foot in hand talking to my wall
Im not quite right at all am I
Dont set me free Im as heavy as can be
Just my librium and me
And my EST makes three
Cause Id rather stay here
With all the madmen
Than perish with the sad men roaming free
And Id rather play here
With all the madmen
For Im quite content theyre all as sane
As me
Where can the horizon lie
When a nation hides
Its organic minds
In a cellar dark and grim
They must be very dim
Day after day
They take some brain away
Then turn my face around
To the far side of town
And tell me that its real
Then ask me how I feel
Here I stand foot in hand talking to my wall
Im not quite right at all
Dont set me free Im as helpless as can be
My libidos split on me
Gimme some good ole lobotomy
Cause Id rather stay here
With all the madmen
Than perish with the sad men
Roaming free
And Id rather play here
With all the madmen
For Im quite content
Theyre all as sane as me

Theres no room for anger were all very small oh by jingo
Were painting our faces and dressing in thoughts from the skies from paradise
But they think that were holding a secretive ball
Wont someone invite them
Theyre just taller children ooh thats all after all
Man is an obstacle sad as the clown oh by jingo
So hold on to nothing and he wont let you down oh by jingo
Some people are marching together and some on their own
Quite alone
Others are running the smaller ones crawl
But some sit in silence theyre just older children
Thats all after all
I sing with impertinence shading impermanent chords
With my words
Ive borrowed your time and Im sorry I called
But the thought just occurred that were nobodys children at all after all
Live your rebirth and do what you will oh by jingo
Forget all Ive said please bear me no ill oh by jingo
After all after allI count the corpses on my left I find Im not so tidy
So I better get away better make it today
Ive cut twenty-three down since Friday
But I cant control it my face is drawn
My instinct still emotes it
I slash them cold I kill them dead
I broke the gooks I cracked their heads
Ill bomb them out from under the beds
But now Ive got the running gun blues
It seems the peacefuls stopped the war
Left generals squashed and stifled
But Ill slip out again tonight
Cause they havent taken back my rifle
For I promote oblivion
And Ill plug a few civilians
Ill slash them cold Ill kill them dead
Ill break them gooks Ill crack their heads
Ill slice them till theyre running red
But now Ive got the running gun blues
Ill slash them cold Ill kill them dead
Ill break them gooks Ill crack their heads
Ill slice them till theyre running red
But now Ive got the running gun blues
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh oohPresident Joe once had a dream
The world held his hand gave their pledge
So he told them his scheme for a savior machine
They called it the Prayer its answer was law
Its logic stopped war gave them food
How they adored till it cried in its boredom
Please dont believe in me please disagree with me
Life is too easy a plague seems quite feasible now
Or maybe a war or I may kill you all
Dont let me stay dont let me stay
My logic says burn so send me away
Your minds are too green I despise all Ive seen
You cant stake your lives on a savior machine
I need you flying and Ill show that dying
Is living beyond reason sacred dimension of time
I perceive every sign I can steal every mind
Dont let me stay dont let me stay
My logic says burn so send me away
Your minds are too green I despise all Ive seen
You cant stake your lives on a savior machineWe met upon a hill the night was cool and still
She sucked my dormant will
Mother she blew my brain I will go back again
My god she shook me cold
I had no time to spare I grabbed her golden hair
And threw her to the ground
Father she craved my head oh lord the things she said
My god she should be told
I was very smart
Broke the gentle hearts of many young virgins
I was quick on the ball left them so lonely
Theyd just give up trying
Then she took my head smashed it up
Kept my young blood rising
Crushed me mercilessly kept me going around
So she dont know I crave her so-o-o
Ill give my love in vain to reach that peak again
We met upon a hill
Mother she blew my brain I will go back again
My god she shook me coldWhen all the world was very young
And mountain magic heavy hung
The supermen would walk in file
Guardians of a loveless isle
And gloomy browed with super fear their tragic endless lives
Heaves nor sighs in solemn perverse serenity
wondrous beings chained to life
Strange games they would play then
No death for the perfect men
Life rolls into one for them
So softly a super god cries
Where all were minds in uni-thought
Power is weird by mystics taught
No pain no joy no power too great
Colossal strength to grasp a fate
Where sad-eyed mermen tossed in slumbers
Nightmare dreams no mortal mind could hold
A man would tear his brothers flesh a chance to die
To turn to mold
Far out in the red-sky
Far out from the sad eyes
Strange mad celebration
So softly a super god criesIn the corner of the morning in the past
I would sit and blame the master first and last
All the roads were straight and narrow
And the prayers were small and yellow
And the rumour spread that I was aging fast
Then I ran across a monster who was sleeping
By a tree
And I looked and frowned and the monster was me
Well I said hello and I said hello
And I asked why not and I replied I dont know
So we asked a simple black bird who was happy as can be
And he laughed insane and quipped Kahlil Gibran
And I cried for all the others till the day was nearly through
For I realized that Gods a young man too
Ho
Oh I said so long and I waved bye-bye
And I smashed my soul and traded my mind
Got laid by a young bordello
Who was vaguely half asleep
For which my reputation swept back home in drag
And the moral of this magic spell
Negotiates my hide
When God did take my logic for a ride
Riding along
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
He swallowed his pride and puckered his lips
And showed me the leather belt round his hips
My knees were shaking my cheeks aflame
He said youll never go down to the Gods again
Turn around go back
He struck the ground a cavern appeared
And I smelt the burning pit of fear
We crashed a thousand yards below
I said do it again do it again
Turn around go back
His nebulous body swayed above
His tongue swollen with devils love
The snake and I a venom high
I said do it again do it again
Turn around go back
Breathe breathe breathe deeply
And I was seething breathing deeply
Spitting sentry horned and tailed
Waiting for you oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh ohWe passed upon the stair
We spoke of was and when
Although I wasnt there
He said I was his friend
Which came as some surprise
I spoke into his eyes
I thought you died alone
A long long time ago
Oh no not me
I never lost control
Youre face to face
With the man who sold the world
I laughed and shook his hand
And made my way back home
I searched for form and land
For years and years I roamed
I gazed a gazley stare
At all the millions here
We must have died alone
A long long time ago
Who knows
Not me
We never lost control
Youre face to face
With the man who sold the worldDont look down
Theyre making sorta crazy sounds
Dont look down no
Dont know who else came to kneel
On this empty battlefield
But when I hear that crazy sound I dont look down
From Central Park to shanty town
I always hear that crazy sound
From New York to shanty town
Theres always something else
Dont look down no
I went this morning to the cemetery
To see old Rudy Valentino buried
Lipstick traces on his name
He never looked down
Cause they were making crazy sounds sound
From Central park to shanty town
He always heard that crazy sound
Theres always something else
Dont look down dont look down no
When I see you standing there
I cant see the clothes you wear
I just hear that crazy sound
And I cant look down
From Central Park to shanty town
Ive always heard that crazy sound
From New York to shanty town
Theres always something else
Dont look down no

No I wont be bored I wont be there
Look at life its no piece of cake
When I hear that crazy sound

From New York to shanty town
Theres always something else
Dont look down dont look down dont look down
Dont look down no
Well dont look dont look down

My life would still go on believe me
The world could show nothing to me
So what good would living do me
God only knows what Id be without you
I may not always love you
But as long as there are stars above you
Youll never need to doubt it
Ill make you so sure about it
God only knows what Id be without you

If you should ever leave me
My life would still go on believe me
The world could show nothing to me

Somebodys living there and
He dont really feel the weather
And he dont share your pleasures

Look at his eyes
Did you see his crazy eyes
Youre so surprised he dont run to catch your ash
Everybody always wants to kiss your trash
Ah you cant help him
Nobody can
Now that he knows
Theres nothing to get
Will you still place your bet
On the neighborhood threat
Somewhere a babys bleeding
Somewhere a mothers needing
Outside a boy is lying
But mostly he is crying
And he just shouts in anger
Youll find him interesting

Youre so surprised he doesnt build for you
Everybody always wants to run with you
Ah you cant help him

Dont place your bets when the neighbor comes
On the neighborhood threat neighborhood threat

On the neighborhood threatI keep forgetting you dont love me no more
I keep forgetting you dont love me no more
I keep forgetting that you told me that you
Didnt want me around any more
But these stupid old feet
Just head for your street
Like theyve done so many times before
And this stubborn old fist
On the end of my wrist
Keeps a knocking on your front door
I keep forgetting you dont love me no more
I keep forgetting you dont love me no more
I keep forgetting bout those heartbreaking nights
And those heartbreaking things
That you said
Though I know in my heart
Were drifting apart
I cant believe that our love is dead
Though its plain as can be
That youre finished with me
I just cant get it through my head
I keep forgetting you dont love me no more
I keep forgetting you dont want me no more
I keep forgetting you dont want me no more
Though I know in my heart
Were drifting apart
I cant believe that our love is dead
Though its plain as can be
That youre finished with me
I just cant get it through my headIve seen the city
I took the next flight
For Borneo
They say its pretty
I like the tee shirts
In Borneo
Some wear Bob Marley
Others in playboy
Or Duvalier
Make the last plane come
Let me rise through the cloudy above
With a book on Borneo
Strangers come and go
Its such a waste of time
Problems far behind
Another day
But even in springtime
Its a rich slice of life
So send me a letter
Ill reply with a broken spear
That dusky mulatto
In nylons and tattoos
Hot juice in coke bottles
We dance in the sand
Well they twirl and they tumble
Yes they twirl and they tumble
Well Ill twirl and Ill tumble
Ive been to Leons
Hes got nine daughters
And a stereo
They say that Leon
Watches from the tree tops
In Borneo
When the road is mud
Everything stops with a thud
Thats the way it goes way down
Yonder in Borneo
Far beneath his mansion
Theres an open drain
Sending all the sewage down the hill
But when the general shows movies
No one hesitates
To sneak from the jungle
They laugh and they mumble
Enjoying the show
And that dusky mulatto
Hot juice in coke bottles
In blue jeans and tattoos
Well they twirl and they tumble
Yes they twirl and they tumble
Well Ill twirl and Ill tumble
I like the free world
They say its pretty
This time of year
They tumble and twirl
They tumble and twirl
Ill tumble and twirl
They twirl and they tumble
I like the free world
I like the free world
They say its pretty
This time of year
This time of yearSomethings going on in society

You chew your fingers and stare at the floor
Dancing with the big boys

Talking bout a hands on policy
Big boys
Death to the trees
Dancing with the big boys
They werent bad they werent brave
Nothing is embarrassing
Dancing with the big boys
There are too many people too much belief
Dancing with the big boys

Dancing with the big boys
Loneliness in a free society
Dancing with the big boys

Big boys
Dancing with the big boys
Dancing with the big boysWatching them come and go
The Templars and the Saracens
Theyre traveling the holy land
Opening telegrams
Torture comes and torture goes
Knights whod give you anything
They bear the cross of Coeur de Leon
Salvation for the mirror blind
But if you pray all your sins are hooked upon the sky
Pray and the heathen lie will disappear
Prayers they hide the saddest view
Believing the strangest things loving the alien
And your prayers they break the sky in two
Believing the strangest things loving the alien
You pray til the break of dawn
Believing the strangest things loving the alien
And youll believe youre loving the alien
Believing the strangest things loving the alien
Thinking of a different time
Palestine a modern problem
Bounty and your wealth in land
Terror in a best laid plan
Watching them come and go
Tomorrows and the yesterdays
Christians and the unbelievers
Hanging by the cross and nailEverything will be alright tonight
Everything will be alright tonight
No one moves
No one talks
No one thinks
No one walks tonight
Everyone will be alright tonight
Everyone will be alright tonight
No one moves
No one talks
No one thinks
No one walks tonight
Tonight
I am gonna love you till the end
I will love you till I reach the end
I will love her till I die
I will see you in the sky
Tonight
Tonight
Everything will be alright tonight
Everything will be alright tonight
No one moves
No one talks
No one thinks
No one walks tonight
Tonight
Tonight
Tonight
TonightI staggered through this criminal reign
Im not in love no phony pain
Creeping through this tidal wave
No warm embrace just a lovers grain
This symphony
This rage in me
Ive got a handful of songs to sing
To sting your soul
To fuck you over
This furious reign
Im falling man
Im choking man
Im fading man
And broke and blind
Im falling man
Im choking man
Im fading man
Just killing a little time
I love the sound of an empty room
The screams of night the end of love
Two beating hearts one labored scarred
One open wound wasted and drowned
No sympathy
This furious reign
I lay in bed
The monster fed the body bled
I turned and said
I get some of you all the time
All of you some other time
This rage in me
Get away from me
Im falling man
Im choking man
Im fading man
And broke and blind
Im falling man
Im choking man
Im fading man
Just killing a little timeIts safe in the city to love in a doorway
To wrangle some screams from the dawn
And isnt it me putting pain in a stranger
Like a portrait in flesh who trails on a leash
Will you see that Im scared and Im lonely
So Ill break up my room and yawn and I
Run to the center of things
Where the knowing one says
Boys Boys its a sweet thing
Boys Boys its a sweet thing sweet thing
If you want it Boys get it here thing
Cause hope Boys is a cheap thing cheap thing
Im glad that youre older than me
Makes me feel important and free
Does that make you smile isnt that me
Im in your way and Ill steal every moment
If this trade is a curse then Ill bless you
And turn to the crossroads of Hamburg as in
Boys Boys its a sweet thing
Boys Boys its a sweet thing sweet thing
If you want it Boys get it here thing
Cause hope Boys is a cheap thing cheap thing
Part Two Candidate
Ill make you a deal like any other candidate
Well pretend were walking home cause your futures at stake
My set is amazing it even smells like a street
Theres a bar at the end where I can meet you and your friend
Someone scrawled on the wall I smell the blood of Les Tricoteuses
Who wrote up scandals in other bars
Im having so much fun with the poisonous people
Spreading rumors and lies and stories they made up
Some make you sing and some make you scream
One makes you wish that youd never been seen
But theres a shop on the corner thats selling papier mache
Making bullet-proof faces Charlie Manson Cassius Clay
If you want it Boys get it here thing
So you scream out of line
I want you I need you Anyone out there Any time
Tres butch little number whines Hey dirty I want you
When its good its really good and when its bad I go to pieces
If you want it Boys get it here thing
Well on the street where you live I could not hold up my head
For I put all I have in another bed
On another floor in the back of a car
In the cellar of a church with the door ajar
Well I guess we must be looking for a different kind
But we cant stop trying til we break up our minds
Til the sun drips blood on the seedy young knights
Who press you on the ground while shaking in fright
I guess we could cruise down one more time
With you by my side it should be fine
Well buy some drugs and watch a band
Then jump in the river holding hands
Part Three Sweet Thing Reprise
If you want it boys get it here thing
Cause hope boys is a cheap thing cheap thing
Is it nice in your snow storm freezing your brain
Do you think that your face looks the same
Then let it be its all I ever wanted
Its a street with a deal and a taste
Its got claws its got me its got you N obokov is sun-licked now
Upon the beach at Gruenwald
Brilliant and naked just
The way that authors looks
Clare and Lady Manners drink
Until the other cows go home
Gossip till their lips are bleeding
Politics and all
Id rather be high Id rather be high
Id rather be flying Id rather be flying
Id rather be dead or out of my head
Than training these guns on those men in the sand
Id rather be high
The Thames was black the tower dark
I flew to Cairo find my regiment
Citys full of generals
And generals full of shit
I stumble to the graveyard and I
Lay down by my parents whisper
Just remember duckies
Everybody gets got

You pull on your finger then another finger then your cigarette
The wall to wall is calling it lingers then you forget
Ohhh youre a rock n roll suicide
Youre too old to lose it too young to choose it
And the clock waits so patiently on your song
You walk past a cafe but you dont eat when youve lived too long
Oh no no no youre a rock n roll suicide
Chev brakes are snarling as you stumble across the road
But the day breaks instead so you hurry home
Dont let the sun blast your shadow
Dont let the milk float ride your mind
Youre so natural religiously unkind
Oh no love Youre not alone
Youre watching yourself but youre too unfair
You got your head all tangled up
But if I could only make you care
Oh no love Youre not alone
No matter what or who youve been
No matter when or where youve seen
All the knives seem to lacerate your brain
Ive had my share Ill help you with the pain
Youre not alone
Just turn on with me and youre not alone
Lets turn on with me and youre not alone
Gimme your hands cause youre wonderful
Gimme your hands cause youre wonderful
Oh gimme your handsIts the darkest hour youre twenty-two
The voice of youth the hour of dread
Its the darkest hour and your voice is new
Love is lost and lost is love
Your countrys new your friends are new
Your house and even your eyes are new
Your maid is new and your accent too
But your fear is as old as the world
Say goodbye to the thrills of life
When love was good when love was bad
Wave goodbye to the life without pain
Say hello your beautiful girl
Say hello to the greater men
Tell them your secrets theyre like the grave
Oh what have you done oh what have you done
Love is lost lost is love
You know so much its making you cry
You refuse to talk but you think like mad
Youve cut out your zone and the things have fold
Oh what have you done oh what have you done
Oh what have you done oh what have you doneWhen Im five
I will wash my face me hands all by myself
When Im five
I will chew and spit tabacco like my grandfather jones
cause Im only four and five is far away
When Im five
I will read the magazines in mummys drawer
When Im five
I will walk behind the soldiers in the may day parade
cause Im only four and grown-ups walk too fast
Yesterday was horrid day cause raymond kicked my shin
And mummy says if I am good shell let me go to school in August
Daddy shouted loud at mummy and I dropped my toast at breakfast
And I laughed when bonzo licked my face because it tickled
I wonder why my daddy cries and how I wish that I was nearly five
When Im five
I will catch a butterfly and eat it and I wont be sick
When Im five
I will jump in puddles laugh in church and marry my mum
And Ill let my daddy do the washing-up
If I close one eye the people on that side cant see me
I get headaches in the morning and I rode on freddies tricycle
And everywhere was funny when I ran down to the sweetshop
Then I fell and bleeded-up my knee and everybody soppied me
I saw a photograph of jesus and I asked him if hed make me five
I saw a photograph of jesus and I asked him if hed make me five
When Im five
When Im five
When Im oahLittle fat man who sold his soul
Little fat man who sold his dream
Pathetic little fat man
No ones bloody laughing
The clown that no one laughs at
They all just wish hed die
Hes so depressed at being hated
Fatso takes his own life
He blows his stupid brains out
But the twat would probably miss
He sold his soul for a shot at fame
Catchphrase and wigs and the jokes are lame
Hes got no style hes got no grace
Hes banal and facile hes a fat waste of spaceAnd so the story goes they wore the clothes
They said the things to make it seem improbable
Whale of a lie like they hope it was
And the good men tomorrow had their feet in the wallow
And their heads of brawn were nicer shorn
And how they bought their positions with saccharin and trust
And the world was asleep to our latent fuss
Sighings swirl through the streets like the crust of the sun the Bewlay Brothers
In our wings that bark
Flashing teeth of brass
Standing tall in the dark
Oh and we were gone
Hanging out with your dwarf men
We were so turned on
By your lack of conclusions
I was stone and he was wax so he could scream and still relax
Unbelievable
And we frightened the small children away
And our talk was old and dust would flow
Through our veins and though it was midnight back at the kitchen door
Like the grim face on the cathedral floor
The solid book we wrote cannot be found today
And it was stalking time for the moon boys the Bewlay Brothers
With our backs on the arch
And if the Devil may be here
But he cant sing about that
Oh and we were gone
Real cool traders
We were so turned on
You thought we were fakers
And now the dress is hung the ticket pawned
The factor max that proved the fact is melted down
Woven on the edging of my pillow
And my brother lays upon the rocks
He could be dead he could be not he could be you
Hes chameleon comedian Corinthian and caricature
Shooting up pie in the sky
Bewlay brothers
In the feeble in the bad
Bewlay brothers
In the blessed and cold
In the crutch-hungry dark
Was where we flayed our mark
Oh and we were gone
Kings of Oblivion
We were so turned on
In the night walk pavilion
Lay me place and bake me pie Im starving for me gravy
Leave my shoes and door unlocked I might just slip away
Just for the day ay
Please come away ay
Just for the day ay
Please come away ay
Please come away ay
Just for the day ay
Please come away ay
Please come away ay
Please come away ay
Please come away ay
Away
AwayOh hear this Robert Zimmerman
I wrote a song for you
About a strange young man called Dylan
With a voice like sand and glue
Some words had truthful vengeance
That could pin us to the floor
Brought a few more people on
And put the fear in a whole lot more
Ah here she comes
Here she comes here she comes again
The same old painted lady
From the brow of the superbrain
Shell scratch this world to pieces
As she comes on like a friend
Couple of songs from your old scrapbook
Could send her home again
Gave your heart to every bedsit room at least a
Picture on my wall
And you sat behind a million pair of eyes
And told them how they saw
Then we lost your train of thought
Your paintings are all your own
While troubles are rising wed rather be scared
Together than alone
Ah here she comes
Here she comes here she comes again
The same old painted lady
From the brow of the superbrain
Shell scratch this world to pieces
As she comes on like a friend
But a couple of songs from your old scrapbook
Could send her home again
Now hear this Robert Zimmerman
Though I dont suppose well meet
Ask your good friend Dylan
If hed gaze a while down the old street
Tell him weve lost his poems
So were writing on the walls
Give us back our unity
Give us back our family
Youre every nations refugee
Dont leave us with their sanity
Ah here she comes
Here she comes here she comes again
The same old painted lady
From the brow of the superbrain
Shell scratch this world to pieces
As she comes on like a friend
But a couple of songs from your old scrapbook
Could send her home again
Ah couple of songs from your old scrapbook
Could send her home again
Oh here she comes
Here she comes and here she comesIts a God-awful small affair
To the girl with the mousy hair
But her mummy is yelling no
And her daddy has told her to go
But her friend is nowhere to be seen
Now she walks through her sunken dream
To the seat with the clearest view
And shes hooked to the silver screen
But the film is a saddening bore
For shes lived it ten times or more
She could spit in the eyes of fools
As they ask her to focus on
Sailors fighting in the dance hall
Oh man look at those cavemen go
Its the freakiest show
Take a look at the lawman
Beating up the wrong guy
Oh man wonder if hell ever know
Hes in the best selling show
Is there life on Mars
Its on Americas tortured brow
That Mickey Mouse has grown up a cow
Now the workers have struck for fame
Cause Lennons on sale again
See the mice in their million hordes
From Ibiza to the Norfolk Broads
Rule Britannia is out of bounds
To my mother my dog and clowns
But the film is a saddening bore
Cause I wrote it ten times or more
Its about to be writ again
As I ask you to focus on
Sailors fighting in the dance hall
Oh man look at those cavemen go
Its the freakiest show
Take a look at the lawman
Beating up the wrong guy
Oh man wonder if hell ever know
Hes in the best selling show
Is there life on MarsOh yeah
Mmm
Still dont know what I was waitin for
And my time was runnin wild
A million dead end streets and
Every time I thought Id got it made
It seemed the taste was not so sweet
So I turned myself to face me
But Ive never caught a glimpse
How the others must see the faker
Im much too fast to take that test
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Dont want to be a richer man
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Theres gonna have to be a different man
Time may change me
But I cant trace time
Mmm yeah
I watch the ripples change their size
But never leave the stream
Of warm impermanence
And so the days float through my eyes
But still the days seem the same
And these children that you spit on
As they try to change their worlds
Are immune to your consultations
Theyre quite aware of what theyre goin through
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Dont tell them to grow up and out of it
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Wheres your shame
Youve left us up to our necks in it
Time may change me
But you cant trace time
Strange fascinations fascinate me
Ah changes are takin
The pace Im goin through
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Ooh look out you rock n rollers
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Pretty soon now youre gonna get older
Time may change me
But I cant trace time
I said that time may change me
But I cant trace timeLike to take a cement fix
Be a standing cinema
Dress my friends up just for show
See them as they really are
Put a peephole in my brain
Two New Pence to have a go
Id like to be a gallery
Put you all inside my show
Andy Warhol looks a scream
Hang him on my wall
Andy Warhol Silver Screen
Cant tell them apart at all
Andy walking Andy tired
Andy take a little snooze
Tie him up when hes fast asleep
Send him on a pleasant cruise
When he wake up on the sea
He sure to think of me and you
Hell think about paint and hell think about glue
What a jolly boring thing to do
Andy Warhol looks a scream
Hang him on my wall
Andy Warhol Silver Screen
Cant tell them apart at allThe tactful cactus by your window
Surveys the prairie of your room
The mobile spins to its collision
Clara puts her head between her paws
Theyve opened shops down the West side
Will all the cacti find a home
But the key to the city
Is in the sun that pins
The branches to the sky oh oh ohWill you stay in our lovers story
If you stay you wont be sorry
Cause we believe in you
Soon youll grow so take a chance
With a couple of Kooks
Hung up on romancing
Will you stay in our lovers story
If you stay you wont be sorry
Cause we believe in you
Soon youll grow so take a chance
With a couple of Kooks
Hung up on romancing
We bought a lot of things
To keep you warm and dry
And a funny old crib on which the paint wont dry
I bought you a pair of shoes
A trumpet you can blow
And a book of rules
On what to say to people
When they pick on you
Cause if you stay with us youre gonna be pretty Kookie too
Will you stay in our lovers story
If you stay you wont be sorry
Cause we believe in you
Soon youll grow so take a chance
With a couple of Kooks
Hung up on romancing
And if you ever have to go to school
Remember how they messed up
This old fool
Dont pick fights with the bullies or the cads
Cause Im not much cop at punching other peoples Dads
And if the homework brings you down
Then well throw it on the fire
And take the car downtown
Will you stay in our lovers story
If you stay you wont be sorry
Cause we believe in you
Soon youll grow so take a chance
With a couple of Kooks
Hung up on romancing
Will you stay in our lovers story
If you stay you wont be sorry
Cause we believe in you
Soon youll grow so take a chance
With a couple of Kooks
Hung up on romancingIm closer to the Golden Dawn
Immersed in Crowleys uniform
Of imagery
Im living in a silent film
Portraying Himmlers sacred realm
Of dream reality
Im frightened by the total goal
Drawing to the ragged hole
And I aint got the power anymore
No I aint got the power anymore
Im the twisted name on Garbos eyes
Living proof of Churchills lies Im destiny
Im torn between the light and dark
Where others see their targets divine symmetry
Should I kiss the vipers fang
Or herald loud the death of Man
Im sinking in the quicksand of my thought
And I aint got the power anymore
Dont believe in yourself dont deceive with belief
Knowledge comes with deaths release
Aah-aah aah-aah aah-aah aah-aah
Im not a prophet or a stone-age man
Just a mortal with the potential of a superman
Im living on
Im tethered to the logic of Homo Sapien
Cant take my eyes from the great salvation
Of bullshit faith
If I dont explain what you ought to know
You can tell me all about it on the next Bardo
Im sinking in the quicksand of my thought
And I aint got the power anymore
Dont believe in yourself dont deceive with belief
Knowledge comes with deaths release
Aah-aah aah-aah aah-aah aah-aah
Dont believe in yourself dont deceive with belief
Knowledge comes with deaths release
Aah-aah aah-aah aah-aah aah-aahWake up you sleepy head
Put on some clothes shake up your bed
Put another log on the fire for me
Ive made some breakfast and coffee
Look out my window and what do I see
A crack in the sky and a hand reaching down to me
All the nightmares came today
And it looks as though theyre here to stay
What are we coming to
No room for me no fun for you
I think about a world to come
Where the books were found by the Golden ones
Written in pain written in awe
By a puzzled man who questioned
What we were here for
All the strangers came today
And it looks as though theyre here to stay
Oh you Pretty Things
Dont you know youre driving your
Mamas and Papas insane
Oh you Pretty Things
Dont you know youre driving your
Mamas and Papas insane
Let me make it plain
You gotta make way for the Homo Superior
Look out at your children
See their faces in golden rays
Dont kid yourself they belong to you
Theyre the start of a coming race
The earth is a bitch
Weve finished our news
Homo Sapiens have outgrown their use
All the strangers came today
And it looks as though theyre here to stayOh yeah
Im up on the eleventh floor and Im watching the cruisers below
Hes down on the street and hes trying hard to pull sister Flo
Oh my hearts in the basement my weekends at an all-time low
Cause shes hoping to score so I cant see her letting him go
Walk out of her heart walk out of her mind oh not her
Shes so swishy in her satin and tat
In her frock coat and bipperty-bopperty hat
Oh God I could do better than that
Shes an old-time ambassador of sweet-talking night-walking games
And shes known in the darkest clubs for pushing ahead of the dames
If she says she can do it then she can do it she dont make false claims
But shes a queen and such are queens that your laughter is sucked in their brains
Now shes leading him on and shell lay him right down
Yes shes leading him on and shell lay him right down
But it could have been me yes it could have been me
Why didnt I say why didnt I say no no no
Shes so swishy in her satin and tat
In her frock coat and bipperty-bopperty hat
Oh God I could do better than that
So I lay down a while and I gaze at my hotel wall
Oh the cot is so cold it dont feel like no bed at all
Yeah I lay down a while and I look at my hotel wall
And hes down on the street so I throw both his bags down the hall
And Im phoning a cab cause my stomach feels small
Theres a taste in my mouth and its no taste at all
It could have been me oh yeah it could have been me
Why didnt I say why didnt I say no no no
Shes so swishy in her satin and tat
In her frock coat and bipperty-bopperty hat
Oh God I could do better than that
You betcha
Oh yeah
Uh-huhFill your heart with love today
Dont play the game of time
Things that happened in the past
Only happened in your mind only in your mind
Oh forget your mind and youll be free yeah
The writings on the wall
Free yeah and you can know it all
If you choose
Just remember lovers never lose
Cause they are free of thoughts unpure
And of thoughts unkind
Gentleness clears the soul
Love cleans the mind and makes it free
Oh happiness is happening
Dragons have been bled
Gentleness is everywhere
Fears just in your head only in your head
Fear is in your head only in your head
So forget your head and youll be free
The writings on the wall
Free yeah and you can know it all
If you choose
Just remember lovers never lose
Cause they are free of thoughts unpure
And of thoughts unkind
Gentleness clears the soul
Love will clean your mind and makes you free
Free yeah yeah-yeah-yeah yeah-yeah-yeah

Blue blue electric blue
Thats the color of my room where I will live
Mmm mmm mmm mmm
Blue blue
Pale blinds drawn all day
Nothing to do nothing to say
Mmm mmm mmm mmm
Blue blue
I will sit right down
Waiting for the gift of sound and vision
And I will sing and inaudible
Waiting for the gift of sound and vision
Drifting into my solitude over my head
Dont you wonder sometimes

Riding these shelly shelly shelly umm

I take it on the road
Those kilometers and the red lights
I was always looking left and right
Oh but Im
Always crashing in the same car
Jasmine I saw you peeping
As I pushed my foot down to the floor
I was going round and round
The hotel garage
Must have been touching close to ninety-four
Oh but Im
Always crashing in the same carInstrumentalInstrumentalMmmm-mm-mm-ommm

Though nothing nothing will keep us together
We can beat them forever and ever
Oh we can be heroes just for one day
I I will be King
And you you will be Queen
Though nothing will drive them away
We can be heroes just for one day
We can be us just for one day
I I can remember
I remember
Standing by the wall
By the wall
And the guns shot above our heads
Over our heads
And we kissed as though nothing could fall
Nothing could fall
And the shame was on the other side
Oh we can beat them forever and ever
Then we could be heroes just for one day
We can be heroes
We can be heroes
We can be heroes just for one day
We can be heroesSons of the silent age
Stand on platforms blank looks and notebooks
Sit in back rows of city limits
Lay in bed coming and going on easy terms
Sons of the silent age
Pace their rooms like a cells dimensions
Rise for a year or two then make war
Search through their one-inch thoughts
Then decide it couldnt be done
Baby Ill never let you go
All I see is all I know
Lets take another way down sons of sound and sons of sound
Baby baby Ill never let you down
I cant stand another sound
Lets fin another way in sons of sound and sons of sound
Sons of the silent age
Listen to tracks by Sam Therapy and King Dice
Sons of the silent age
Pick up in bars and cry only once
Sons of the silent age
Make love only once but dream and dream
Dont walk they just glide in and out of life
They never die they just go to sleep one day
Baby I wont ever let you go
All I see is all I know
Lets take another way down sons of sound and sons of sound
Oh baby baby baby I wont ever let you down
I cant stand another sound
Lets find another way in sons of sound and sons of sound
Sons of sound and sons of sound baby baby baby

Youve read it in the tea leaves and the tracks are on TV
Beware the savage jaw
Of one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four
Theyll split your pretty cranium and fill it full of air
And tell that youre eighty but brother you wont care
Youll be shooting up on anything tomorrows never there
Beware the savage jaw
Of one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four
Come see come see remember me
We played out an all night movie role
You said it would last but I guess we enrolled
In one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four who could ask for more
one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four Who could ask for mor-or-or-or-ore
Mor-or-or-or-ore
Im looking for a vehicle Im looking for a ride
Im looking for a party Im looking for a side
Im looking for the treason that I knew in sixty-five
Beware the savage jaw
Of one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four
Come see come see remember me

You pull on your finger then another finger then your cigarette
The wall to wall is calling it lingers then you forget
Ohhh youre a rock n roll suicide
Youre too old to lose it too young to choose it
And the clock waits so patiently on your song
You walk past a cafe but you dont eat when youve lived too long
Oh no no no youre a rock n roll suicide
Chev brakes are snarling as you stumble across the road
But the day breaks instead so you hurry home
Dont let the sun blast your shadow
Dont let the milk float ride your mind
Youre so natural religiously unkind
Oh no love Youre not alone
Youre watching yourself but youre too unfair
You got your head all tangled up
But if I could only make you care
Oh no love Youre not alone
No matter what or who youve been
No matter when or where youve seen
All the knives seem to lacerate your brain
Ive had my share Ill help you with the pain
Youre not alone
Just turn on with me and youre not alone
Lets turn on with me and youre not alone
Gimme your hands cause youre wonderful
Gimme your hands cause youre wonderful
Oh gimme your handsStone love she kneels before the grave
A brave son who gave his life
To save the slogans
That hovers between the headstone and her eyes
For they penetrate her grieving
New love a boy and girl are talking
New words that only they can share in
New words a love so strong it tears their hearts
To sleep through the fleeting hours of morning
Love is careless in its choosing
Sweeping over cross a baby
Love descends on those defenseless
Idiot love will spark the fusion
Inspirations have I none
Just to touch the flaming dove
All I have is my love of love
And love is not loving
Soul love the priest that tastes the word and
Told of love and how my God on high is
All love though reaching up my loneliness evolves
By the blindness that surrounds himTony went to fight in Belfast
Rudi stayed at home to starve
I could make it all worthwhile
As a rock and roll star
Bevan tried to change the nation
Sonny wants to turn the world well he can tell you that he tried
I could make a transformation as a rock and roll star
So inviting so enticing to play the part
I could play the wild mutation
As a rock and roll star get it on yeah
I could do with the money
Im so wiped out with things as they are
Id send my photograph to my honey and Id cmon like
A regular superstar
I could make a transformation
As a rock and roll star

So many mothers sighing
News had just come over
We had five years left to cry in
News guy wept and told us
Earth was really dying
Cried so much his face was wet
Then I knew he was not lying
I heard telephones opera house favorite melodies
I saw boys toys electric irons and TVs
My brain hurt like a warehouse it had no room to spare
I had to cram so many things to store everything in there
And all the fat-skinny people and all the tall-short people
And all the nobody people and all the somebody people
I never thought Id need so many people
A girl my age went off her head
Hit some tiny children
If the black hadnt a-pulled her off
I think she would have killed them
A soldier with a broken arm
Fixed his stare to the wheels of a Cadillac
A cop knelt and kissed the feet of a priest
And a queer threw up at the sight of that
I think I saw you in an ice-cream parlor
Drinking milk shakes cold and long
Smiling and waving and looking so fine
Dont think you knew you were in this song
And it was cold and it rained so I felt like an actor
And I thought of Ma and I wanted to get back there
Your face your race the way that you talk
I kiss you youre beautiful I want you to walk
Weve got five years stuck on my eyes
Five years what a surprise
Weve got five years my brain hurts a lot

Five yearsZiggy played guitar jamming good with Weird and Gilly
And the spiders from Mars He played it left hand
But made it too far
Became the special man then we were Ziggys band
Now Ziggy really sang screwed up eyes and screwed down hairdo
Like some cat from Japan he could lick em by smiling
He could leave em to hang
Came on so loaded man well hung and snow white tan
So where were the spiders while the fly tried to break our balls
With just the beer light to guide us
So we bitched about his fans and should we crush his sweet hands
Ziggy played for time jiving us that we were voodoo
The kid was just crass he was the nazz
With God given ass
He took it all too far but boy could he play guitar
Making love with his ego Ziggy sucked up into his mind
Like a leper messiah
When the kids had killed the man I had to break up the band
Ziggy played guitarPushing through the market square

Five yearsPeople stared at the makeup on his face
Laughed at his long black hair his animal grace
The boy in the bright blue jeans
Jumped up on the stage
Lady Stardust sang his songs
Of darkness and disgrace
And he was alright the band was altogether
Yes he was alright the song went on forever
Yes he was awful nice
Really quite out of sight
And he sang all night long
Femme fatales emerged from shadows
To watch this creature fair
Boys stood upon their chairs
To make their point of view
I smiled sadly for a love
I could not obey
Lady Stardust sang his songs
Of darkness and dismay
And he was alright the band was altogether
Yes he was alright his song went on forever
And he was awful nice
Really quite paradise
And he sang all night all night long
Oh how I sighed when they asked if I knew his name
Oh that was alright the band was altogether
Yes he was alright and the song went on forever

Look out over the sea
Think about the places perhaps where a young man could be
Then you jump back down to the rooftops
Look out over the town
Think about all of the strange things circulating round
It aint easy it aint easy
It aint easy to get to heaven when youre going down
Well all the people have got their problems
That aint nothing new
With the help of the good Lord
We can all pull on through

As a rock and roll star
I could fall in love all right
As a rock and roll star
Rock and roll star
Rock and roll star
Just watch me nowWay back in time
Someone said try some
I tried some
Now buy some I bought some
Oh oh oh
After a while
When I had tried them denied them
I opened my eyes and I saw you
Not a thing did I have
Not a thing did I see
Till I called on your love
And your love came to me
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh ohhh
Through my life
Ive seen grey sky met big fry
Seen them die to get high
Ohhh
And when it seemed that I would only be lonely
I opened my eyes and I saw you
Not a thing did I feel
Not a thing did I know
Till I called on your love
And your love sure did grow
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh ohhhWell some people try to pick up girls
This never happened to Pablo Picasso
He could walk down your street
And get called assholes
So Pablo Picasso was never called an asshole
And girls could not resist his stare and
Well the girls would turn the color
Of the avocado when he would drive
He could walk down your street
Down their street in his El Dorado
And girls could not resist his stare
Pablo Picasso never got called an asshole
Not like you
Alright
Well he was only fifty-three
But girls could not resist his stare
Not in New York
Pablo Picasso never got called an asshole
Oh well be not schmuck be not obnoxious
Remember the story of Pablo Picasso
Be not bellbottom bummer or asshole
He could walk down your street
Pablo Picasso was never called an asshole
Alright this is it
And girls could not resist his stare
Some people try to pick up girlsShe waited by the moon
She was sick with fear and cold
She felt too old for all of this
Of course she never showed
She lugged her suitcase to the bus
Melted home through the snow
North along riverside
She slips beneath the sheets
A husbands quiet devoted wife
But strangers sad and nervous
By the dawns early light
Loves lies like a dead cloud
On a shabby yellow lawn
Up on riverside
Shell drive the big car
Hell sit behind
Shell keep an eye on Jessica
South along the Hudson
Shell turn the radio high
Find a station playing sad sad soul
Just a little bit louder now
South along the Hudson yea
Just a little bit faster now
Just a little bit louder now
Just a little bit angry now
South along the Hudson yea
And shell drive the big car
And talk herself insane
Just a little bit louder now
Just a little bit angry now
Way back when Millennium
Meant racing to the light
He promised her a dream-life
Hed take her back to street-life
Away from violent water
With its Cormorants and leaves
Up on riverside
Shell drive the big car
But hell sit behind
Bursting her bubbles of Ludlow and Grand
South along the Hudson
Shell turn the radio way up high
Find a station playing sad sad soul
Just a little bit louder now
South along the Hudson
Just a little bit faster now
Just a little bit louder now
Just a little bit angry now
South along the Hudson yea
Just a little bit faster now
Just a little bit louder now
Just a little bit angry now
South along the Hudson yea
Shell drive the big car
Hell sit behind
Shell keep an eye on Jessica
Just a little bit faster now
Just a little bit faster nowStreets damp and warm
Empty smell metal
Weeds between buildings
Pictures on my hard drive
But Im the luckiest guy
Not the loneliest guy
Steam under floor
Shards by the mirrors frame
Clouds green and low
No sign no nothing now
But Im the luckiest guy
Not the loneliest guy
All the pages that have turned
All the errors left unlearned oh
Well Im the luckiest guy
Not the loneliest guy
In the world
Not me
Not meSilver leaves are spinning round
Take my hand as we go down and down and down
Looking for water
But I lost God in a New York minute
Dont know about you but my hearts not in it
Looking looking looking
Im looking for water
Im looking for water
Looking looking looking
I cant breathe the air
Cant raise the fight
Cause all weve got left is a beat in the night
And Im
Looking for water
Looking for water
Looking for water
Looking looking
Take my hand as we go down and down
Leave it all behind nothing will be found
Im looking for water
Im looking for water
Looking for water
Looking looking
Im looking for water
Looking everywhere
Looking for water
Looking here and there
Im looking for water
Im looking for water
Looking for water
Looking looking
I cant live in this cage
I cant eat this candy
To the ends of the Earth
To this pain in my head
The look in your eyes
That never means never
The dawns early light
Baby dumb is forever
Looking looking
Looking lookingHold me tight
Keep me cool
Going mad
Dont know what to do
Do I need a friend
Well I need one now
All the days of my life
All the days of my life
All the days I owe you
All Ive done
Ive done for me
All you gave
You gave for free
I gave nothing in return
And theres little left of me
All the days of my life
All the days of my life
All the days I owe you
In red-eyed pain Im knocking on your door again
My crazy brain in tangles
Pleading for your gentle voice
Those storms keep pounding through my head and heart
I pray youll soothe my sorry soul
All the days of my life
All the days of my life
All the days I owe you
All the days of my life
All the days of my life
All the days I owe you
All the days of my life
All the days of my life
All the days I owe youBetter take care
I think I better go I better get a room
Better take care of me
Again and again
I think about this and I think about personal history
Better take care
I breathe so deep when the movie gets real
When the star turns round
Again and again
He looks me in the eye says hes got his mind on a countdown
three two one
Forever
Im screaming that Im gonna be living on till the end of time
Forever
The sky splits open to a dull red skull
And my head hangs low cause its all over now
And theres never gonna be enough money
And theres never gonna be enough drugs
And Im never ever gonna get old
Theres never gonna be enough bullets
Theres never gonna be enough sex
And Im never ever gonna get old
So Im never ever gonna get high
And Im never ever gonna get low
And Im never ever gonna get old
Better take care
The moon flows on to the edges of the world because of you
Again and again
And Im awake in an age of light living it because of you
Better take care
Im looking at the future solid as a rock because of you
Again and again
want to be here and I want to be there
Living just like you living just like me
Forever
Putting on my gloves and bury my bones in the marshland
Forever
Think about my soul but I dont need a thing just the ring of the bell in the pure clean air
And Im running down the street of life
And Im never gonna let you die
And Im never ever gonna get old
And Im never ever gonna get
Im never ever gonna get
Im never ever gonna get old
And Im never ever gonna get
And Im never ever gonna get
Never ever gonna get oldHope little girl
Come blow me away
I dont care much
I win anyway
Just a dog
Im God damn rich
An exploding man
When I talk in the night
Theres oil on my hands
What a dog
Fall dog is cruel and smart
Smart time breaks the heart
Fall dog bombs the moon
Devil in a market place
Devil in your bleeding face
Fall dog bombs the moon
What a dog
Theres always a moron
Someone to hate
A corporate tie
A wig and a date
Just a dog
These blackest of years
That have no sound
No shape no depth
No underground
What a dog
Fall dog is cruel and smart
Smart time breaks the heart
Fall dog bombs the moon
A devil in a market place
A devil in your bleeding face
Fall dog bombs the moon
What a dogTragic youth was looking young and sexy
The tragic youth was wearing tattered black jeans
Bearing arms and flaunting all her mischief
The tragic youth was going down on me
And I swear
Woo hoo
Yes I swear
I built a wall of sound to separate us
And hid among the junk of wretched highs
I sped from Planet X to Planet Alpha
Struggling for reality
Ha ha ha ha
Woo hoo
Ha ha ha ha
Whoo hoo
Hey now my sight is failing in this twilight
Da da da da da da da da da
Now my death is more than just a sad song
Da da da da da da da da da
And I swear
Woo hoo
Yes I swear
Woo hoo
I still dont remember how this happened
I still dont get the wherefores and the whys
I look for sense but I get next to nothing
Hey boy welcome to reality
Ha ha ha ha
Woo hoo
Ive been right and Ive been wrong
Now Im back where I started from
Never looked over realitys shoulder
Ha ha ha ha
Huh ha ha ha
Woo hoo
Huh ha ha
Wooh
Woo hoo
WoohYou promised me the ending would be clear
Youd let me know when the time was now
Dont let me know when youre opening the door
Stab me in the dark let me disappear
Memories that flutter like bats out of hell
Stab you from the city spires
Life wasnt worth the balance
Or the crumpled paper it was written on
Dont let me know were invisible
Dont let me know were invisible
Hot cash days that you trailed around
Cold cold nights under chrome and glass
Led me down river of perfumed limbs
Sent me to the streets with the good time girls
Dont let me know were invisible
Dont let me know were invisible
We could dance dance dance through the fire
Dance dance dance through the fire
Feed me no lies
I dont know about you I dont know about you
Breathe through the years
I dont know about you I dont know about you
Bring me the disco king
I dont know about you I dont know about you
Dead or alive bring me the disco king
Bring me the disco king bring me the disco king
Bring me the disco king
Spin-offs with those who slept like corpses
Damp morning rays in the stiff bad clubs
Killing time in the seventys
Smelling of love through the moist winds
Dont let me know when youre opening the door
Close me in the dark let me disappear
Soon therell be nothing left of me
Nothing left to release
Dance dance dance through the fire
Dance dance dance through the fire
Feed me no lies
I dont know about you I dont know about you
Breathe through the years
I dont know about you I dont know about you
Bring me the disco king
I dont know about you I dont know about you
Dead or alive bring me the disco king
Bring me the disco king
Bring me the disco king bring me the disco king
Bring me the disco king bring me the disco king
Bring me the disco king bring me the disco kingSee the great white scar

I gotta feel it

You gotta feel it I gotta feel it
I wanna feel itThe children of the summers end
Gathered in the dampened grass
We played Our songs and felt the London sky
Resting on our hands
It was Gods land
It was ragged and naive
It was Heaven
Touch we touched the very soul
Of holding each and every life
We claimed the very source of joy ran through
It didnt but it seemed that way
I kissed a lot of people that day
Oh to capture just one drop of all the ecstasy that swept that afternoon
To paint that love upon a white balloon
And fly it from the toppest top of all the tops that man has pushed beyond his
Brain
Satoria must be something just the same
We scanned the skies with rainbow eyes and saw machines of every shape and size
We talked with tall Venusians passing through
And Peter tried to climb aboard but the Captain shook his head
And away they soared
Climbing through the ivory vibrant cloud
Someone passed some bliss among the crowd
And we walked back to the road unchainedWell its one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-nine OK
All across the USA
Its another year for me and you
Another year with nothing to do
Last year I was twenty-one
I didnt have a lot of fun
And now Im gonna be twenty-two
I say oh my and a boo-hoo
Its one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-nine OK all across the USA
Its another year for me and you
Another year with nothing to do
Another year with nothing to do
Its one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-nine

And its one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-nine baby

Throwing darts in lovers eyes
Here are we one magical moment such is the stuff
From where dreams are woven
Bending sound dredging the ocean lost in my circle
Here am I flashing no color
Tall in this room overlooking the ocean
Here are we one magical movement from Kether to Malkuth
There are you you drive like a demon from station to station
The return of the Thin White Duke throwing darts in lovers eyes
The return of the Thin White Duke throwing darts in lovers eyes
The return of the Thin White Duke making sure white stays
Once there were mountains on mountains
And once there were sun birds to soar with
And once I could never be down
Got to keep searching and searching
Oh what will I be believing and who will connect me with love
Wonderful wonderful wonder when
Have you sought fortune evasive and shy
Drink to the men who protect you and I
Drink drink drain your glass raise your glass high
Its not the side-effects of the cocaine
Im thinking that it must be love
Its too late to be grateful
Its too late to be late again
Its too late to be hateful
The European cannon is here
I must be only one in a million
I wont let the day pass without her
Its too late to be grateful
Its too late to be late again
Its too late to be hateful
The European cannon is here
Should I believe that Ive been stricken
Does my face show some kind of glow
Its too late to be grateful
Its too late to be late again
Its too late to be hateful
The European cannon is here yes its here
Its too late
Its too late its too late its too late its too late
The European cannon is here
Its not the side-effects of the cocaine
Im thinking that it must be love
Its too late to be grateful
Its too late to be late again
Its too late to be hateful
The European cannon is here
I must be only one in a million
I wont let the day pass without her
Its too late to be grateful
Its too late to be late again
Its too late to be hateful
The European cannon is here
Should I believe that Ive been stricken
Does my face show some kind of glow
Its too late to be grateful
Its too late to be late again
Its too late to be hateful
The European cannon is here yes its here
Its too late
Its too late its too late its too late its too late
The European cannon is hereIn this age of grand illusion
You walked into my life
Out of my dreams
I dont need another change
Still you forced your way
Into my scheme of things
You say were growing
Growing heart and soul
In this age of grand illusion
You walked into my life
Out of my dreams
Sweet name youre born once again for me
Sweet name youre born once again for me
Oh sweet name I call you again
Youre born once again for me
Just because I believe dont mean I dont think as well
Dont have to question everything
In heaven or hell
Lord I kneel and offer you
My word on a wing
And Im trying hard to fit among
Your scheme of things
Its safer than a strange land
But I still care for myself
And I dont stand in my own light
Lord Lord MY prayer flies
Like a word on a wing
My prayer flies
Like a word on a wing
Does my prayer fit in
With your scheme of things
In this age of grand illusion
You walked into my life
Out of my dreams
Sweet name youre born once again for me
Just as long as I can see Ill never stop this vision flowing
I look twice and youre still flowing
Just as long as I can walk
Ill walk beside you Im alive in you
Sweet name youre born once again for me
And Im ready to shape the scheme of things
Ooh ready to shape
The scheme of things
Ooh ready to shape

Lord I kneel and offer you
My word on a wing

Your scheme of things
Its safer than a strange land
But I still care for myself
And I dont stand in my own light
Oh Lord Lord Lord my prayer flies
Like a word on a wing
And Im trying hard to fit among
Your scheme of things
Its safer than a strange land
But I still care for myself
And I dont stand in my own light
Lord Lord my prayer flies
Like a word on a wing
My prayer flies like a word on a wing
Does my prayer fit in
With your scheme of thingsThis week dragged past me so slowly
The days fell on their knees
Maybe Ill take something to help me
Hope someone takes after me
I guess theres always some change in the weather
This time I know we could get it together
If I did casually mention tonight
That would be crazy tonight
Stay thats what I meant to say or do something
But I never say is stay this time
I really meant to so badly this time
Cause you can never really tell when somebody
Wants something you want too
Heartwrecker heartwrecker make me delight
Life is so vague when it brings someone new
This time tomorrow Ill know what to do
I know its happened to you
Stay thats what I meant to say or do something
But what I never say is stay this time
I really meant to so badly this time
Cause you can never really tell when somebody
Wants so much to stay
Thats what I meant to say or do something
But what I never say is stay this time
I really meant to so badly this time
Cause you can never really tell when somebody
Wants something you want tooLove me love me love me love me
Say you do
Let me fly away
With you
For my love is like

Yes were lovers and that is that
Though nothing will keep us together
We could steal time just for one day
We can be heroes forever and ever

Werden wir Helden
Fur einen Tag

Die Mauer Im RÃ¼cken war kalt
Schusse reissen die Luft
Doch wir kussen
Als ob nichts geschieht
Und die Scham fiel auf ihre seite
Oh wir konnen sie schlagen
Fur alle zeiten
Dann sind wir Helden
Fur diesen Tag
Dann sind wir Helden
Dann sind wir Helden

And nothing will help us
Maybe were lying
Then you better not stay
But we could be safer
Just for one day
Oh oh oh ohGround Control to Major Tom
Ground Control to Major Tom
Take your protein pills and put your helmet on
Ground Control to Major Tom ten nine eight seven six
Commencing countdown engines on five four three
Check ignition and may Gods love be with you two one liftoff
This is Ground Control to Major Tom
Youve really made the grade
And the papers want to know whose shirts you wear
Now its time to leave the capsule if you dare
This is Major Tom to Ground Control
Im stepping through the door
And Im floating in a most peculiar way
And the stars look very different today
For here
Am I sitting in a tin can
Far above the world
Planet Earth is blue
And theres nothing I can do
Though Im past one hundred thousand miles
Im feeling very still
And I think my spaceship knows which way to go
Tell my wife I love her very much she knows
Ground Control to Major Tom
Your circuits dead theres something wrong
Can you hear me Major Tom
Can you hear me Major Tom
Can you hear me Major Tom
Can you Here am I floating round my tin can
Far above the moon
Planet Earth is blue
And theres nothing I can doInstrumentalWell the joint was rocking
Going round n round
Yeah reeling and a-rocking
What a crazy sound
Well they never stopped rocking
Til the moon went down
Well it sounded so sweet
I had to take me a chance
I rose out of my seat
And had to dance
I started moving my feet
And clapping my hands
Yeah we kept on rocking
Going round n round
Yeah reeling and a-rocking
What a crazy sound
Well they never stopped rocking
Til the moon went down
About twelve oclock
When the place was packed
The front doors were locked
I said the place was packed
When the police knocked
Those doors flew back
But kept on rocking
Going round n round
Yeah reeling and a-rocking
What a crazy sound
Well they never stopped rocking
Til the moon went down
Yeah
About twelve oclock
Around lock up time
Well the doors were locked
Said the place was packed
When the police knocked
Those doors flew back
But it kept on rocking
Going round n round
Yeah reeling and a-rocking
What a crazy sound
Well they never stopped rocking
Til the moon went down
Yeah it kept on rocking
Going round n round
Yeah reeling and a-rocking
What a crazy sound
Well they never stopped rocking
Til the moon went downSolemn faced
The village settles down
Undetected by the stars
And the hangman plays the mandolin before he goes to sleep
And the last thing on his mind
Is the Wild Eyed Boy imprisoned
Neath the covered wooden shaft
Folds the rope
Into its bag
Blows his pipe of smolders
Blankets smoke into the room
And the day will end for some
As the night begins for one
Staring through the message in his eyes
Lies a solitary son
From the mountain called Freecloud
Where the eagle dare not fly
And the patience in his sigh
Gives no indication
For the townsmen to decide
So the village Dreadful yawns
Pronouncing gross diversion
As the label for the dog
Oh Its the madness in his eyes
As he breaks the night to cry
Its really Me
Really You
And really Me
Its so hard for us to really be
Really You
And really Me
Youll lose me though Im always
Really free
And the mountain moved its eyes
To the world of realize
Where the snow had saved a place
For the Wild Eyed Boy
From Freecloud
And the village dreadful cried
As the rope began to rise
For the smile stayed on the face
Of the Wild Eyed Boy
From Freecloud
And the women once proud
Clutched the heart of the crowd
As the boulders smashed down from the mountains hand
And the magic in the stare
Of the Wild Eyed Boy said
Stop Freecloud
They wont think to cut me down
But the cottages fell
Like a playing card hell
And the tears on the face
Of the Wise Boy
Came tumbling down
To the rumbling ground
And the missionary mystic of peacelove
Stumbled to cry among the clouds
Kicking back the pebbles
From the freecloud mountain trackInstrumentalINSTRUMENTALYou remind me of the babe

Your eyes can be so cruel
Just as I can be so cruel
Though I do believe in you
Yes I do
Live without the sunlight
Love without your heartbeat
I I cant live within you
I cant live within you
I I cant live within youAlways in trouble
Never to blame
Must be a double
You are the same

Doing the wrong thing
Forgetting your lines
Waiting for something better to shine

Ah yeah look ah
I was gettin in to thatOutside the storm clouds gathering
move silently along the dusty boulevard
where flowers turning crane
their fragile mane
so they can in turn reach up and kiss the sky
Theyre driven by a strange desire
unseen by the human eye
someones calling
I remember when you held my hand
in the park we would wait
when the circus came to town over here
Outside the circus gathering
moves silently along the rain swept bouledvard
the procession moves on the shouting is over
the fabulous freaks are leaving town
Theyre driven by a strange desire
unseen by the human eye
someones calling
The carnival is over
We sat and watched
as the moon rose
for the very first timeI had skin like leather and the diamond-hard look of a cobra
I was born blue and weathered but I burst just like a supernova
I could walk like Brando right into the sun
Then dance just like a Casanova
With my blackjack and jacket and hair slicked sweet
Silver star studs on my duds like a Harley in heat
When I strut down the street I could hear its heartbeat
The sisters fell back and said Dont that man look pretty
The cripple on the corner cried out Nickels for your pity
Them gasoline boys downtown sure talk gritty
Its so hard to be a saint in the city
I was the king of the alley mama I could talk some trash
I was the prince of the paupers crowned downtown at the beggars bash
I was the pimps main prophet I kept everything cool
Just a backstreet gambler with the luck to lose
And when the heat came down it was left on the ground
The devil appeared like Jesus through the steam in the street
Showin me a hand I knew even the cops couldnt beat
I felt his hot breath on my neck as I dove into the heat
Its so hard to be a saint when youre just a boy out on the street
And the sages of the subway sit just like the living dead
As the tracks clack out the rhythm their eyes fixed straight ahead
They ride the line of balance and hold on by just a thread
But its too hot in these tunnels you can get hit up by the heat
You get up to get out at your next stop but they push you back down in your seat
Your heart starts beatin faster as you struggle to your feet
Then youre outta that hole and back up on the street
And them South Side sisters sure look pretty
The cripple on the corner cries out Nickels for your pity
And them downtown boys sure talk gritty
Its so hard to be a saint in the citySomeday they wont let you but now you must agree
The times they are a-telling and the changing isnt free
Youve read it in the tea leaves the tracks are on TV
Beware the savage jaw
Of one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four
Theyll break your pretty cranium and fill it full of air
And tell you that youre eighty but lover you wont care
Youll be shooting up as usual like tomorrow wasnt there
Beware the savage jaw
Of one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four
Come see come see remember me
We played at an all night movie role
You said it would last but I guess we rolled
In one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four who could ask for more
one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four who could ask for more
Now we can talk in confidence
Did you guess that weve been done wrong
Lies jump in queue to be first in line
Such a shameless design
He thinks hes well screened from the man at the top
Its a shame that his children disagree
They coolly decide to sell him down the line
Daddys brainwashing time
Hes a dodo no no didnt hear it from me didnt hear it from me
Hes a dodo no no didnt hear it from me didnt hear it from me
Shes doesnt recall her blessed childhood of yore
When a unit was a figure not a she
When lovers chose each other seems the perks are due
Another memo to screw
Shes a dodo no no didnt hear it from me didnt hear it from me
Shes a dodo no no didnt hear it from me didnt hear it from me
Can you wipe your nose my child
Without them slotting in your file a photograph
Will you sleep in fear tonight
Wake to find the scorching light of neighbour Jim
Hes come to turn you in
Another dodo no no didnt hear it from me didnt hear it from me
Another dodo no no didnt hear it from me didnt hear it from me
Another dodo no no didnt hear it from me didnt hear it from me
Come see come see remember me
We played at an all night movie role
You said it would last but I guess we enrolled
In one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four who could ask for more
one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four who could ask for mor-or-or-or-ore
Mor-or-or-or-ore
one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four
one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four who could ask for more
one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four
one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four who could ask for more
one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four
one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four who could ask for more
one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four
OooooInstrumentalTheres such a sad look
In your eyes a kind of pale jewel
Open and closed within your eyes
I see the sky in your eyes
Theres such a fooled heart
Beating so fast in search of new dreams
A love that will last within your heart
Ill place the moon within your heart
As the pain sweeps through
Makes no sense for you
Every thrill has gone
Wasnt too much fun at all
But Ill be there for you
As the world falls down
Falling
As the world Falling down
Falling in love
Ill paint you mornings of gold
Ill spin you Valentine evenings
Though were strangers till now
Were choosing the path between the stars
Ill leave my love between the stars
As the pain sweeps through
Makes no sense for you
Every thrill has gone
Wasnt too much fun at all
But Ill be there for you
As the world falls down
Falling
As the world Falling down
Falling
As the world falls down
Falling

Red light green light

I loved her

Ive got to get away
but I loved her
Ahhh

Ill buy her anything
A big fat car a diamond ring
If she will be my girl

Ooh ah Kitty just you see
Dont put the blame on me oh no
I want my baby back oh no
I want my baby back oh noIts safe in the city to love in a doorway
To wrangle some screams from the dawn
And isnt it me putting pain in a stranger
Like a portrait in flesh who trails on a leash
Will you see that Im scared and Im lonely
So Ill break up my room and yawn and I
Run to the center of things
Where the knowing one says
Boys Boys its a sweet thing
Boys Boys its a sweet thing sweet thing
If you want it Boys get it here thing
Cause hope Boys is a cheap thing cheap thing
Im glad that youre older than me
Makes me feel important and free
Does that make you smile isnt that me
Im in your way and Ill steal every moment
If this trade is a curse then Ill bless you
And turn to the crossroads of Hamburg as in
Boys Boys its a sweet thing
Boys Boys its a sweet thing sweet thing
If you want it Boys get it here thing
Cause hope Boys is a cheap thing cheap thing
Part Two Candidate
Ill make you a deal like any other candidate
Well pretend were walking home cause your futures at stake
My set is amazing it even smells like a street
Theres a bar at the end where I can meet you and your friend
Someone scrawled on the wall I smell the blood of Les Tricoteuses
Who wrote up scandals in other bars
Im having so much fun with the poisonous people
Spreading rumors and lies and stories they made up
Some make you sing and some make you scream
One makes you wish that youd never been seen
But theres a shop on the corner thats selling papier mache
Making bullet-proof faces Charlie Manson Cassius Clay
If you want it Boys get it here thing
So you scream out of line
I want you I need you Anyone out there Any time
Tres butch little number whines Hey dirty I want you
When its good its really good and when its bad I go to pieces
If you want it Boys get it here thing
Well on the street where you live I could not hold up my head
For I put all I have in another bed
On another floor in the back of a car
In the cellar of a church with the door ajar
Well I guess we must be looking for a different kind
But we cant stop trying til we break up our minds
Til the sun drips blood on the seedy young knights
Who press you on the ground while shaking in fright
I guess we could cruise down one more time
With you by my side it should be fine
Well buy some drugs and watch a band
Then jump in the river holding hands
Part Three Sweet Thing Reprise
If you want it boys get it here thing
Cause hope boys is a cheap thing cheap thing
Is it nice in your snow storm freezing your brain
Do you think that your face looks the same
Then let it be its all I ever wanted
Its a street with a deal and a taste
Its got claws its got me its got you Your coat and hat are gone
I really cant look at your little empty shelf
A ragged teddy bear
It feels like we never had a chance
Dont look me in the eye
We lay in each others arms
But the room is just an empty space
I guess we lived it out
Something in the air
We smile too fast
Then cant think of a thing to say
Lived with the best times
Left with the worst
Danced with you too long
Nothing left to save
Lets take what we can
I know youll hold your head up high
Weve raged for the last time
A place of no return
And theres something in the air
Something in my eye
Ive danced with you too long
Yeah
Something in the air
Something in my eye
Abracadoo I lose you
We cant avoid the clash the big mistake
Now were going to pay and pay
The sentence of our lives
Cant believe Im asking you to go
We used what we could
To get the things we want
But we lost each other on the way
I guess you know I never wanted anyone more than you
Lived all our best times
Left with the worst
Ive danced with you too long
Say what you will
Theres something in the air
Raged for the last time
But I know youll hold your head up high
Theres nothing we have to say
Theres nothing in our eyes
But theres something in the air
Something in my eye
I danced with you too long
Theres something I have to say
Theres something in the air
Something in my eye
Ive danced with you too long
Danced with you too long
Danced with you too long
And theres something in the air
Something in the airI was Ramona A Stone
I started with no enemies of my own
I was an artiste
In a tunnel
But Ive been having a mid-life crisis
And Ive been dreaming of sleep
And ape men made with metal parts
Ive spat upon deeply felt age
Ive hid my hearts in
And I hate the funny colored English
Well creep together you and I
For I know who the small friends are
I am with name I am with name
I am Ramona A Stone
A night fear female good timing drone
I am with name I am with name
I am with name I am with name
I am Ramona A Stone
She should say
Twitch and stream itll end in chrome
The night of the female
Good time drone
I am with name
I am Ramona A Stone
She should say
I am with name
I am Ramona A Stone
A person who loses a name
Feels anxiety descending
Left at the crossroads between the centuries
A millennium fetish
I am with name I am with name
I am Ramona A Stone
I am with name
Night fear female good timing drone
I am with name
I am Ramona A Stone
Give it to me one more time
Anxiety descending
Anxiety descendingThough the idea of confession it is said to be
The union of and his bride the Christian

All the great mystic religions put strong emphasis
On the redeeming spiritual qualities of sex of sex
Christianity has been pretty modern about sex
Of sex of sex of sex of sex

Bleeds like a craze Dad

Easy come come gotta back
In the valley of the dead man walks
How they drank from the jazz
Astral Kestrel
Fed into the featherfall
Fed him on a pencil carving
You will never get

Bleed like a craze Dad

Shine shine shine
Bleed like a craze Dad
These are the craze
Seek for a leather journey
Never stopped to think about

Looking to the parlous parlors
Party on the dead
Put a net through his headache

Watch me while you can
Been trawling too long Ive been losing out strong
For the strength of another man
Ive been hasty wasty standing on the backstep
Waiting for the phone to ring
But this semi-acoustic love affair
Is driving me to the brink
Im just looking for a friend
Im just looking for a friend
You dont have to be a big wheel you dont have to be the end
Im just looking for looking for a friend
God help all you ladies
May the devil take all you men
Youre far too busy having babies
To help yourselves to a friend
Youre lazy crazy hung upon the insane
Waiting for the phone to ring
Incomprehensible
Incomprehensible the wall
Im just looking for a friend
Im just looking for a friend
You dont have to be a big wheel you dont have to be the end
Im just looking for looking for a friend looking

You dont have to be a big wheel you dont have to be the end
Im just looking for looking for a friendThe children of the summers end
Gathered in the dampened grass
We played Our songs and felt the London sky
Resting on our hands
It was Gods land
It was ragged and naive
It was Heaven
Touch we touched the very soul
Of holding each and every life
We claimed the very source of joy ran through
It didnt but it seemed that way
I kissed a lot of people that day
Oh to capture just one drop of all the ecstasy that swept that afternoon
To paint that love upon a white balloon
And fly it from the toppest top of all the tops that man has pushed beyond his
Brain
Satoria must be something just the same
We scanned the skies with rainbow eyes and saw machines of every shape and size
We talked with tall Venusians passing through
And Peter tried to climb aboard but the Captain shook his head
And away they soared
Climbing through the ivory vibrant cloud
Someone passed some bliss among the crowd
And we walked back to the road unchainedfive hundred and fifteen
Im changing trains
This little town
Let me down
This foreign rain
Brings me down

DuhTook a trip on a Gemini spacecraft
And I thought about you
I passed through the shadow of Jupiter
And I thought about you
I shot my space gun
And boy I really felt blue
Two or three flying saucers
Parked under the stars winding stream
Moon shining down on some little town
And with each beam the same old dream
I took a trip on a Gemini spacecraft
And I thought about you
Well I shot my spacegun
And I thought about you
Pulled down my sun visor
Boy I really felt blue
You jumped into your Gemini I jumped into mine
Well orbit the Moon for just one time
Tomorrow night tomorrow night
Will you hold hands with me under the moonlight
Took a trip in a Gemini spacecraft
And I thought about you
I shot my space gun
And I thought about you
And I took a I took a walk in space

Well I peeked through the crack and looked way back
Stardust trail leading back to you

Well

Did you guess that weve been done wrong
Lies jumped the queue to be first in line
Such a shameless design
He thinks hes well screened from the man at the top
Its a shame that his children disagree
They coolly decide to sell him down the line
Daddys brainwashing time
Hes a dodo no no didnt hear it from me
Hes a dodo no no didnt hear it from me
Shes quite enthralled with the childhood of yore
When a unit was a figure not a she
When lovers chose each other now the perks are due
Another memo to screw
Shes a dodo no no didnt hear it from me
Shes a dodo no no didnt hear it from me
Can you wipe your nose my child
Without them slotting in your file a photograph
Can you sleep alone at night
Wake to find the scorching light of neighbor Jim
Hes come to turn you in
Another dodo no no didnt hear it from me
Another dodo no no didnt hear it from me
Another dodo didnt hear it from meStinky weather fat shaky hands

Who believes at where he is
And theres a girl
Up ahead who says she knows
And the street overflows
With the folk who understand
But for the guy who cant be seen
Hes the Shadow Man
And the Shadow Man is close at hand
Take a turn and see his smile
Made of nothing but loneliness
Just take a walk and be a friend
To the Shadow Man
You can call him Joe you can call him Sam
You should call and see who answers
For he promises to come running guided by the truth
But the Shadow Man is really you
Look in his eyes and see your reflection
Look to the stars and see his eyes
Hell show you tomorrow hell show you the sorrows
Of what you did today
You can call him foe you can call him friend
You should call and see who answers
For he knows your eyes are drawn to the road ahead
And the Shadow Man is waiting round the bend
Oh the Shadow Man
Ohooooo oooo
Shadow man shadow man
Its really you its really you its really you
Hes the shadow man
Oh yeah
Shadow manHallo Spaceboy youre sleepy now second time Hallo

Because the years of fretting days are right behind you now
Dont return to fields of green where rainbow secrets were told
Place your ragged doll with all the toys and things and deeds
I will show you a game where the winner never wins
Let your hair hang down wear the dress your mother wore
Let me sleep beside you
Lock away your childhood and throw away the key
For now the streets and city sounds will burn your eyes as coals
We shall drink the oldest wine and velvet skies will linger
Child youre a woman now your heart and soul are free
I will boldly light that lamp and we shall walk together
Let your hair hang down wear the dress your mother wore
Let me sleep beside you
Your darkened eyes throw mystery
But your lips are void of history
You could not imagine that it could happen this way could you
I will give you dreams and Ill tell you things youll like to hear
Let your hair hang down wear the dress your mother wore
Let me sleep beside you
Let me sleep beside youYouve got a habit of leaving me
And youve got a habit of deserting me
Sometimes I cry
Sometimes Im so sad
Sometimes Im so glad so glad
You could go on if you wanted to wanted to wanted to
Wanted to

Youve got a habit of leaving me
And youve got a habit of deserting me
Sometimes I cry

Sometimes Im so glad so glad

A nation in his eyes
Striped with blood and emblazed tattoo
Streaking cathedral spire
They say
He has no brain
They say
He has no mood
They say
He was born again
They say
Look at him climb
They say jump
They say
He has two gods
They say
He has no fear
They say
He has no eyes
They say
He has no mouth
They say hey thats really something
They feel he should get some time
I say he should watch his ass
My friend dont listen to the crowd
They say jumpSue I got the job
Well buy the house
Youll need to rest
But now well make it
Sue the clinic called
The x-rays fine
I brought you home
I just said home
Sue you said you wanted writ
Sue the virgin on your stone
For your grave
Why too dark to speak the words
Fore I know that you have a son
Oh folly Sue
Ride the train Im far from home
In a season of crime none need atone
I kissed your face
Sue I pushed you down beneath the weeds
Endless faith in hopeless deeds
I kissed your face
I touched your face
Sue goodbye
Sue I found your note
That you wrote last night
It cant be right
You went with him
Sue I never dreamed
Im such a fool
Right from the start
You went with that clownOh my
Naked eyes
I should have kept you
I should have tried
I should have been a wiser kind of guy
I miss you
Give me wings
Give me space
Give me money for a change of face
Those noisy rooms and passion pants
I loved you
Wheres the morning in my life
Wheres the sense in staying right
Who said time is on my side
Ive got ears and eyes and nothing in my life
But Ill survive your naked eyes
Ill survive
You alone across the floor
You and me and nothing more
Youre the great mistake I never made
I never lied to you I hated when you lied
But Ill survive your naked eyes
Ill survive
Beatle boys all snowy white
Razzle dazzle clubs every night
Wish Id sent a Valentine
I love you
Ill survive
Naked eyes
Ill survive
Ill survive
My naked eyes
Ill survive
Ill survive
Naked eyes
Ill survive
Ill survive
Ill surviveIve never sailed on a sea
I would not challenge a giant
I could not take on the church
Time will crawl
Til the twenty-onest century lose
I know a government man
He was as blind as the moon
He saw the sun in the night
He took a top-gun pilot
He made him fly through a hole
Til he grew real old
And he never came down
He just flew til he burst
Time will crawl til our mouths run dry
Time will crawl til our feet grow small
Time will crawl til our tails fall off
Time will crawl til the twenty-onest century lose
I saw a black black stream
Full of white eyed fish
And a drowning man
With no eyes at all
I felt a warm warm breeze
That melted metal and steel
I got a bad migraine
That lasted three long years
And the pills that I took
Made my fingers disappear
Time will crawl time will crawl
Time will crawl
Til the twenty-onest century lose
You were a talented child
You came to live in our town
We never bothered to scream
When your mask came off
We only smelt the gas
As we lay down to sleep
Time will crawl and our heads bowed down
Time will crawl and our eyes fall out
Time will crawl and the streets run red
Time will crawl til the twenty-onest century lose
Time will crawl and our mouths run dry
Time will crawl and our feet grow small
Time will crawl and our tails fall off
Time will crawl til the twenty-onest century lose
Time will crawl and our heads bowed down
Time will crawl and our eyes fall out
Time will crawl and the streets run red
Time will crawl til the twenty-onest century lose
For the crazy child
Well give every life
For the crackpot notionSaid youd took a big trip
They said you moved away
Happened oh so quietly they say
Shouldve took a picture
Something I could keep
Buy a little frame something cheap
For you
Everyone says hi
Said you sailed a big ship
Said you sailed away
Didnt know the right thing to say
Id love to get a letter
Like to know whats what
Hope the weathers good and its not too hot
For you
Everyone says hi
Everyone says hi

Hold your mad hands I cried
Tis a pity she was a whore
Tis my curse I suppose
That was patrol
That was patrol
This is the war
Black struck the kiss she kept my cock
Smote the mistress drifting on
Tis a pity she was a whore
She stole my purse with rattling speed
That was patrol
This is the war
Tis a pity she was a whore
Man she punched me like a dude
Hold your mad hands I cried
Tis a pity she was a whore
Tis my fate I suppose
For that was patrol
That was patrol
Tis a pity she was a whore
Tis a pity she was a whoreLiving in lies by the railway line
Pushing the hair from my eyes
Elvis is English and climbs the hills
Cant tell the bullshit from the lies
Screaming along in South London
Vicious but ready to learn
Sometimes I fear that the whole world is queer
Sometimes but always in vain
So Ill wait until were sane
Wait until were blessed and all the same
Full of blood loving life and all its got to give
Englishmen going insane
Down on my knees in Suburbia
Down on myself in every way
With great expectations I change all my clothes
Mustnt grumble at silver and gold
Screaming above Central London
Never bored so Ill never get old
So Ill wait until were sane
Wait until were blessed and all the same
Full of blood loving life and all its got to give
Englishmen going insane
Down on my knees in suburbia
Down on myself in every way
Day after day after day day after
Zane Zane Zane Ouvre le chien
Day after day day after
Zane Zane Zane Ouvre le chien
Day afterHere shall we live in this terrible town
Where the price for our minds
shall squeeze them tight like a fist
And the walls shall have eyes
And the doors shall have ears
But well dance in their dark
And theyll play with our lives
Like a Slow Burn
Leading us on and on and on
Like a Slow Burn
Turning us round and round and round Hark who are we
So small in times such as these
Slow Burn
Slow Burn
Oh these are the days
These are the strangest of all
These are the nights
These are the darkest to fall
But who knows
Echoes in tenement halls
Who knows
Though the years spare them all
Like a Slow Burn
Leading us on and on and on
Like a Slow Burn
Twirling us round and round
and upside down
Theres fear overhead
Theres fear overground
Slow Burn
Slow Burn
Like a Slow Burn
Leading us on and on and on
Like a Slow Burn
Turning us round and round and
Round And here are we
At the center of it all
Slow Burn
Slow Burn
Slow BurnI forgot what my father said
I forgot what he said
I forgot what my mother said
As we lay upon your bed
A city full of flowers
A city full of rain
I got seven days to live my life
Or seven ways to die
I forgot what my brother said
I forgot what he said
I dont regret anything at all
I remember how we wept
On a bridge of violent people
I was small enough to cry
I got seven days to live my life
Or seven ways to die
Hold my face before you
Still my trembling heart
Seven days to live my life
Or seven ways to die
The gods forgot they made me
So I forget them too
I listen to the shadows
I play among their graves
My heart was never broken
My patience never tried
I got seven days to live my life
Or seven ways to die
Seven days to live my life
Or seven ways to die
SevenWhen I believed in nothing I called her name
Trapped in a high-dollar joint in some place I called her name
And though my days are slipping by
And nights so cruel I thought Id die
She danced her little dance till it made me cry
She was shakin like this honey doing that
When I needed soul revival I called your name
When I was falling to pieces I screamed in pain
Your soothing hand that turned me round
A love so real swept over me
You danced your little dance till it made me cry
You were shakin like this honey doing that
Never let me down
She never let me down
Never let me down
She never let me down
When all your faith is failing
Call my name
When youve nothing coming
Call my name
Ill be strong for all it takes
Ill cover your head till the bad stuff breaks
Ill dance my little dance till it makes you smile
Shaking like this honey doing that
Never let you down
Ill never let you down
Ill never let you down
Ill never let you downWow this aint the right thing to do so lets go
Young girls they know what theyre after
Young girls dont kiss me goodbye
Rockets shooting up into space
Buildings they rise to the skies
Bang Bang I got mine
Bang Bang reach for the sky
I keep a good friend on videotape
Hell drive his sports car until its too late
But well have a hot time on the town tonight
Cause love is my bet and its the best yet
Bang Bang I got mine
Bang Bang sun dont shine
Bang Bang you all angels
Bang Bang now you all ought to be in pictures
Oh girl
Oh girl my problems cant follow me
Phone calls I take my machine
I wander lonely to the sea
Lonely-Ha Ha-what does it mean
Bang Bang I got mine
Bang Bang and you are next in line
Bang Bang reach for the sky
Bang Bang sun dont shine
Rise buildings
Rise to the sky
Young girls they know what theyre after

A lovers secrets in the UK
Torn apart in the UK
In the dribble of May-Day
eighty-seven and Cry
eighty-seven and Cry
And theres nothing inside
And theres nothing in mind
And only you
Rocket on through the sky
It couldnt be done without dogs
It couldnt be once without us
eighty-seven and Cry
eighty-seven and Cry
When the days were the days were the days boys
When blue ties were for the biggy guys
Frannie dressing down for the enemy
You saw him hangin on the enemy
And theres no one in love
And theres nowhere to scream
And only you
Race on to wonder where
It couldnt be done without dogs
It couldnt be once without us
eighty-seven and Cry
eighty-seven and Cry
You cant make love with money
You cant make mistakes with babies
Nothing looked good on you
Thats how I liked you best
Now youre ready for the real McCoy
Deep in the heart of Cupid
Murders on the heels of love
Just the ghost of a story
Just a one dollar secret
Baby these were the sounds
Baby these were the sounds
And only you
Whisper these things arent true
It couldnt be done with dogs
It couldnt be once without us
eighty-seven and Cry
eighty-seven and CryEddie boy lit like paraffin
Spending two weeks
In a crack house
Burns on his brain
Like Chernobyl
Dean was seen
With a two bag purchase
He was lying dead on his mothers bed
Someone for pray for-
Till I met you
Life is like a broken arrow-
Memory a swingin door
I could be your great misfortune-
I can make you happy
Every day of your life
Making my love
Like a shining star
Takin my love just a touch too far
Tessie turns tricks with a soul like ice
Cause love left holes
And four swell kids breaking her heart
Ive got windows Ive seen much vice
Ive touched down with vermin
Cowardice lice
And I say
Nobody cares what you do-
Please be yourself to death
I could be your great misfortune
But youll never find a bet youll never find a better man
Making my love
Like a shining star
Taking my love just a touch too far
Peter met Frank
Formed a dummy run gang
Worked heist or hit for ten gs flat
Blew heads outta shape for the name of Trotsky Sinn-
Fein Hitler cashdown
No hope heroes cover the page
With debts in hell
And fingers in blood
Poor little bodies all covered in scabs
Threw it all away
Another life in the grave
Another life in the grave
Life is like a broken arrow-
Memory a swingin door
I could be your great misfortune-
Well I could make you happy
Every goddamn single day of your life
Making my love
Like a shining star
Like a shining star
Baby thats what you are
Like a shining star
Making my love
Like a shining star
Taking my love
Just a touch too farDo you see that thing
Im sure its love
Would you do one thing
New Yorks in love
The city grew wings in the back of the night
The clouds are stuck like candy-floss
She sees the rich trash having all the fun
Makes her wonder where they get the energy from
Theres nothing you can do to her
This citys all clean and waiting
I dont mean to wait too long
But this joint cant get much higher
CHORUS
New Yorks in love-
With her big green eyes
And her long blonde hair
New Yorks in flames
New Yorks in love
With the way she talks
And the way she walks
New Yorks in love
Goo Goo Goo Goo Goo Goo
My oh my its a tom-tom beat
No-one knows theyve had their day
We can dance and we can see the singles swing
Everybodys waiting for the Go-Go Boys
Youre turned to stone by the family
Its now the dead speak to the living
Nothing left here but a raging blaze
I dont mean to wait too long
CHORUS
New Yorks in love-
With her big green eyes
And her long blonde hair

With the way she talks
And the way she walks

Fashions may change heaven knows but you still leave a stain on me
Supplement queen your colours may fade
Seasons may change weather blows but you still leave a mark on me
Wrong-negative fades-never the twain reckless and tame
I like the beat of your drum
I like to look in your eyes
I like to look through your things
Id like to beat on your drum
I like the smell of your flesh
I like the dirt that you dish
I like the clothes that you wear
Id like to beat on your drum
Disco brat-follow the pack
Watching you peel heaven knows prison cant hold all this greedy intention
Vanitys child-picture you now
Music may change-hi-di-ho keen to follow your nose
Wrong-love out of tune
Sweet is the night bright light destroys me

In the Zi Duang provence of eastern country
A glass-like spider
Having devoured its prey it would drape the skeletons over its web
In weeks creating a macabre
Shrine of remains
Its web was also unique in that it had many layers
Like floors in a building
At the top of this palace-like place assembled with almost apparent
Care were tiny shining objects glass beads dew-drops
One could almost call it an altar
When the breeze blew through this construction
It produced sounds of wailing crying
Tiny wails tiny cries
The baby spiders would get scared and search frantically
For their mother
But the Glass Spider would have long gone having known that the babies
Would survive someone on their own
Oh-The Glass Spider had blue eyes almost like-a humans
They shed tears at the wintered turn of the centuries
Dont you hear this wasted cry Life is over you
Mummy come back cause the waters all gone
But youve seen whos in heaven Is there anyone in hell
Mummy come back cause its dark now
Take care take care
Mummy come back cause the waters all gone
Somewhere she glows divine Somewhere she wakes alone
But you youve promise in your lovin eye God its dark now
Jah Jah Jah Jah Jah

Gone Gone the waters all gone
Mummy come back cause the waters all gone
Stay low on the ground fire can drive you savage and afraid
Spitting the dawn come come come along before the animals awake
Run run weve been moving all night rivers to the left
If your mother dont love you then the riverbed might
Gone gone the waters all gone
Mummy come back cause the waters all gone
Jah Jah Jah Jah Jah

Gone gone the waters all gone
Mummy come back cause the waters all goneTheres too much talking for a night drive

The need to move on
So I pack a bag
And move on
Move on
Well I might take a train
Or sail at dawn
Might take a girl
When I move on
When I move on
Somewhere someones calling me
And when the chips are down
Im just a travelling man
Maybe its just a trick of the mind but
Somewhere theres a morning sky
Bluer than her eyes
Somewhere theres an ocean
Innocent and wild
Africa is sleepy people
Russia has its horsemen
Spent some nights in old Kyoto
Sleeping on the matted ground
Cyprus is my island
When the goings rough
I would love to find you
Somewhere in a place like that
Somewhere someones calling me
And when the chips are down
I stumble like a blind man
Cant forget you
Cant forget you
Feeling like a shadow
Drifting like a leaf
I stumble like a blind man
Cant forget you
Cant forget you
Cant forget you
Cant forget youIm home lost my job and incurably Ill

that this fantastic voyage
Should turn to erosion
and we never get old
Remember its true dignity is valuable
But our lives are valuable too
Were learning to live with somebodys depression
And I dont want to live with somebodys depression
Well get by I suppose
Its a very modern world
but nobodys perfect
Its a moving world
but thats no reason
To shoot some of those missiles
Think of us as fatherless scum
It wont be forgotten
Cause well never say anything nice again will we
And the wrong words make you listen
In this criminal world
Remember its true loyalty is valuable
But our lives are valuable tooJohnny is a man
And hes bigger than you
But his overheads are high
And he looks straight through when you ask him how the kids are
Hell get home around seven
Cause the chevys real old
And he could have had a cadillac
If the school had taught him right
And he could have married Anne with the blue silk blouse
He could have married Anne with the blue silk blouse
And the food is on the table
But the food is cold
Dont hit her
Cant you even cook
Whats the good of me working when you cant damn cook
Well Johnny is a man
And hes bigger than her
I guess the bruises wont show
If she wears long sleeves
But the space in her eyes shows through
And he could have married Anne with the blue silk blouse
He could have married Anne with the blue silk blouse
Shows through
Shows through
Shows throughHeaven loves ya
The clouds part for ya
Nothing stands in your way
When youre a boy
Clothes always fit ya
Life is a pop of the cherry
When youre a boy
When youre a boy
You can wear a uniform
When youre a boy
Other boys check you out
You get a girl
These are your favorite things
When youre a boy
Boys
Boys
Boys keep swinging
Boys always work it out
Uncage the colors
Unfurl the flag
Luck just kissed you hello
When youre a boy
Theyll never clone ya
Youre always first on the line
When youre a boy
When youre a boy
You can buy a home of your own
When youre a boy
Learn to drive and everything
Youll get your share
When youre a boy

Boys keep swinging
Boys always work it outCHORUS
Yassassin - Im not a moody guy
Yassassin - I walk without a sound
Yassassin -
Just a working man no judge of men
Yassassin -
But such a life Ive never known
We came from the farmlands
To live in this city
We walked proud and lustful
In this resonant world
You want to fight
But I dont want to leave
Or drift away
CHORUS
Look at this - no second glances
Look at this - no value of love
Look at this - just sun and steel
Look at this - then look at us
If theres someone in charge
Then listen to me
Dont say nothings wrong
Cause Ive got a love
And shes afeared
You want to fight
But I dont want to leave
Or drift away
CHORUS
Yassassin Yassassin YassassinYou know who I am he said
The speaker was an angel
He coughed and shook his crumpled wings
Closed his eyes and moved his lips
Its time we should be going
Waiting so long Ive been waiting so waiting so
Look back in anger driven by the night
Till you come
Waiting so long Ive been waiting so waiting so
Look back in anger see it in my eyes
Till you come
No one seemed to hear him
So he leafed through a magazine
And yawning rubbed the sleep away
Very sane he seemed to me
Waiting so long Ive been waiting so waiting so
Look back in anger driven by the night
Till you come
Waiting so long Ive been waiting so waiting so
Look back in anger feel it in my voice
Till you comeAfrican nightmare one-time Mormon
More men fall in Hullabaloo men
I slide to the nearest bar
Undermine chairman I went too far
Bent on a windfall rent a sony
Wonder how the dollar went down
Gotta get a word to Elizabeths father
Hey no he wished me well
Seemed like another day
I could fly into the eye of god on high
His burning eye will see me through
One of these days one of these days
Gotta get a word through one of these days
Asanti habari habari habari
Asanti nabana nabana nabana
Getting in mood for a Mombassa night flight
Pushing my luck gonna fly like a mad thing
Bare strip takeoff skimming over Rhino
Born in slumber less than peace
Struggle with a child whose screaming dreaming
Drowned by the props all steely sunshine
Sick of you sick of me
Lust for the free life
Quashed and maimed
Like a valuable loved one
Left unnamed
Seemed like another day
I could fly into the eye of god on high
Seemed like another day
I could fly into the eye of god on high
Over the bushland over the trees
Wise like Orangutan that was me
His burning eye will see me through
One of these days one of these days
Gotta get a word through one of these days
His burning eye will see me through
One of these days one of these days
Gotta get a word through one of these days
Asanti habari habari habari
Asanti nabana nabana nabana
