Mr Ruskin come and paint my picture
Were losing sleep cos we steal the week
Now whos your best friend
Can you introduce me
See I cant seem to even let you breathe
When I dance with Billy Ruskin in my minds eye
Please let me forget that Im standing on my own
And I am my own best friend and I need me to see
That I am more than what is hiding in me
Come and show me if you can
See I know youre me
But I cant seem to understand
If you know me place my hand on mine
And we will resurrect the time
That we lost when you left my mind
Its psycho-paranoia disappearing in time
Come and show me what makes you tick
I need you to get out of my mind quick
When I dance with Billy Ruskin in my minds eye
Please let me forget that Im standing on my own
And I am my own best friend and I need me to see
That I am more than what is hiding in meMade of clay
Shoot me down
Ill ricochet to the ground
Words of paint
Draw me out
And fill me in with your mouth
And hold your tongue
And I know its over before its begun
I lost my way
So help me out
And lend your hand til I am found
My voice is mute
Not to be heard
So its up to you
For you to bring those words
I
And I
Have come undone
For the last time
This grief you give
It takes its toll
It dries my heart and drowns my soul
I am a tree
Whose branch you broke
The brittle wood has turned stones oh
I
And I
Have come undone
For the last time
For the last time
For the last time
I
And I
Have come undone
For the last time
For the last time
For the last timeOh misty eye of the mountain below
Keep careful watch of my brothers souls
And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke
Keep watching over Durins sons
If this is to end in fire
Then we should all burn together
Watch the flames climb high into the night
Calling out father oh stand by and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on
The mountain side high
And if we should die tonight
We should all die together
Raise a glass of wine for the last time
Calling out father oh
Prepare as we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on
The mountain side
Desolation comes upon the sky
Now I see fire
Inside the mountain
I see fire
Burning the trees
And I see fire
Hollowing souls
I see fire
Blood in the breeze
And i hope that youll remember me
Oh should my people fall then
Surely Ill do the same
Confined in mountain halls
We got too close to the flame
Calling out father oh
Hold fast and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on
The mountain side
Desolation comes upon the sky
Now I see fire
Inside the mountains
I see fire
Burning the trees
And I see fire
Hollowing souls
I see fire
Blood in the breeze
And I hope that youll remember me
And if the night is burning
I will cover my eyes
For if the dark returns then
My brothers will die
And as the sky is falling down
It crashed into this lonely town
And with that shadow upon the ground
I hear my people screaming out
And I see fire
Inside the mountains
I see fire
Burning the trees
I see fire
Hollowing souls
I see fire
Blood in the breeze
I see fire fire
Oh you know I saw a city burning out
And I see fire fire
Feel the heat upon my skin
And I see fire fire
Uhhhhhhhhh
And I see fire
Burn auburn on the mountain sideShorty get down good Lord

No diggity I got to bag it upIf you were here beside me
Instead of in New York
If the curve of you was curved on me
Id tell you that I loved you
Before I even knew you
Cause I loved the simple thought of you
If our hearts had never broken
Well theres no joy in the mending
So much this hurt can teach us both
Theres distance and theres silence
Your words have never left me
Theyre the prayer that I say every day
Come on come out come here come here
Come on come out come here come here
Come on come out come here come here
Come on come out come here come here
The lone neon lights
And the heat of the ocean
And the fire that had started to spark
I miss it all from the love to the lightning
And the lack of it snaps me in two
If you were here beside me
Instead of New York
In the arms you said youd never leave
Id tell you that its simple
And it was only ever thus
There is nowhere else that I belong
Come on come out come here come here
Come on come out come here come here
Come on come out come here come here
Come on come out come here come here
The lone neon lights
And the want of the ocean
And the fire that had started to spark
I miss it all from the love to the lightning
And the lack of it snaps me in two
Just give me a sign
There is end in a beginning
Til the quiet chaos driving me mad
The lone neon lights
And the want of the ocean
And the fire that had started to go outNow Im in town break it down thinking of making a new sound
Playing a different show every night in front of a new crowd
Thats you now ciao seems that life is great now
See me lose focus as I sing to you loud
And I cant no I wont hush
Ill say the words that make you blush
Im gonna sing this now
See Im true my songs are where my heart is
Im like glue I stick to other artists
Im not you now that would be disastrous
Let me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures
See Im real I do it all its all me
Im not fake dont ever call me lazy
I wont stay put give me the chance to be free
Suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me
Cause you need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you at all
You need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you at all
You need me
I sing and write my own tune
And I write my own verso
Dont need another word-smith to make my tune sell
Call yourself a singer-writer Youre just bluffing
Your names on the credits and you didnt write nothing
I sing fast I know that all my shits cool
I will blast and I didnt go to Brit School
I came fast with the way I act right
I cant last if Im smoking on a crack pipe
And I wont be a product of my genre
My mind will always be stronger than my songs are
Never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya
Always read the stories that you hear on Wikipedia
And musically Im demonstrating
When I perform live feels like I am meditating
Times at the Enterprise when some fella filmed me
A young singer-writer like Gabriella Cilmi
Cause you need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you at all
You need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you at all
You need me
Cause with the lyrics Ill be aiming it right
I wont stop till my names in light
At Stadium Heights with Damien Rice
On red carpets now Im on arabian nights
Because Im young and all my brothers gonna give me advice
Long nighter short height and Im gone hyper
Never be anything but a singer-songwriter
The games over but now Im on a new level
Watch how I step on the track without a loop pedal
People think that Im bound to blow up
Ive done around about a thousand shows
But I havent got a house plus I live on the couch
So you can be the lyrics when Im singing them out wow
From day one Ive been prepared
With Vfive wax for my ginger hair
So now Im back to the sofa giving a dose of what the future holds
Cause its another day plus Ill keep my last name forever keep the genre pretty basic
Gonna be breaking into other peoples tunes when I chase it
And replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift
Into another rappers shoes using new laces
Selling cds from my rucksack aiming for the papers
Selling cds from my rucksack aiming for majors
Nationwide til were just jack soon as I get the bus back
Clean cut kid without a razor for the mustache
I hit back when the pen hurts me
Im still a choir boy in a French church tee
Im still the same as a year ago
But more people hear me though
According to the myspace and youtube videos
Im always doing shows if Im not Im in the studio
Truly broke never growing up call me Ruffio
Melody music maker
Reading all the papers
They say Im up and coming like Im fucking in an elevator
Cause you need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you at all
You need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you at all
You need me man I dont need youSo so you think you can tell
Heaven from Hell
Blue skys from pain
Can you tell a green field
From a cold steel rail
A smile from a veil
Do you think you can tell
And did they get you to trade
Your heroes for ghosts
Hot ashes for trees
Hot air for a cool breeze
Cold comfort for change
And did you exchange
A walk on part in the war
For a lead role in a cage
How I wish how I wish you were here
Were just two lost souls
Swimming in a fish bowl
Year after year
Running over the same old ground
What have we found
The same old fears
Wish you were hereOf all the money that eer I had
Ive spent it in good company
And all the harm that eer Ive done
Alas it was to none but me
And all Ive done for want of wit
To memory now I cant recall
So fill to me the parting glass
Good night and joy be with you all
Of all the comrades that eer I had
They are sorry for my going away
And all the sweethearts that eer I had
They would wish me one more day to stay
But since it falls unto my lot
That I should rise and you should not
Ill gently rise and Ill softly call
Good night and joy be with you all
A man may drink and not be drunk
A man may fight and not be slain
A man may court a pretty girl and perhaps be welcomed back again
But since it has so ought to be
By a time to rise and a time to fall
Come fill to me the parting glass
Good night and joy be with you all
Good night and joy be with you allYou look so wonderful in your dress
I love your hair like that
The way it falls on the side of your neck
Down your shoulders and back
We are surrounded by all of these lies
And people who talk too much
Youve got that kind of look in your eyes
As if no one knows anything but us
And should this be the last thing I see
I want you to know its enough for me
Cause all that you are is all that Ill ever need
Im so in love so in love
So in love so in love
You look so beautiful in this light
Your silhouette over me
The way it brings out the blue in your eyes
Is the Tenerife sea
And all of the voices surrounding us here
They just fade out when you take a breath
Just say the word and I will disappear
Into the wilderness
And should this be the last thing I see
I want you to know its enough for me
Cause all that you are is all that Ill ever need
Im so in love so in love
So in love so in love
Lumiere darling
Lumiere over me
Lumiere darling
Lumiere over me
Lumiere darling
Lumiere over me
And should this be the last thing I see
I want you to know its enough for me
Cause all that you are is all that Ill ever need
Im so in love so in love
So in love love love love
So in love
You look so wonderful in your dress
I loved your hair like that
And in the moment I knew you BethI keep my hopes and dreams inside of you amongst the other things my mother seems to never see the bruises that Im covering
Never been known by my government name my foster home is where Ive been placed away from the pain
So as you sit before me with a folder holding my story youre my savior with nothing on me but power and glory
And surely youll never ignore cos when the the court came the court date was made to disappear for me
You think you understand me but never what I went through but you were never meant to I wont hold it against you
I take a ballpoint pen to play dot to dot with the cigarette burns etched in my forearms
Forget me not never let me stop youll just sit and watch its your job to be patient so youll let me off
So come with me take a walk on the wild side see life in a day through a childs eyes
And these dreams are all I have to hold me
When sleeps the only thing that I want to take me away away
Okay sessions over time to get back to the classroom I hate this lesson and I guess the teacher finds it hard to
You told me I should try my best but guess what I still find this trigonometry a head fuck
Constantly told I wont pass my GCSEs
Ill end up in Mac Ds serving burgers and cheese
But you told me I can do anything if I put my mind to it
Mistakes make a change if you put a line through em
Lately classmates think Im crazy turn up daily resembling bill bailey
And I aint saying that I cant be groomed with it without new clothes or shower it hard to do
So after school youll take me shopping for some new clothes but theyll get taken off me when I get back to the group home
So come with me take a walk on the wild side see life in a day through a childs eyes
And these dreams are all I have to hold me
When sleeps the only thing that I want to take me away awayCant get you off my mind
Look at me and you will find
Time after time it seems
Ill say what I dont mean
In your world we were the same
In mine now youre the one to blame
You cant remember my name
Were lost its such a shame
Listen to me
Stop making me see
What Ive been waiting for
Listen to me
Stop making me see
Im strong yet proud
Im quiet yet loud
And Im everything
You want in me
Im small yet tall
I have it all
And Im everything
You want me to be
Listen to me
Stop making me see
What Ive been waiting for
Listen to me
Stop making me see
And I still feel like
I need you still
And I still feel like
Im on some pill
And I still feel like
I need you still
Listen to me
Stop making me see
What Ive been waiting for
Listen to me
Making me seeCould I wake up next to you when were hitting double figures
Look into your eyes like Im looking into double mirrors
Could you make it any clearer Everythings such a blur
Its not my turn its hers to get hurt
On a late night coming home from way too many train rides
Lace not as red as my face Im home at the same time
Highbury estates fine
Smoking like a dragon but dont chase lines
I havent slept for the past week
Two hours aint enough for me
I feel inspired at quarter to three am
I havent changed since our last meet
Im still getting all my meals for free
Think Im being shunned by my feet again
Its not a homeless life for me
Its just Im home less than Id like to be
And now Im sitting on a night bus flicking through my Ipod
Feeling kinda tired so I try to close my eyes up
Driver turn the lights off lights on on stage mics on
Song plays nice one gotta keep my hype strong
Truth be never went to Uni
People see right through me but Im not a fool see
Im never gonna do one gonna live past twenty-two done
Everything I need to except get a twenty-one
I havent slept for the past week
Two hours aint enough for me
I feel inspired at quarter to three am
I havent changed since our last meet
Im still getting all my meals for free
Think Im being shunned by my feet again
Its not a homeless life for me
Its just Im home less than Id like to be
When I feel cold you keep me warm
And Im not looking for some loose change
Just wanna find a true mate
Who wants to be my duvet
Its not a homeless life for me
Its just Im home less than Id like to beI fell in love next to you
Burning fires in this room
It just fits light and smooth
Like my feet in my shoes
Little one lie with me
Sew you heart to my sleeve
Well stay quiet underneath
Shooting stars if it helps you sleep
And hold me tight dont let me breathe
Feeling like you wont believe
Theres a firefly loose tonight
Better catch it before it burns this place down
And I lie if I dont feel so right
But the world looks better through your eyes
Theres a firefly loose tonight
Better catch it before it burns this place down
And I lie if I dont feel so right
But the world looks better through your eyes
Teach my skin those new tricks
Warm me up with your lips
Heart to heart melt me down
Its too cold in this town
Close your eyes lean on me
Face to mouth lips to cheek
Feeling numb in my feet
Youre the one
To help me get to sleep
And hold me tight dont let me breathe
Feeling like you wont believe
Theres a firefly loose tonight
Better catch it before it burns this place down
And I lie if I dont feel so right
But the world looks better through your eyes
Theres a firefly loose tonight
Better catch it before it burns this place down
And I lie if I dont feel so right
But the world looks better through your eyes
Its only been one night of love
And maybe that is not enough
Hold me tight dont let me breathe
Feeling like you wont believe
Its only been one night of love
And maybe that is not enough
Hold me tight dont let me breathe
Feeling like you wont believe
Theres a firefly loose tonight
Better catch it before it burns this place down
And I lie if I dont feel so right
But the world looks better through your eyes
Theres a firefly loose tonight
Better catch it before it burns this place down
And I lie if I dont feel so right
But the world looks better through your eyesFilled up with doubt
I have to move home
But I want to stay with you
For all of the summer
I have my plan
That you wont remember
If you want to see the world
Then please ask your mother
I cannot hold your hand
To watch you go
I am a liar
As you might know
I need you now
I need your touch
And your lips
I need that smile
And your kiss
Youre so cool
Youre so beautiful
Youre so
Youre so
Youre so cool
Youre so beautiful
Youre so
Youre so
I see your grace
From my window
When it is late at night
Itll show me your shadow
Im in my place
Hope you remember
When summers gone
Ill still sing a song
Of you in September
I cannot hold your hand
To watch you go
I am a liar
As you might know
I need you now
I need your touch
And your lips
I need that smile
And your kiss
Youre so cool
Youre so beautiful
Youre so
Youre so
Youre so cool
Youre so beautiful
Youre so
Youre so
These words I say mean
Youre so amazing
And Ive noticed lately
I need you maybe
These words I say mean
Youre so amazing
And Ive noticed lately
I need you maybe
Cause youre so cool
Youre so beautiful
Youre so
Youre soI am a poor wayfaring stranger
Traveling through this world alone
And theres no sickness toil or danger
In that bright land to which I go
And Im going there to see my mother
And Im going there no more to roam
And Im only going over Jordan
And Im only going over home now
Extra voice addition
Hey - ey - ey Yeah 
And I know dark clouds will gather round me
And I know my way is rough and steep
And the beautiful fields lie just beyond me
And I know my needs are rough and steep
And Im going there to see my mother
And Im going there no more to roam
And Im only going over Jordan
And Im only going over home now
Cause I am a poor wayfaring stranger
Traveling through this world alone
And theres no sickness toil or danger
In that bright light to which I go
And Im going there to see my mother
And Im going there no more to roam
And Im only going over Jordan
And Im only going over home nowFor fucks sake
Living the life of a student
Yeah I begin on a high
Losing my mind
And they say that Ive been winning for time
Never been to a gun fight never needed a knife
But then I make the cut whenever delivering the lines
Sit on the side with a rhyme pad
With a tin in my sights
Sipping a lemon and lime Corona only with my best friends
Cause I paid in my pride
Giving the time to write rhymes
But I find truth at a quarter to five eh
Its kinda like I took a train
To the left side of my brain oh mayne
Toddle some mud under my door
You know Im stepping in my own lane
All of these speakers sitting behind me
But what psychology psychologically insane
Part of me wanna get down down down
Making you go low inside
You dont know if you dont know by now
You better tell him bout it
What you gonna tell him bout it
Yeah yeah
Ten toes to the dirt
Pencil to the paper
God has a favor for your thirst
Drink-drink ya pint bye-bye
To this bullshit praise Allah
To the wheels Im a ridah
Steering your Prada
Only closed in my Ada-di-das
Im a fetus in my boom sake nana
Daddys home on the mic hey papa
Back with my bang yo straight loop on my pedal no band though
But every single one of my fans know that
Every damn show Im taking their ears on a journey
Like Im flying overseas with Van Gogh
Livin so sweet without Gretel and Hansel
Critics hate the lyrics cause they think Ive been tangoed
Find me wearing old clothes rocking a Kangol
Im riding round with Yelawolf in your daddys Lambo
Hello me how ya been
You got a mullet again like when you was ten
Youre probably sipping sweet tees you still huh
And your piggy bank is full of change
Fact what you used to steal from
You been playing fools like a steel drum
Pulling out early and they still come
Eating from the game when you know the meals done
Yelawolf is kicking back at these pilgrims
Hold up baby sit still son
Whoa this old rock it heals been rolled
Still shocking when I see em go
Bananas and they hammer the
Living the life of a student
Yeah I begin on a high
Losing my mind
And they say that Ive been winning for time
Never been to a gun fight never needed a knife
But then I make the cut whenever delivering the lines
Sit on the side with a rhyme pad
With a tin in my sights
Sipping a lemon and lime Corona only with my best friends
Cause I paid in my pride
Giving the time to write rhymes
But I find truth at a quarter to five eh
Im not the average half wit
After this hour gets out of this
sixty seconds Im going in any directions
And chasing this jack with a shot of Budweiser and water
Its probably the better idea you move the direction in
Fact its a part of me to be the looser of cannons
Blowing his fucking mics like the winds
I caught this cardigan
Hooligans hooligans hooligans
But really whos a friend
Jump in this little fire jump right back in the pool again
Know I be new again
A student of you my friend
Marshall Mathers Im tossing rappers up at my crew of ten
Minus four minus war
You dont want it
Shady records Im already better fuck it doggonnit
Dog dont gotta lead
Dogs already home
Jack dog Im a beast Im a wolf
Bring your dogs back
A melody man in a melancholic mellow yellow can
Sh tell him how we gonna sell em man
Been working hard all week
So if you wonder if we earned it well its not a probably
So wont you bring that back to me
And holla when you hear it like all the screams of a Halloween
I got blisters on my feet
To walk in night with you is not the shoes to be borrowing
So wont you bring that back to me
Cause all the sole of my pin is what all the sorrow brings
If you dont know if you dont know no no no
If you dont know if you dont know no no no
If you dont know if you dont know no no no
If you dont know if you dont know no no noWill you recognise me in the flashing lights
I try to keep my heart beat but I cant get it right
Will you recognise me when Im laying on my back
Somethings gone inside me and it aint coming back now
Oh heaven oh heaven I wait with good intention now
But the day it always lasts too long mm then Im gone
Oh heaven oh heaven I wait with good intention now
But the day it always lasts too long woah
Then Im gone  woo woo woo wooo
Will you recognise me when Im stealing from the poor
Youre not gonna like me no Im nothing like before wow
And will you recognise me when I lose another friend
Will you learn to leave me or give me one more try again
Oh heaven oh heaven I wait with good intention now
But the day it always lasts too long woah then Im gone
Oh heaven oh heaven I wait with good intention now
But the day it always lasts too long now
Then Im gone  now woo woo woo wooo
Baby be mine now mm mm mmm
Oh heaven oh heaven I wait with good intention now
But the day it always lasts too long mm then Im gone
Oh heaven oh heaven I wait with good intention now
But the day it always lasts too long wow

If you snitchin I go loco
Hit you with that treinta ocho
Niggas thinkin that Im solo
fifty deep theyre like oh no
Heard the feds takin photos
I know nothin fuck the popo
Im in love with the coco
I got it for the low low
thirty-six thats a kilo
Need a brick miss my free throw
Im in love just like Ne-Yo
Bustin shots now he Neo
Free my homies fuck the CO
Fuck the judge fuck my PO
All this coke like Im Nino
Water whip Im like Nemo
Bakin soda I got bakin soda
Bakin soda I got bakin soda
Whip it through the glass nigga
Im blowin money fast nigga
Im in love with the coco
I got it for the low lowI wanna be drunk when I wake up
On the right side of the wrong bed
And every excuse I made up
Tell you the truth I hate
What didnt kill me
It never made me stronger at all
Love will scar your make-up lip sticks to me
So now Ill maybe leave back there
Im sat here wishing I was sober
I know Ill never hold you like I used to
But our house gets cold when you cut the heating
Without you to hold Ill be freezing
Cant rely on my heart to beat it
Cause you take part of it every evening
Take words out of my mouth just from breathing
Replace with phrases like when youre leaving me
Should I should I
Maybe Ill get drunk again
Ill be drunk again
Ill be drunk again
To feel a little love
I wanna hold your heart in both hands
Ill watch it fizzle at the bottom of a Coke can
And Ive got no plans for the weekend
So shall we speak then
Keep it between friends
Though I know youll never love me like you used to
There maybe other people like us
You see the flicker of the clip when they light up
Flames just create us burns dont heal like before
You dont hold me anymore
On cold days Coldplays out like the bands the name
I know I cant heal things with a hand shake
You know I cant change as I began saying
You cut me wide open like landscape
Open bottles of beer but never champagne
To applaud you with the sound that my hands make
Should I should I
Maybe Ill get drunk again
Ill be drunk again
Ill be drunk again
To feel a little love
All by myself
Im here again
All by myself
You know Ill never change
All by myself
All by myself
Im just drunk again
Ill be drunk again
Ill be drunk again
To feel a little loveI found your hairband on my bedroom floor
The only evidence that youve been here before
And I dont get waves of missing you anymore
Theyre more like tsunami tides in my eyes
Never getting dry so I get high smoke in the day then I sleep with the light on
Weeks pass in the blink of an eye
And Im still drunk by the end of the night
I dont drink like everybody else
End up forgetting things about myself
Im stubborn Im forward heads just blocked
My heads still with you but my hearts just not
So am I close to you anymore if its over
And theres no chance that well work it out
Thats why you and I ended over U-N-I
And I said thats fine but youre the only one that knows I lied
You and I ended over U-N-I
And I said thats fine but youre the only one that knows I lied
Everybody said that well be together forever but I know that
I never wanna settle down come around break up the love like Lego now
Never wanna turn into another like you
Sleep with my thoughts dance with my views
Everythings great but everythings short
But you live in your halls and I live in a tour bus
Now Im in position to be another stalker
And every thing I say seems to always sound awkward
Like our last kiss it was perfect but we were nervous
On the surface
And Im always saying everyday that it was worth it
Pain is only relevant if it still hurts
I forget like an elephant or we can use a sedative
And go back to the day we fell in love on first kiss
So am I close to you anymore if its over
And theres no chance that well work it out
Oh you and I ended over U-N-I
And I said thats fine but youre the only one that knows I lied
You and I ended over U-N-I
And I said thats fine but youre the only one that knows I lied
Because if I was gonna go somewhere Id be there by now
And maybe I can let myself down oh
And thinking I am unaware I keep my feet on the ground
Keep looking around to make sure Im not he only one to feel low
Because if you want Ill take you in my arms
And keep you sheltered from all that Ive done wrong
And I know youll say that Im the only one
But I know that god made another one of me
To love you better than I ever will
Cause you and I ended over U-N-I
And I said thats fine but youre the only one that knows I lied
You and I ended over U-N-I
And I said thats fine but youre the only one that knows I liedUnhappy days
That left us on the floor
And you breathe me
Till youre not feeling sure
Everything will brighten up
If we go to Brighton
Ill take you along the Pier
Everything will lighten up
If you feel too frightened
Ill make it disappear dear
Darling dont be nervous
Ill understand
If youll let me go
I did this on purpose
Now when Im missing you
Ill stop eating food
And Ill squeeze into a dress
So I can be like you
And then Ill see your bitterness
And why youre leaving too
Maybe Ill put you to a test
And say that I love you
I think that I love you
Sunny days
That left my skin dark red
You squeeze me
Till these thoughts leave my head
If it gets too complicated
Ill give up and be frustrated
Can you see whats wrong
If you feel like youve been hated
This loves too overrated
See whats going on on
Darling dont be nervous
Ill understand
If youll let me go
I did this on purpose
Now when Im missing you
Ill stop eating food
And Ill squeeze into a dress
So I can be like you
And then Ill see your bitterness
And why youre leaving too
Maybe Ill put you to a test
And say that I love you
I think that I love you
Take me back to live at home
Take me back to Albert Road
Now Im missing you
Ive stopped eating food
And Ive squeezed into your dress
So I can feel like you
But then I saw your bitterness
And why you left me too
I thought Id put you to a test
And say that I love you
I think that I love you
And I stopped eating food
And I squeezed into your dress
So I could feel like you
But then I saw your bitterness
And why you left me too
Maybe Ill put you to a test
And say that I love you
Now it seems you loved me tooListen Little Lady this is just the worst way to spend your birthday
Its thirty degrees Thursday you work late
You was with a perv making dirty fake love in his Mercedes
Maybe the word rape sums up events that take place every night
You wanna get up but you know your legs will ache if you tryHey
Can you hear me
I just wanted to let you know
Hm
I hope you can hear what I write to you
How could I say goodbye to you
When Im a life that came out of the inside of a life that was inside of you
I gotta respect the way you provided food for the whole fam
You came over a moon rush supporting a mar jays old man
Cold double eight eight kids bare wheels
Plus racists full of hatred in your own plant
three jobs in a day
Rest in life in you working but you were never stress free
Just locked in a cage slaving
They said they were gold in the pavements
But you came and saw the road to amazement
Broke your heart
But still you were prone to last and your sorrow was over fast
I hope your listening right
I still think of you every Sunday
No one can top your chicken and rice
Even through the darkness times
You held us all up because your vision was bright
I knew your strength was your wisdom inside
You never let anyone see your heartache
You just got on with it
Anyone tells me that they knew you said you were beautiful
And your words you would stand strong with it
Cause they were like warmth on a winter night
But I was just too young to go on with it
And there somethings I could try to do
But its an impossible task for me to even try to say goodbye to you
I couldnt do that I owe my life to you
And of the pieces of my soul
Because I need a sign I hope this pain will heal in time
You know I never want to be alone
I can see the stars as a cold wind greets the air
And will you think of me up there
Can I say goodbye to you
And paint the stains of the teardrops down my face
Or feel the chill of your warm embrace
Can I say goodbye to you oh
I think you phoney
I was younger with the knowledge of things that I know now
I would be by your side when you needed me
Instead of asking you Nan can I go out
Standing in a road with the gangs that I know now
Everyones missing you loads Jessicas grown up
Warreen Lauren and Alex are fine and Im living with hope
Its been a while since Ive seen C and the mouths
I miss seeing a family being a family
And us agreeing with smiles how it used to be as a child
But as time goes by the bridge seems longer
Family problems have never been funny
In my heart the only one that dissed me was Sonia
She took all our inheritance money
Left the rest of us to pick up the pieces
I never forgive the way she betrayed us
There aint a big enough reason
Before I sell out my fam Ill be giving up breathing
But I guess that everyones different
Or should I say no ones perfect
She had happiness in front of her
But chose to ride the wave that no ones surfing
Since you gone the foundations crumbled
So building it back up is my next step
I got all the bricks and the cement but
Its hard when its done I dont know what to expect
So give me the strength that I need to perform this task
Make it right I must do
And I ask cause I trust you
It goes way beyond a song when I say I love you
And of the pieces of my soul
Because I need a sign I hope this pain will heal in time
You know I never wanna be alone
I can see the stars as a cold the wind greets the air
And will you think of me up there
Can I say goodbye to you
And paint the stains of the teardrops down my face
Or feel the chill of your warm embrace
Can I say goodbye to you oh
Its just for now so I should hush
Ill never get enough Ill see you when I see you but
I miss you
Ohh how I miss you
Its just for now so I should hush
Ill never get enough Ill see you when I see you but
I miss you
Ohh how I miss you
There aint enough words to describe
How sorry I am for the pain that I caused
Sorry for when I stuck up my own blood
We were young and he said it was raping his broad
And for the day police came to the door
Im sorry for being such a bad youth
Stealing from your purse and making you mourn
I never been able to say this before
Cause I was so inconsiderate
You loved me unconditionally
And I took advantage of it like a idiot
Not seeing the pure soul that I was living with
I really hope that you can forgive me
You going away was a punishment
But I wont let go Im holding you with me
But I still fight the emotions within me
I can see the stars as the cold wind greets the air
And will you think of me up there
And can I say goodbye to you
And paint the stains of the teardrops down your face
Feel the chill of your warm embrace
And can I say goodbye to you
I can see the stars as a cold wind greets the air
And will you think of me up there
Can I say goodbye to you
And paint the stains of the teardrops down my face
Or feel the chill of your warm embrace
Can I say goodbye to youAnother day another life
Passes by just like mine
Its not complicated
Another mind
Another soul
Another body to grow old
Its not complicated
Do you ever wonder if the stars shine out for you
Float down
Like autumn leaves
Hush now
Close your eyes before the sleep
And youre miles away
And yesterday you were here with me
Another tear
Another cry
Another place for us to die
Its not complicated
Another love thats gone to waste
Another light lost from your face
Its complicated
Is it that its over or do birds still sing for you
Float down
Like autumn leaves
Hush now
Close your eyes before the sleep
And youre miles away
And yesterday you were here with me
Ooh how I miss you
My symphony played the song that carried you out
Ooh how I miss you
And I I miss you and I wish youd stay
Do you ever wonder if the stars shine out for you
Float down
Like autumn leaves
Hush now
Close your eyes before the sleep
And youre miles away
And yesterday you were here with me
Touch down
Like a seven four seven
Or stay out and well live forever nowSettle down with me
Cover me up
Cuddle me in
Lie down with me
And hold me in your arms
And your hearts against my chest your lips pressed in my neck
Im falling for your eyes but they dont know me yet
And with a feeling Ill forget Im in love now
Kiss me like you wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
This feels like falling in love
Falling in love
Were falling in love
Settle down with me
And Ill be your safety
Youll be my lady
I was made to keep your body warm
But Im cold as the wind blows so hold me in your arms
Oh no
My hearts against your chest your lips pressed in my neck
Im falling for your eyes but they dont know me yet
And with this feeling Ill forget Im in love now
Kiss me like you wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
This feels like falling in love
Falling in love
Were falling in love
Yeah Ive been feeling everything
From hate to love
From love to lust
From lust to truth
I guess thats how I know you
So I hold you close to help you give it up
So kiss me like you wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
This feels like falling in love
Falling in love
Were falling in love
Kiss me like you wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
This feels like falling in love
Falling in love
Were falling in loveThe rain wont stop falling
Its harder than before
This car keeps on stalling
Pedal to the floor
What I need to know
Is if you love me and I
Really need to know
Is if you want me when you call
If you want me when you call
We were young and we were foolish
School books in our arms
Dodging homework dodging classes
To set off fire alarms
And what I need to know
Is if you love me and I
Really need to know
If you need me when you call
If you want me when you call
We are waving our lives away
We are waving our lives away
We are waving our lives away
We are waving our lives away
We are waving and what I need to know
We are waving is if you love me and I
We are waving really need to know
We are waving if you need me when you call
We are waving what I need to know
We are waving is if you love me an I
We are waving really need to know
We are waving if you need me when you call
What I need to know
Is if you love me and I
Really need to know
If you need me when you call
If you want me when you callShock horror im down
Lost youre not around
Theres a lump in my chest that
Sends cold through my head and
My mind shuts sound out
Im on autopilot
And my tongues gone silent
Just switch it off and lay it down
Lay it down next to me
I dont know when I lost my mind
Maybe when I made you mine
Wooooohhh ohhhhh
I dont know when I lost my mind
Maybe it was every time
That you said you said you saaaaaid
That I miss you
That I miss you
These words mean nothing to me
Im just sittin on a fence of how it used to be
These three words are aching
Constrict and suffocating
My mind is racing
With the picture im painting
And my bellys sick to its stomach
When I remember all the times it was with you
When you laid it dowwwn
When you laid down next to me
I dont know when I lost my mind
Maybe when I made you mine
Wooooohhh ohhhhh
I dont know when I lost my mind
Maybe it was every time
That you said you said you saaaaaid
That I miss you more than I let on
I kissed you far too long
Ill let go soon as you do
See I know were not through
I dont know when I lost my mind
maybe when I made you mine
Wooooooah ohhhhhh
I dont know when I lost my mind
Maybe it was every time
That you said you said you saaaaid
That I miss you
That I miss you
Wooooaahhh
I dont know when I lost my mind
Maybe it was every time
That you said you said you saaaaaaid
That I miss youIm gonna pick up the pieces
And build a Lego house
If things go wrong we can knock it down
My three words have two meanings
Theres one thing on my mind
Its all for you
And its dark in a cold December but Ive got you to keep me warm
If youre broken I will mend you and Ill keep you sheltered from the storm thats raging on now
Im out of touch Im out of luck
Ill pick you up when youre getting down
And out of all these things Ive done I think I love you better now
Im out of sight Im out of mind
Ill do it all for you in time
And out of all these things Ive done I think I love you better now
Im gonna paint you by numbers
And color you in
If things go right we can frame it and put you on a wall
And its so hard to say it but Ive been there before
Now Ill surrender up my heart
And swap it for yours
Im out of touch Im out of love
Ill pick you up when youre getting down
And out of all these things Ive done I think I love you better now
Im out of sight Im out of mind
Ill do it all for you in time
And out of all these things Ive done I think I love you better
Dont hold me down
I think my braces are breaking and its more than I can take
And its dark in a cold December but Ive got you to keep me warm
If youre broken I will mend you and Ill keep you sheltered from the storm thats raging on now
Im out of touch Im out of love
Ill pick you up when youre getting down
And out of all these things Ive done I think I love you better now
Im out of sight Im out of mind
Ill do it all for you in time
And out of all these things Ive done I think I love you better now
Im out of touch Im out of luck
Ill pick you up when youre getting down
And out of all these things Ive done I think I love you better now
Im out of sight Im out of mind
Ill do it all for you in time
And out of all these things Ive done I think I love you better now
Im out of touch Im out of luck
Ill pick you up when youre getting down
And out of all these things Ive done I will love you better nowHmm let me go
To see my family
Please Father let me go
As my mother sleeps
I dont know about days gone
But round here nobody lives twice
When your gone your gone without no bye
Cause only a judge can give you life
This is my advice
Trust me I nearly lost my life
three weeks after I got this ride
It seems like I had too much wine
Which that I I didnt get one
Anyway I was going to the booked for a set
Even though I didnt have a set one
Skream hit the decks I was like check one
Put on a show but it werent my best one
Left it dropped off Blacks at his destination
Then I was off to the next one
twenty minutes later I was on the Mone
Tired
But I kept on going
Fell asleep without even knowing
No emotion in my face
No movement in my legs but the car still kept going
Woke up
Lorry
Flash
Panic
Break
Skid
Crash
Skidded
More
Bang
Smash
Out
Cold
Ribs
Cracked
Ouch
I was in so much pain
Crawled out of a Megane that now looked like a Mini
When I was still on the first lane
Baffled didnt even know my name
Fainted too much shock in my brain
Surrounded by paramedics and feds
Trying to get up but fainted again
See I just want you to take a second hear me out
Dont think Im happy cause I smile when you see me out
Ive had serious madnesses where Ive nearly disappeared
Oh Im begging Lord to save me and let me go
To see my family
And keep it inside
Dry eyes while my brother weeps
Save my soul
Please Father let me go
Keep me safe as my mother sleeps
Eyes closed they just wouldnt open
I can hear voices and my phone ringing
Fighting for life cant tell if Im winning
One of the worst situations Ive been in
I can hear all of the angels singing
But when it stopped humming
My brain turned on stared running
Still in pain but it started numbing
The stone cold comeback I made was stunning
I still tried to do a few shows cause I didnt wanna tell them that I werent coming
But I was left with a permanent problem
Nobody knows about the pain that Im in inside
Ever so cunning
six weeks later jogging and running
I used the first aid kit like a drum set
Picked up the tools and I gave it a drumming
Trust me when it comes to mistakes
You cant afford to let one in
Never done dream for a while
The pipeline was blocked
So I learnt and done a bit of plumbing
They say tomorrow never dies
But he forgot to tell you you can
You can have a sicker clan than Wu-Tang
But when your times up thats it its you fam
You can try beg for another
Sometimes Ill be on my way to a show
Thinking I just wanna see my brother
Then do a U-turn Im gone Runner
I just want you to take a second hear me out
Dont think Im happy cause I smile when you see me out
Ive had serious madnesses where Ive nearly disappeared
Oh Im begging Lord to save me and let me go
To see my family
And keep it inside
Dry eyes while my brother weeps
Save my soul
Please Father let me go
Keep me safeYou give me life
Like lots of oxygen
You treat me like
I was in love again
And I hold you tight
Tight enough to know
That you are mine
Id never let you go
And its you I miss
And its you I miss
So let it out
And let it out now
And let it out
And let it out now now
And you speak to me
Behind your dark green stare
And you let me be
As if I wasnt there
It seemed perfect
The concept
Free from any regret
Another couple based on teen sex
You idiot true I was just like you
We couldnt be torn apart
You see we were just like glue
Its you I miss
And its you I miss
So let it out
And let it out now
And let it out
And let it out now now
It seemed perfect
The concept
Free from any regret
Another couple based on teen sex
You idiot true I was just like you
We couldnt be torn part
You see we were just like glue
Were like glue
So let it out
Let it out now
Let it out
And let it out now now
It seemed perfect
The concept

Another couple based on teen sex
You idiot true I was just like you
We couldnt be torn apart
You see we were just like glueYou were just a small bump unborn in four months youre brought to life
You might be left with my hair but youll have your mothers eyes
Ill hold your body in my hands be as gentle as I can
And now your scan on my unmade plans
Small bump in four months youre brought to life
Ill hold you tightly Ill give you nothing but truth
If youre not inside me Ill put my future in you
You are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers round my thumb and hold me tight
Oh you are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers round my thumb and hold me tight
And youll be alright
Youre just a small bump unknown and youll grow into your skin
With a smile like hers and a dimple beneath your chin
Oh Finger nails the size of a half grain of rice
And eyelids closed to be soon opened wide a small bump
In four months youll open your eyes
Ill hold you tightly Ill give you nothing but truth
If youre not inside me Ill put my future in you
You are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers round my thumb and hold me tight
Oh you are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers round my thumb and hold me tight
And youll be alright
You can lie with me with your tiny feet when your half asleep
Ill leave you be
Right in front of me for a couple weeks
So I can keep you safe
Cause you are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers round my thumb and hold me tight
Oh you are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers round my thumb and hold me tight
And youll be alright
You were just a small bump unborn for four months then torn from life
Maybe you were needed up there but were still unaware as whyGive me love like her
Cause lately Ive been waking up alone
Paint splattered teardrops on my shirt
Told you Id let them go
And that Ill fight my corner
Maybe tonight Ill call ya
After my blood turns into alcohol
No I just wanna hold ya
Give a little time to me or burn this out
Well play hide and seek to turn this around

After my blood is drowning in alcohol
No I just wanna hold ya
Give a little time to me or burn this out
Well play hide and seek to turn this around
All I want is the taste that your lips allow

Of all the money that eer I had
Ive spent it in good company
And all the harm that eer Ive done
Alas it was to none but me
And all Ive done for want of width
To memory now I cant recall
So fill to me the parting glass
Good night and joy be with you all
Of all the comrades that ever I had
They are sorry for my going away
And all the sweethearts that ever I had
They would wish me one more day to stay
But since it falls unto my lot
That I should rise and you should not
Ill gently rise and Ill softly call
Good night and joy be with you all
A man may drink and not be drunk
A man may fight and not be slain
A man may court a pretty girl
And perhaps be welcomed back again
But since it has so ought to be
By a time to rise and a time to fall
Come fill to me the parting glass
Good night and joy be with you all
Good night and joy be with you allSmoke alarm went off at night
I woke up wiped the sleep out of my eye
She left a note Ill be back in five
Well Im still waiting for that moment to arrive
Hey
I was told to put my job in front of you
But it wont hold me like you do
But I do it for the love
Waiting on the gold rush
Keep it on the edge
Smoking on a roll up
When I see my friends all they say is hold up
And remember the time
When we were in school listening to grown ups
Didnt learn a thing but then again you know what
You know how to sing
But you dont know anything other than that
So maybe you should learn to love her like like the way
And maybe you should learn to love her like like the way
And maybe you should learn to love her like like the way
And maybe you should learn to love her like like the way
You wanna be loved
I never told her that I liked
The way she dances slightly out of time
And pretends she knows the words to a song shes never heard
But I tell her all the time
Hey
Well I was told to put my job in front of you
But it wont hold me like you do
But I do it for the love waiting on the gold rush
Keep it on the edge smoking on a roll up
When I see my friends all they say is hold up
And remember the time
When we were in school listening to grown ups
Didnt learn a thing but then again you know what
You know how to sing
But you dont know anything other than that
So maybe you should learn to love her like like the way
And maybe you should learn to love her like like the way
But maybe you should learn to love her like like the way
And maybe you should learn to love her like like the way
You wanna be loved hey
I do it for the love waiting on the gold rush
Keep it on the edge smoking on a roll up
When I see my friends all they say is hold up
And remember the time
When we were in school listening to grown ups
Didnt learn a thing but then again you know what
You know how to sing
But you dont know anything other than that
So maybe you should learn to love her like like the way
And maybe you should learn to love her like like the way
And maybe you should learn to love her like like the way
But maybe you should learn to love her like like the way
You wanna be lovedNow Im in town break it down thinking of making a new sound
Playing a different show
every night in front of a new crowd
Thats new now ciao seems that life is great now
See me lose focus as I sing to you loud
And I cant no I wont hush
Ill say the words that make you blush
Im gonna sing this now ow ow
See Im true my songs are where my heart is
Im like glue I stick to other artists
Im not you now that would be disastrous
Let me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures
See Im real I do it all its all me
Im not fake dont ever call me lazy
I wont stay put give me the chance to be free
Suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me
Cause you need me but I dont need you
You need me but I dont need you
You need me but I dont need you at all
You need me but I dont need you
You need me but I dont need you
You need me but I dont need you
You need me but I dont need you at all
You need me
I sing and write my own tune and I write my own verse
Hell dont need another word-smith to make my tune sell
Call yourself a singer-writer youre just bluffing
Your names on the credits and you didnt write nothing
I sing fast I know that all my shits cool
I will blast and I didnt go to Brit School
I came fast with the way I act right
I cant last if Im smoking on a crack pipe
And I wont be a product of my genre
My mind will always be stronger than my songs are
Never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya
Always read the stories that you hear on Wikipedia
And musically Im demonstrating
When I perform live feels like I am meditating
Times at the Enterprise when some fella filmed me
A young singer-writer like a Gabriella Cilmi
Cause you need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you at all
You need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you at all
You need me
Cause with the lyrics Ill be aiming it right
I wont stop till my names in lights
At stadium heights with Damien Rice
On red carpets now Im on Arabian Nights
Because Im young and all my brothers gonna give me advice
Long nighter short height and I gone hyper
Never be anything but a singer-songwriter
The games over but now Im on a new level
Watch how I step on the track without a loop pedal
People think that Im bound to blow up
Ive done around about a thousand shows
But I havent got a house plus I live on the couch
So you can be the lyrics when Im singing them out
Wow
From day one Ive been prepared
With vofive wax for my ginger hair
So now Im back to the sofa giving a dose of what the future holds
Cause its another day
Plus Ill keep my last name forever keep the genre pretty basic
Gonna be breaking into other peoples tunes when I chase it
And replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift
Into another rappers shoes using new laces
Selling CDs from my rucksack aiming for the papers
Selling CDs from my rucksack aiming for the majors
Nationwide tour with just jack still had to get the bus back
Clean cut kid without a razor for the mustache
I hit back when the pen hurts me
Im still a choir boy in a Fenchurch tee
Im still the same as a year ago
But more people hear me though
According to the MySpace and YouTube videos
Im always doing shows if Im not Im in the studio
Truly broke never growing up call me Ruffio
Melody music maker
Reading all the papers
They say Im up and coming like Im fucking in an elevator
Cause you need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you at all
You need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you at all
You need me man I dont need youThese thoughts I have could be clear ones and they can seem vivid
the goals I reach are not near ones the further than limits
I block her out so when Im looking through my mind she aint in it
Can I be free for a minute can I be me for a minute
The thoughts I have can be dark ones even be smart ones
Know Im gonna have a couple straight from the heart ones
Tell you what I think I will until I depart mum
Its you that I lived for I am the first and the last one to love you lots
Whats better than thinking about the ones you love
Nothing much when youre thinking about the ones you love
I feel the same when Im in the floor see the sun above
Unconditional like bills paid when I run them up
No one here to help you pain now youre gonna moan
No one here to save the day now youre all alone
Wish I was born with a golden spoon in my mouth
Fact is I wasnt so Im coming from a colder zone
And when the sun falls down Ill be up again
I never close my eyes
And if the dawn might break Ill see nothing when nothing when
My thoughts are only you and my mind is over you
My thoughts are over you and these words are all for you all for you
I wanna see you happy I wanna see you smile
Cause youre been trespassing and you wont leave my mind
Now even think about this call me say yes nan
Im thirty-one now Im still saying yes nan
You had to replace my mom dad two parents in one
I know your proud staring at your grandson
I found a job I like like got the flat the cars the bike the quad I
like
Because of you Im tireless in every single song I write
Had a golden life wanting people to honour mine
Tell em while Im here cause one day Im gonna die
And when Im Im gone I want my music still playin
And when my people listen to this track its gonna make them wanna cry
I aint gonna lie I think about my scene to say the games better is a must
now I gotta fly
My talents gonna shine for surely fam I know it I work round the clock
I dont stop at nightThis city never sleeps
I hear the people walk by when its late
Sirens bleed through my windowsill
I cant close my eyes
Cant control what Im into
This tower is alive
The lights that blind keep me awake
With my hood up and lace untied
Sleep fills my mind
Cant control what Im into
London calls me a stranger
A traveler
This is now my home my home
Im burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
Im blazing on the street
What I do isnt up to you
And if the city never sleeps
Then that makes two
The pavement is my friend
And it will take me where I need to go
I find it trips me up
And puts me down
This is not what Im used to
The shop across the road
Fulfills my needs and gives me company
When I need it
Voices speak through my walls
I dont think Im gonna make it
Past tomorrow
London calls me a stranger
A traveler
This is now my home my home
Im burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
Im blazing on the street
What I do isnt up to you
And if the city never sleeps
Then that makes two
And my lungs hurt
And my ears bled
With the sound of the city life
Echoed in my head
Do I need this to keep me alive
The traffic stops and starts
But I need to move along
London calls me a stranger
This is not my home home
Im burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
Im blazing on the street
What I do isnt up to you
And if the city never sleeps
Then that makes twoThey tell me you can only dream when you fell asleep
But now Im working to achieve but sleep is the only thing I never see
And I vowed that my breathing with never cease
To the retrieve then I cant let them be
I wont let em leave and I had the same feeling since seventeen
But I wasnt ready then like a lemon screen
Now Im in the magazines almost every week
Cause Im getting heat like in Tenerife
Right now its better than its never been
Never fade like a plant thats evergreen
So I hope to my heart but my self doubts are getting me
Afraid for my cross getting dump for the day and Im getting weak
Cause Im new Im that boy that starts it
They chase dreams together like a slumber party
And now Im on my own even though Im smooth sailing
Im scared to sing cause my nightmare is fading
Chorus
When the darkness creeps in
I feel my nightmares watching me
And when my dreams are sleeping
I feel my nightmares watching me
Oh oh oh
I feel my nightmares watching me
You better wake up cause I am making moves
And even when Im dozing Im breaking rooms
Im only hitting the sack when Im training
Too busy trying to keep up with the latest snooze
Made my bed and thats where Im heading
I fly straight with the best man I embed em
Married to the game was a quiet wedding then I had to fight to get her
Now Im taking control of my inception
cause they try to hit misses with my direction
See they better marry donna cause when I strike strike
Not even Maradonna is gonna cry Im awake at night
The haters know where the family lives
Tell me what I catch but youre playing knock door ginger
Just gonna lose a lot more than I need it
They say sleep is the cause of death
But I hear shit because I am deaf
Gang signs Im NA reading
Im a CEO man you suckers are next
Chorus
When the darkness creeps in
I feel my nightmares watching me
And when my dreams are sleeping
I feel my nightmares watching me
Oh oh oh
I feel my nightmares watching me
They watching me They watch me sleep
Let me go
I fell asleep on sofa walk up in reality
And daydream about losing my sanity
Ive been rhyming forever got a blind flow
So I can see an off note with my eyes closed
But to achieve the dreams you cant doze off cos your dream a sleep
I aint nodding off but Im nodding to the beat
I be shocking in my sheets when I should have been asleep
See all the dreams Im fonder
You placed me in the team insomnia
Now I Mr hard worker
In my nightmares I Mr cant turn up
And I missed my chance worst luck
Trying to hit women I Mr I turn up
Yeah and I walked from ish
thinking it will put me to rest on my mattress
Chorus
When the darkness creeps in
I feel my nightmares watching me
And when my dreams are sleeping
I feel my nightmares watching me
Oh oh oh
I feel my nightmares watching me
Watching meMy mind is a warrior
My heart is a foreigner
My eyes are the color of red like the sunset
Ill never keep it bottled up
Left to the hands of the coroner
Be a true heart not a follower
Were not done yet now
I see it in your movements tonight
If we can ever do this right
Im never gonna let you down
Oh Ill never let you down
Now keep it on the down low
And Ill keep you around so Ill know
That Ill never let you down
Ill never let you down
Youre strumming on my heart strings
Like you were a grade eight but I never felt this way
Ill pick your feet up off of the ground
And never ever let you down
Youre strumming on my heart strings
Like you were a grade eight but I never felt this way
Ill pick your feet up off of the ground
And never ever let you down
My eyes are a river filler
This drink is a liver killer
My chest is a pillow for my weary head to lay to rest again
Your body is my ballpoint pen
And your mind is my new best friend
Your eyes are my mirror to take me to the edge again
Now I see it in your movements tonight
If we should ever do this right
Im never gonna let you down
Oh Ill never let you down
Well keep it on the down low
And Ill keep you around so Ill know
That Ill never let you down
Ill never let you down
Youre strumming on my heart strings
Like you were a grade eight but I never felt this way
Ill pick your feet up off of the ground
And never ever let you down
Youre strumming on my heart strings
Like you were a grade eight but I never felt this way
Ill pick your feet up off of the ground
And never ever let you down
Hold my heart to stop me bleeding now now now
And Ill never let you down
Hold my heart to stop me bleeding now now now
And Ill never let you down
Hold my heart to stop me bleeding now now now
And Ill never let you down
Hold my heart to stop me bleeding now now now
And Ill never let you down
Youre strumming on my heart strings
Like you were a grade eight but I never felt this way
Ill pick your feet up off of the ground
And never ever let you down
Youre strumming on my heart strings
Like you were a grade eight but I never felt this way
Ill pick your feet up off of the ground
And never ever let you downHi my name is JME there was a time when radio played me
Cause my music came from my heart it was real to me
But now its a par
Im here struggling keeping it real
While the rest of them are hustling seeking a deal
Sometimes I sit back and think JME just do one tune make a couple Gs and chill
The reason I started making music is the exact same reason that Ill never do it I swear
I didnt go through all that for this
Ill give that a miss thats just how it is unfair straight
Who could tell me different look at me determined
Man on a mission my music is me and I am my music
So like it or lump it Im a do this
I never had a playlist in my heart oho
Now I need an A list just to chart oho
But Ive been famous from the start oho
How am I gonna make my mark oho oh
Are you gonna play me though
This song was never meant for the radio
I get in forget the radio spin Im just doing my thing
And I dont have time for a playlist
How much will you pay me though
The song was not a hit on the radio
Oho oho oho oh oh oh
Thank God for night clubs and the raves
Cause I dont think they like us on the airwaves
Unless we water it down but cordial music is boring me now
I swear I guess it matters what your goal is
Or in this music scene what your role is
Im still trying here cause Im a pioneer
I use my mouth less than I use my eyes and ears
See Im just telling you the truth
Cant shoot the messenger bullet proof booth
You wont hear me on the radio
But go to the rave and the crowd theyre raising roof
Why is that Whats going on there
To tell you the truth I dont really care
I am my music my music is me
Like it or not this is how its gonna be
I never had a playlist in my heart oho
Now I need an A list just to chart oho
But Ive been famous from the start oho
How am I gonna make my mark oho
Are you gonna play me though
This song was never meant for the radio
I get in forget the radio spin Im just doing my thing
And I dont have time for a playlist
How much will you pay me though
The song was not a hit on the radio
Oho oho oho oh oho ohHush little baby dont you cry
I said hush little baby dont you cry
I said hush little baby dont you cry no
I said hush little baby dont you cry
Im saying hush little baby dont you cry
Daddy aint sure if he can raise you right
I aint even good with saving my money
Why should I think I can save your life
And the whole familys gonna think Im a devil I dont wanna see my angels eyes
I say this with one hand on my heart guilt aint gonna make me change my mind
My first thoughts were the worst thoughts running round my head in circles
The worlds gonna hate me for saying this but patience is a virtue
So we dont have to rush for our first youth we can take time do rehearsals
And I aint acting this is personal and I aint doing this just to hurt you
I should say goodbye before I say hello
So darling hold me closely tonight
Because if you open your eyes Ill never let you go
Moving slowly well both sleep tonight
And well just be dreaming til you wake me up
When Im telling her about raving
Shes telling me about cravings
I want her to just get the message
I dont wanna have to be so blatant
So I told her my life aint balanced
Yeah said the time aint right
She said gods clocks the only one that matters
And its about time I tried yeah and if I listen to my family
Then theyll be a new addition to my family
I cant help feeling peer pressured everybodys looking down but they dont understand me
And everyones so suggestive Im getting mixed messages but nobodys rang me
Huh Im saying this aint a game but I say the wrong thing and everyone wants to hang me
I should say goodbye before I say hello
So darling hold me closely tonight
Because if you open your eyes Ill never let you go
Moving slowly well both sleep tonight
And well just be dreaming til you wake me up
Hush little baby dont you cry
I said hush little baby dont you cry
I said hush little baby dont you cry no
I said hush little baby dont you cry
I know I should say goodbye before I say hello
Darling hold me closely tonight
Because if you open your eyes Ill never let you go
Moving slowly well both sleep tonight
And well just be dreaming til you wake me upThis is the start of something beautiful
This is the start of something new
You are the one whod make me lose it all
You are the start of something new ooh
And Ill throw it all away
And watch you fall into my arms again
And Ill throw it all away
Watch you fall now
You are the earth that I will stand upon
You are the words that I will sing
And Ive thrown it all away
And watched you fall into his arms again
And I thrown it all away
Watched you fall now
And take me back
Take me home
Watch me fall
Down to earth
Take me back for
This is the start of something beautiful
You are the start of something newYoure not her
Though I try to see you differently
I tow the line
You see Im searching for what used to be mine
I saw your eyes
And then I saw her staring back at me
And I will try to find another one
Who suited me as well as her
I moved far away from you
And I want to see you here beside me dear
But things arent clear
When we never even tried
We never even talked
We never even thought in the long run
Whenever it was painful
Whenever I was away
Id miss you
I miss you
She was mine
I was hers
And all thats in between
If she would cry
I would shelter her
And keep her from the darkness that will be
If I moved far away from you
And I want to see you here beside me dear
But things arent clear
We never even tried
We never even talked
We never even thought in the long run
Whenever it was painful
Whenever I was away
Id miss you
And I miss you
Dont drop me in
Its not my turn
If you cut deep
Then I might learn
You scarred and left me
Like a sunburn
Dont drop me in
Its not my turn
If you cut deep
Then I might learn
You scar and leave me
Like a sunburn
We never even tried
We never even talked
We never even thought in the long run
Whenever it was painful
Whenever I was away
Id miss you
And I miss youI paid all my dues
And she wanted to know
That Id never leave her
Now Im ready to go
And strange as it seems
Shes endless to me
Shes just like paperwork
But harder to read
Patience my enemy
And lovings my friend
Its harder to leave
With my heart on my sleeve
Than to stay and just pretend
Oh she knows me so well
Oh she knows me like I know myself
I made all my plans
And she has made hers
She kept me in mind
But I wasnt sure
I searched every room
For a way to escape
But every time
I tried to leave
She keeps holding on to me
For dear life
And blocking my way
Patience my enemy
And lovings my friend
Its harder to leave
With my heart on my sleeve
Than to stay and just pretend
Oh she knows me so well
Oh she knows me like I know myselfI seem to find myself talking to the powers that be
Awaking the shade and shadowed under towering trees
Admiring the scene inhaling fumes of flowers that breathe
Jet-lagged eyes are begging for an hour to sleep
Although my blood shot whites and irises they never find any
Clock stops at times where the sunshine can blind many
Although my eyes are heavy they wont be closing soon
Cause I heard that time waits for nobody I suppose its true
We make corrosive tunes through acid tabs and vocables
To see the flashing lights at photo shoots we make our motive moves
I say whatever I feel to vent a rhyme
So I can still invent the lines and stay close to the friends of mine
Cause real will recognize real is what my father says
And Ill be sticking to this phrase until I pass away
Overworking no sleep is just another way to die slow
But Ill just keep going strong and never let my eyes close
Five oclock with lights off
Interview with a vampire
Sleep is for the living and not a utensil that I require
I swear I said that Ill sleep when Im dead
Whos on the beat upon the feature with Ed its D-E-V to the Z
Overtired pale-faced like Michael Myers
Bags underneath my eyes can show the baggage Ive acquired
And over the time within this maze Ill think youll find youll never find that piece of mind you seek to find until your dying
Cause I got too much to stay awake for to sleep or even take four seconds out the game
Its time to wage war
Scissors grab a sword and sharpen up your hunting knives
two psychopathic lyricists are driving on the hunt tonight
Im haling from the Essex and the East London boarder line
Villains never sleep the mastermind in all sorts of crimes
Be wide awake just like your snorting lines
Or get left mortified like youve just seen the ghost of Jesus walking by
Chorus
I never sleep
When trouble steals thoughts from my restless mind for free it could be
The times Im living in I never sleep when trouble steals thoughts from my restless Mind for free it could be
The times Im living in lately
I brush my teeth every night but still I wake up with a bad mouth
And the background is my past and my presence will bring it back out
Deliver the raps how I flow
I live with the raps now and those that hate me call me Ron
But they wont Slytherin too easy believe me Im Snape minded
Be within this great time be on minimum wage life is a prison escape that Im in
Its all to do with timing not the label that you sign with
Then my mates are doing fine but then they never put the time in
I try to hide my cold side like when I flip my pillows
Some of the the songs I write are real because the chart is filled with si-lo-con
Im still broke without the money for a Mac Pro living out of three bags no talk About my cash flow
Opposite of sober cause I never did my homework
Which has got me on the sofa no degree but growing older
I played a fool to catch the wise I will never tell a lie
Await death take deep breaths try to never die
Never die
Two guys with the same view keep it tight like screws
Making metaphors flow and move like typhoons and tunes
And if we got our eyes on you well catch you while you snooze
Times elapsing while your catching Zs the masses like to move
We scan the situation analyse information and then decide what probably is most Practical to do
Driven young gentlemen
Ive hardly changed my bed sheets at all over the last twelve months causeI havent Slept in them true
Im coming home the lights are on your rights are wrong so Im correcting em
We got the fans all like Oh wow its Devs and Ed what less did you bloody expect From em
In the end sleep deprivation might just be our detriment
Fighting through writers block from nine oclock to five oclock and no way will I ever Waste a second of the time I got
I keep my pupils engaged
Like a classroom in holy matrimony but Im only trying to stay awake
Chorus
I never sleep
When trouble steals thoughts from my restless mind for free it could be
The times Im living in I never sleep when trouble steals thoughts from my restless Mind for free it could be 
The times Im living in latelyI should ink my skin
With your name
And take my passport out again
And just replace it
See I could do without a tan
On my left hand where my fourth finger meets my knuckle
And I should run you a hot bath
And fill it up with bubbles
Cause maybe youre lovable
And maybe youre my snowflake
And your eyes turn from green to gray and in the winter Ill
Hold you in a cold place
And you should never cut your hair
Cause I love the way you flick it off your shoulder
And you will never know just how beautiful you are to me
But maybe Im just in love when you wake me up
And would you ever feel guilty
If you did the same to me
Would you make me a cup of tea
To open my eyes in the right way
And I know you love Shrek
Cause weve watched it twelve times
But maybe youre hoping for a fairy tale too
And if your DVD breaks today
You shoulda got a VCR
Cause I never owned a Blu-Ray
True say
And now Ive always been s at computer games and your brother always beats me
And if I lost I go all cross
And chuck all the controllers at the TV
And then youd laugh at me
And be asking me
If Im gonna be home next week
And then youd lie with me till I fall asleep
And flutter eyelash on my cheek between the sheets
And you will never know just how beautiful you are to me
But maybe Im just in love when you wake me up
I think you hate the smell of smoke
You always tryna get me to stop
But you drink as much as me
And I get drunk a lot
So Ill take you to the beach
And walk along the sand And Ill
Make you a heart pendant
With a pebble held in my hand
And Ill carve it like a necklace
So the heart falls where your chest is
And now a piece of me is a piece of the beach and it falls just where it needs to be
And rests peacefully
So you just need to breathe
To feel my heart against yours now
Against yours now
Cause maybe Im just in love when you wake me up
Or maybe Im just in love when you wake me up
Maybe I fell in love when you woke me upIf we take this bird in with its broken leg
We can nurse it she said
Come inside for a little lie down with me
And if you fall asleep it wouldnt be the worse thing
But when I wake up and your make up is on my shoulder
And tell me if I lie down would you stay now
And let me hold you oh
But if I kiss you will your mouth read this truth
Darling how I miss you strawberries taste how lips do
And its not complete yet mustnt get our feet wet
Cause that leads to regret diving in too soon
And Ill owe it all to you oh my little bird
My little bird
If we take a walk out in the morning dew
We can lie down so Im next to you
Come inside for a little home made tea
And if you fall asleep at least youre next to me
And if I wake up say its late love go back to sleep
Im covered by nature and Im safe now
Underneath this oak tree with you beside me
But if I kiss you will your mouth read this truth
Darling how I miss you strawberries taste how lips do
And its not complete yet mustnt get our feet wet
Cause that leads to regret diving in too soon
And Ill owe it all to you oh my little bird
My little bird
My little bird
My little bird
And of all these things Im sure of Im not quite certain of your love
You make me scream then I made you cry
When I left that little bird with its broken leg to die
But if I kiss you will your mouth read this truth
Darling how I miss you strawberries taste how lips do
And its not complete yet mustnt get our feet wet
Cause that leads to regret diving in too soon
But Ill owe it all to you oh my little bird
My little bird whoa oh oh oh whoa
My little bird
My little bird
Youre my little birdIn hotel rooms far away from home
I miss you more than you will know
Shine a light
Just one side
To think again
That your mine
Its high time
Im far away from home
Tell me that theres no where left to land
and Ill fall down
Catch me with the strength of your own hands
and Ill fall down
Oh I need you without you Ill fall apart
and last winter I need you to feed my heart
But all the night
Sky blue
Stars are bright
Shine through
Like you
And Im far away from home
Tell me that theres no where left to land
and Ill fall down
Catch me with the strength of your own hands
and Ill fall down
Tell me that theres no where left to land
and Ill fall down
Catch me with the strength of your own hands
and Ill fall downShes like cold coffee in the morning
Im drunk off last nights whisky and coke
Shell make me shiver without warning
And make me laugh as if Im in on the joke
And you can stay with me forever
Or you could stay with me for now
Tell me if Im wrong
Tell me if Im right
Tell me if you need a loving hand
To help you fall asleep tonight
Tell me if I know
Tell me if I do
Tell me how to fall in love the way you want me to
Ill wake with coffee in the morning
But she prefers two lumps of sugar and tea
Outside the day is up and calling
But I dont have to be so please go back to sleep
Stay with me forever
Or you could stay with me for now
Tell me if Im wrong
Tell me if Im right
Tell me if you need a loving hand
To help you fall asleep tonight
Tell me if I know
Tell me if I do
Tell me how to fall in love the way you want me to
Cause I love the way you wake me up
For goodness sake will my love not be enough
Tell me if Im wrong
Tell me if Im right
Tell me if you need a loving hand
To help you fall asleep tonight
Tell me if I know
Tell me if I do
Tell me how to fall in love the way you want me to
Tell me if Im wrong
Tell me if Im right
Tell me if you need a loving hand
To help you fall asleep tonightIm in so deep Omar Epps can relate to my situation on a real
Pain aint the emotion I wanna feel but Im thriving off it so its only right I like this topic
Ill be on a hill keeping my head above water
I cant afford to ever get caught in a corner
So I move with the force of a sorcerer
Its dark when Im about just me myself and my shadow
Im parro running out of ammo and it seems like everyone around me is on the same path so its narrow
The less then the better a more proof for the last one left so they dont leave me as wet as an umbrella
I play fool to catch wise are they ever gonna guess Im clever
How can I be at my best with this pressure
I got a lot to loose but when I watch the news my minds infected with terror
No wonder Im under stress I got my door kicked off by a bunch of feds
And when they left It looked like I had rave and invited more than a hundred guests
I should of bust the back door and jump the fence
It easy when you look back shoulda woulda coulda but I bet you cant bring should woulda could back
Back to fifteen I said to myself that Im more than a hood track
Ooh you can drag me in the deep ends
Ooh but you will never drown me out
Ooh you can drag me in the deep ends
Ooh but you will never drown me out out out
You wont drown me out out out
You wont drown me out
You cant ever drown me out the water supplies too low
And Im around about sixty-one ten stone
Ive never seen someone drown without a sufficient amount of liquid in their lungs
A violent MC my mouth can vouch
Do I sound like Im choking Seriously do I sound like Im joking
Im floating even though that they wanna send me to the bottom of the ocean
But I am a ship thats sunk many years Im maintaining
Plain sailing no commotion
Like a dolphin when its in motion
But i cant break me so why would I show them Im broken
No real shit throw my skin aint close to corrosion
Fuck em all this aint tug of war still dont get roped in the open I dont wanna reveal my violent side
But I swear that I will soon if the Lord above dont provide a sign
Then Ima kill you arm for arm eye for eye
Nah I just wanna live my life but you dont wanna see this guy survive
Ooh you can drag me in the deep ends
Ooh but you will never drown me out
Ooh you can drag me in the deep ends
Ooh but you will never drown me out out out
You wont drown me out
You wont drown me outLying in a bedroom
Lighting up a Benson
Face hair is growing
So I cut with a vengeance
Hey did I mention
As she makes an entrance
Said I had a tendency
To finish off a sentence
Oh well shes a local girl
No make-up
Cos she knows me well
Hair tied up in elastic band
With a kiss on the cheek
For her one-night man
Is it fast food
Ill regret it after
And I needed money
But Im too shy to ask her
So she buys me chips and cheese
And I tell her I love her
And shes all I need
I take it with a cold glass
Of the fruit and the barley
Shes still a sucker for the
Apple and Bacardi
Heading to the party
Sitting in the car seat
BEP on radio
It makes me feel naughty
She knows me well
Bit of a catch
To have a local girl
Hair tied up in elastic band
With a kiss on the cheek
For her one-night man
I dont wanna go alone
I dont wanna go alone
I dont wanna go alone
Tell her that I love her
Tell her that I need her
Tell her that shes more
Than a one-night stand
Tell her that she turns my cheeks
The colour of my hair
All I wanna do is be near
Tell her that I want her
Tell her that I need her
Tell her that shes more than a one-night stand
Tell her that I love her
More than anyone else
If you dont then Ill tell her myself
And weve got love in us
So if the drink kill us
Were gonna dance all night
Till the floor fillers
If we talk outside
I say I hate wasps too
I dont really dance
So Ill just watch you
Are you taking me back tonight
Tell me if thats alright
I dont wanna be here
Im not the sofa type
Tell me if you have a toothbrush
You dont mind sharing
She said I wanna take off
What youre wearing
I dont wanna go alone
I dont wanna go alone
I dont wanna go alone
Tell her that I love her
Tell her that I need her
Tell her that shes more
Than a one-night stand
Tell her that she turns my cheeks
The colour of my hair
All I wanna do is be near
Tell her that I want her
Tell her that I need her
Tell her that shes more
Than a one-night stand
Tell her that I love her
More than anyone else
If you dont Ill tell her myself
Shes like the fast food
Ill regret it after
And I needed money
But Im too shy to ask her
But she buys me chips and cheese
So I tell her that shes all I need
Tell her that shes more
Than a one-night stand
Tell her that she turns my cheeks
The colour of my hair
All I wanna do is be near
Tell her that shes more
Than a one-night stand
Tell her that I love her
More than anyone else
If you dont Ill tell her myself
Tell her that I love her
Tell her that I need her
That shes more
Than a one-night stand
Tell her that she turns my cheeks
The colour of my hair
All I wanna do is be near
Tell her that I want her
Tell her that I need her
Tell her that shes more
Than a one-night stand
Tell her that I love her
More than anyone else
If you dont Ill tell her myselfWhite lips pale face
Breathing in snowflakes
Burnt lungs sour taste
Lights gone days end
Struggling to pay rent
Long nights strange men
And they say
Shes in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since eighteen
But lately her face seems
Slowly sinking wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us
Cause were just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
And she dont want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
And sells love to another man
Its too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly
Ripped gloves rain coat
Tried to swim and stay afloat
Dry house wet clothes
Loose change bank notes
Weary-eyed dry throat
Call girl no phone
And they say
Shes in the class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since eighteen
But lately
her face seems
Slowly sinking wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us
Cause were just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
And she dont want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
And sells love to another man
Its too cold outside
For angels to fly
An angel will die
Covered in white
Closed eyed
And hoping for a better life
This time well fade out tonight
Straight down the line
And they say
Shes in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since eighteen
But lately her face seems
Slowly sinking wasting
Crumbling like pastries
They scream
The worst things in life come to free us
And were all under the upper hand
Go mad for a couple grams
And we dont want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe we fly to the Motherland
And sell love to another man
Its too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly
To fly fly
For angels to fly to fly to fly
Or angels to dieone thousand, seven hundred and thirty-eight

one thousand, seven hundred and thirty-eight
one thousand, seven hundred and thirty-eight
Got a sack for us to roll
one thousand, seven hundred and thirty-eightIm not a rapper Im a singer with a flow
Ive got a habit for spitting quicker lyrics you know
Youll find me ripping the written out of the pages they sit in
I never want to get bitten
Cause plagiarism is hidden
Watch how I sit on the rhythm
Prisoner with a vision
Signs of a label
But didnt listen to any criticism
Thought you knew but you didnt
So perk your ears up and listen
Studio is a system
And you could say that Im driven
And now its onto the next saga
We drink the best lager
Ill never try to win you over like your stepfather
I do my own thing now
And get respect after
And Im avoiding the caine
Like it was Get Carter
For four years I never had a place to stay
But its safe to say that it kept me grounded
Like a paper weight
At sixteen years old yeah I moved out of my home
I was Macy Gray I tried to say goodbye and I choked
Went from sleeping at a subway station
To sleeping with a movie star
And adding to the population
Not my imagination
I dont wanna relax
Would it hurt your reputation if I put it on wax
I take it back now
Mmmm come on and take it back love
Come on and take it back for us
Dont you fade into the back love
No
I take it back with the rhythm and blues
With my rap pack Ill be singing the news
Tryin act like Jack Black
When I bring it to school
I make a beat with my feet
By just hittin the loop
Bringing the lyrics to prove
That I can fit in these shoes
I give you the truth through the vocal booth
And stars burst out on the scene
Like an opal fruit
They try to take aim like Beckham when he goes to shoot
But then again thats what theyre supposed to do
And Im supposed to be calm
I tattooed the lyrics onto my arm
Whispering everything that happens
Is from now on
Ill be ready to start again
By the end of the song
Since they are claiming I handled it wrong
But then Ive never had an enemy
Except the NME but Ill be selling
Twice as many copies as their magazine will ever be
With only spectacles ahead of me
And festival fees are healthier than a Dalmatian on pedigree
Singing for the masses rubber dingied rapids
I keep this rapping a habit and keep on fashioning magic
Im battling for respect and I dont know if I have it
This songs from the heart cover the planet
I take it back now
Mmmm come on and take it back love
Come on and take it back for us
Dont you fade into the back love
No
And take it back now
Now I dont ever wanna be perfect
Cause Im a singer that you never wanna see shirtless
And I accept the fact that someones got to win worst dressed
Taken my first steps into the scene giving me focus
Putting on a brave face like Timothy Dalton
Considering a name change thinking it was hopeless
Rhyming over recordings avoiding tradition
Cause every days some lyrics and a melody can be written
Now absence can make your heart ache
But drinking absinth can change your mind state
Vividly need to let my liver be
And Ill say it again living life on the edge with a close handful of friends
Is good advice from the man that took his life on the road with me
And I hope to see him blowing up globally
Cause that how its supposed to be
Im screaming out vocally
It might seem totally impossible achieving lifes dreams
But but I just write schemes
Im never having a stylist giving me tight jeans
Madison Square Garden is where I might be
But more likely you find me in the back room of a dive bar with my mates having a pint of Mcdaid discussing records we made and every single second knowing that well never betray the way we were raised remembering our background sat down thats how we plan it out
Its time to take it back now
Mmmm come on and take it back love
Come on and take it back for us
Dont you fade into the back love
No
Mmm come on and take it back love
Come on and take it back for us
Dont you fade into the back love
No
Album version stops here
My dreams keep me awake at night
Written in rhymes til I deliver the hype
Am I just living the lie
With this you must know that the numbers just sold whoa
Will keep me going through the tough times dream with me
We forget ninety per cent of it when we wake
But the other ten per cent it never fades
Dreaming dreams day to day goals
Stay awake loads try to make the cut like the
Paper or razor blade oh never give up
And just remember just to hold out more
A couple years ago
I couldnt just control that thought
Youd find me buskin on the street
When it was cold outdoors
And now Im sweating on the stage of a sold out tour
Writing love songs for the sake of it
Never to make a hit
You cant fake talent and work ethic just to make it quick
Im not a rapper Im a singer I just take the piss and
Most of these other guys are kids that Pulses
Little sister has to babysit thats just the way it is
Dreams you own just set your goals
And have the utmost faith in it tread your own path
Youll never make it as a follower youll never know
Where you will go or where you will be tomorrow rha
by Mees_thirteen in ig and twLoving can hurt loving can hurt sometimes
But its the only thing that I know
When it gets hard you know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive
We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts are never broken
And times forever frozen still
So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me closer til our eyes meet
You wont ever be alone wait for me to come home
Loving can heal loving can mend your soul
And its the only thing that I know know
I swear it will get easier
Remember that with every piece of you
Hm and its the only thing we take with us when we die
Hm we keep this love in this photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts were never broken
And times forever frozen still
So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me closer til our eyes meet
You wont ever be alone
And if you hurt me
Thats okay baby only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I wont ever let you go
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
You can fit me
Inside the necklace you got when you were sixteen
Next to your heartbeat where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul
And if you hurt me
Well thats okay baby only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I wont ever let you go
When Im away I will remember how you kissed me
Under the lamppost back on Sixth street
Hearing you whisper through the phone
Wait for me to come homeWhen your legs dont work like they used to before
And I cant sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks
And darling I will be loving you til were seventy
And baby my heart could still fall as hard at twenty-three
And Im thinking bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Oh me I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am
So honey now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
Im thinking out loud
Maybe we found love right where we are
When my hairs all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds dont remember my name
When my hands dont play the strings the same way mm
I know you will still love me the same
Cause honey your soul can never grow old its evergreen
Baby your smiles forever in my mind and memory
Im thinking bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe its all part of a plan
Ill just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that youll understand
But baby now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
Im thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are oh
Ah la la la la la la la la la la la la

And youre still in my bed
Its kinda rough cause since I met ya
Theres things weve never said
So if I go for a little while longer
When Im home we can talk about the pitfalls of the road
If you say go
I would stop everything oh
My heart would play the role now
And act like its never been broke
Though my soul
Oh oh oh
Lately I really need to know
How long how long can we be touch-and-go
Oh my soul oh oh oh
How long how long can we be touch-and-go
Its not enough to say I want ya

Burning fires in this room
It just fits light and smooth
Like my feet in my shoes
Little one lie with me
Sew you heart to my sleeve
Well stay quiet underneath
Shooting stars if it helps you sleep
And hold me tight dont let me breathe
Feeling like you wont believe
Theres a firefly loose tonight
Better catch it before it burns this place down
And I lie if I dont feel so right
But the world looks better through your eyes
Theres a firefly loose tonight
Better catch it before it burns this place down
And I lie if I dont feel so right
But the world looks better through your eyes
Teach my skin those new tricks
Warm me up with your lips

Close your eyes lean on me
Face to mouth lips to cheek
Feeling numb in my feet
Youre the one
To help me get to sleep

Feeling like you wont believe
Theres a firefly loose tonight
Better catch it before it burns this place down

I woke up early looking out my window
At the Amsterdam sky
Oh baby I was high last night
Cafe clouds and red lights
When I gotcha in mind
You slowed down time
Oh baby I was out of my mind
Sing a song cover and hold me tight
I drill you deep into my chest
Thats where it feels the best
You can remove all the scars
Stop them from breaking my heart
Been on a hurting spree
That brought out the worst in me
cause I dont want to be alone
cause everyday that Im breathing I think you are the one
I love the way that your sweet words just roll off of my tongue
Feel the flame of your wisdom and fill up my lungs
Sweet Mary Jane wont you sing another song
CafÃ clouds and shooting stars are floating across the sky
Oh baby what a beautiful sight
But were only satellites
Oh di ba di ba oh la lights
Oh baby I am so damn high
Have you seen my eyes
With the beat beat of my heart
You take me back to the start
Where everything began
Holding you inside my hands
Between my fingers and thumb
I seal you in with my tongue
Cause I dont want to be alone
Cause everyday that Im breathing I think you are the one
I love the way that your sweet words just roll off of my tongue
Feel the flame of your wisdom and fill up my lungs
Sweet Mary Jane wont you me sing another song
Na na na na na Sweet Mary Jane

Oooh Oooh Oooh Oooh Oooooh
Yo hot damn Doc a Jam like a Summer Show
I keep my car looking like a crash dummy drove
My gear look like the bank got my money froze
For dead presidents I pimp like Huddy roll
Doc the one that excite ya divas ow
If the media shine Im shining with both of the sleeves up
Yo Christina what better hop in here
My block live and in color like Rodman hair han
The club is packed the bar is filled
Im waiting for sister to act like Lauryn Hill
Frankly its a rap no bargain deals
I drive a four wheel ride with foreign wheels
Throw it up baby its Brick City I heard of that
We blessed and hung low like Bernie Mac Bernie Mac
Dogs let em out women let em in
Its like Im ODB the way Im gonna get
Rowdy
Gonna get a little unruly
Get it fired up in a hurry
Wanna get dirrty
Its about time that I came to start the party
Sweat dripping over my body
Dancing getting just a little naughty
Wanna get dirrty its about time for my arrival
Rowdy
Gonna get a little unruly
Get it fired up in a hurry
Wanna get dirrty
Its about time that I came to start the party
Sweat dripping over my body
Dancing getting just a little naughty
Wanna get dirrty its about time for my arrival
WhatShes reinventing loving me
When were resembling cutlery on the sofa
It must have been about five hundred and one
Like my blue ripped jeans
And my eyes are closed
And Im way too tired
Hoody still smells of the beach bonfire
On the sofa where we lay
I wanna stay inside all day
And its cold outside again
And were both so high
We could fly to Berlin Tokyo or Jamaica
We can go where you want
Say the word and Ill take ya
But Id rather stay on the sofa
On the sofa with you
When the morning comes
Were not watching Formula I
Its not what we breathe for
So kick off the day with Friends on Tfour
Two boiled and brew
Two sugars aint too sweet for you
On the sofa where we lay
I wanna stay inside all day
And its cold outside again
And were still so high
We could fly to Berlin Tokyo or Jamaica
We can go where you want
Say the word and Ill take ya
But Id rather stay on the sofa
On the sofa with youAcross the sea
By the Tennessee skyline
They told me Id find my
Hopes and my dreams
I long to be
In the bed of my true love
Back where I came from
Shes waiting for me
So I make my way
Through long winding country roads
But my heart still beats
For my home and my English rose
I told my dad
On the phone its amazing
From the straight to the crazy the places Ive been
I long to be
In the arms of my true love
Like he loves my mother
He understands me
And I spend my days
Just traveling and playing shows
And my heart still beats
For my home and my English rose
Oooo-ooo-oooh
Oooo-aaa-aaah
Oo-aaa-aaa-aaah
I met a man
In the bar down in Munford
And he told me he went there to follow his dreams
He told me son
You know I left my true love
For the same exact reason
You crossed the sea
And I found truth
In people Ive never known
And my heart still beats for my home and my English rose
And my heart still beats for my home and my English rose
And my heart still beats for my home and my English rose
Across the sea
By the Tennessee skyline
They told me Id find my
Hopes and my dreams
I long to be
In the bed of my true love
Back where I came from
Shes waiting for me
So I make my way
Through long winding country roads

Keep careful watch of my brothers souls
And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke
Keep watching over Durins son
If this is to end in fire
Then we should all burn together
Watch the flames climb high into the night
Calling out for the rope sent by and we will
Watch the flames burn on and on the mountain side hey
And if we should die tonight
Then we should all die together
Raise a glass of wine for the last time
Calling out for the rope
Prepare as we will
Watch the flames burn on and on the mountain side
Desolation comes upon the sky
Now I see fire inside the mountain
I see fire burning the trees
And I see fire hollowing souls
And I see fire blood in the breeze
And I hope that youll remember me
Oh should my people fall
Then surely Ill do the same
Confined in mountain halls
We got too close to the flame
Calling out father hold fast and we will
Watch the flames burn on and on the mountain side
Desolation comes upon the sky
Now I see fire inside the mountain
I see fire burning the trees
And I see fire hollowing souls
And I see fire blood in the breeze
And I hope that youll remember me
And if the night is burning
I will cover my eyes
For if the dark returns then
My brothers will die
And as the skys falling down
It crashed into this lonely town
And with that shadow upon the ground
I hear my people screaming out
Now I see fire inside the mountain
I see fire burning the trees
And I see fire hollowing souls
And I see fire blood in the breeze
I see fire oh you know I saw a city burning fire
And I see fire feel the heat upon my skin fire
And I see fire fire
And I see fire burn on and on and mountains sideYou look so wonderful in your dress
I love your hair like that
The way it falls on the side of your neck
Down your shoulders and back
We are surrounded by all of these lies
And people who talk too much
Youve got that kind of look in your eyes
As if no one knows anything but us
And should this be the last thing I see
I want you to know its enough for me
Cause all that you are is all that Ill ever need
Im so in love so in love
So in love so in love
You look so beautiful in this light
Your silhouette over me
The way it brings out the blue in your eyes
Is the Tenerife sea
And all of the voices surrounding us here
They just fade out when you take a breath
Just say the word and I will disappear
Into the wilderness
And should this be the last thing I see
I want you to know its enough for me
Cause all that you are is all that Ill ever need
Im so in love so in love
So in love so in love

Lumiere over me

This is freaking awesome
Now Im pop some tags
Only got twenty dollars in my pocket
I-I-Im hunting looking for a come-up
This is freaking awesomeI write this song in memory of
The wayward smile
The boy we wont forget
The soul you took away from us
The river flows
The tears that we wept
Missing you
Is all that needs to be said
More than blue
The words inside my head
And I know that youre gone
The cheeky smile
Of jokes and laughs
The memories of times
We crossed the line
The stepping stones
Across my mind
Washed away
We all now feel so blind
Missing you
Is all that needs to be said
More than blue
The words inside my head
And I know that youre gone
GoodbyeI met this girl late last year
She said dont you worry if I disappear
I told her Im not really looking for another mistake
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jumped right in a week later returned
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you can swing by my room around ten
Baby bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
Well be in between the sheets till the late AM
Baby if you wanted me then you should have just said
Shes singing
Dont fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my own
I dont wanna know that babe
Dont fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I dont wanna know that babe
For a couple of weeks I only want to see her
We drink away the days with a take away pizza
Before a text message was the only way to reach her
Now shes staying at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha all over the track like a feature
And never wants to sleep I guess that I dont want to either
But me and her we make money the same way
Four cities two planes the same day
And those shows have never been what its about
Maybe well go together and just figure it out
Id rather put on a film with you and sit on the couch
But we should get on the plane or well be missing it now
Wish Id have written it down the way that things played out
When she was kissing him how
I was confused about
She should figure it out
Why Im sat here singing
Dont with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my own
I dont wanna know that babe
Dont fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I dont wanna know that babe
On my hotel door
I dont even know if she knows what for
She was crying on my shoulder
I already told you
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next
But you didnt need to to take him to bed thats all
And I never saw him as a threat
Until you disappeared with him to have sex of course
Its not like we were both on tour
We were staying on the same hotel floor
And I wasnt looking for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realize that you want it
Its a bit too much too late if Im honest
And all this time God knows Im singing
Dont fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my own
I dont wanna know that babe
Dont fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I dont wanna know that babe
Dont fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my own
I dont wanna know that babe
Dont fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I dont wanna know that babeHmhmhmhm ah ah
Hmhmhmhm ah ah
Hmhmhmhm ah ah
Hmhmhmhm ah ah
Ive known it for a long time
Daddy wakes up to a drink at night
Disappearing all night
I dont wanna know where hes been lying
I know what I wanna do
I wanna runaway
Runaway with you
Gonna grab clothes socks in the morning go
How long you leaving
Well Dad just dont expect me back this evening
Oh it could take a bit of time to heal this
Its been a long day
Almost out of the wrong way but
I love him from the skin to my bones ah
But I dont wanna miss home ah
Theres nothing to save and he knows ah
Ill just runaway in the overnight
Ive never seen my dad cry
Cold as stone and the kitchen lie
I tell you its about time
But I was raised to keep quiet
And this is what Im gonna do
Gonna runaway gonna make that move
Gonna grab clothes and when its morning go
How long you leaving
Well Dad just dont expect me back this evening
Oh it could take a bit of time to heal this
Its been a long day
Almost out of the wrong way but
I love him from the skin to my bones ah
But I dont wanna miss home ah
Theres nothing to save and he knows ah
Ill just runaway in the overnight
Back pack and a flat cap turned to the back
Cause I packed my clothes
My dad wasnt in with that plan too bit tired and turns to show up
I dont wanna live this way
Gonna take my things and go
If things change in a matter of days
Could be persuaded to hold up
And mama was the same
None of us the same
To get the good nose up
I dont wanna runaway
And one of these days I might just show that
Put my home in a suitcase
Tie both shoelaces and hold that
Things change but for now I leave town with a backpack on my shoulder
I love him from the skin to my bones ah
But I dont wanna miss home ah
Theres nothing to save and he knows ah
Ill just runaway in the overnightOoh Im a mess right now
Inside out
Searching for a sweet surrender
But this is not the end
I cant work it out
How
Going through the motions
Going through us
And though Ive known it for the longest time
And all my hope
All my words are all over written on the signs
But youre my road walking me home
Home home home home
See the flames inside my eyes
It burns so bright I wanna feel your love
Oh oh easy baby maybe Im a light
Before tonight I wanna fall in love
And put your faith in my stomach
I messed up this time
Late last night
Drinking to suppress devotion
With fingers intertwined
I cant shake this feeling now
Were going through the motions
Hoping youd stop
And though Ive only caused you pain
You know with all of my words
With were always beloved
Although all the lies spoke
When youre my road walking me home
Home home home home
See the flames inside my eyes
It burns so bright I wanna feel your love
Oh easy baby maybe Im a light
Before tonight I wanna fall in love
And put your faith in my stomach
And for how long Ive loved my lover
For how long Ive loved my lover
And now now for how long long Ive loved my lover
Now now for how long long Ive loved my lover
Now now for how long long Ive loved my lover
And I feel loved
For how long long Ive loved my lover

And I feel love
For how long long Ive loved my lover now now
For how long long Ive loved my loverI didnt mean to break your heart
I was just lonely
And everybody falls apart sometimes
I know youve found another one
But wont you just hold me tonight
I wish I never called you up
Nobody told me
And they dont know we dont speak anymore
So take a good look at us
Wont you just hold me tonight
And I will stop trying to fall in love again
And keep it a secret
It never works out anyway
But I am not anything like I was
Cause you were the only one for me
Yeah yeah
Cause maybe I dont wanna lose a lover and friend in one night
If thats right
I shouldnt have fucked with your mind
And your life too many times
Or maybe I dont wanna be lonely
Darling you are my only love
Behind my truth lies everything you are
I never meant to sleep around
I was just lonely
You did the same again and again and again
Oh I know
So heres to the both of us
Heres to our story tonight
Oh I will stop trying to fall in love again
And keep it a secret
It never works out anyway
But I am not anything like I was
Cause you were the only one for me
Hmm yeah
Maybe I dont wanna lose a lover and friend in one night
If thats right
I shouldnt have fucked with your mind
And your life too many times
Or maybe I dont wanna be lonely
Darling you are my only love
Behind my truth lies everything you are
When I see my future
It is with you
Well get there
I want my children to be with you
Well get there
hmm yeah
Cause maybe I dont wanna lose a lover and friend in one night
If thats right
I shouldnt have fucked with your mind
And your life too many times
Or maybe I dont wanna be lonely
Darling you are my only love
Behind my truth lies everything you are
Behind my truth lies everything you are
Behind my truth lies everything you areIts alright to cry
Even my dad does sometimes
So dont wipe your eyes
Tears can remind you of life
Its alright to die
If thats the only thing you havent tried
But just for tonight hold on
So live life like youre giving up
Cause you act like you are
Go ahead and just live it up
Go on and tear me apart
Its alright to shake
even my hand does sometimes
So inside well rage
Against the dying of the light
Its alright to say
that thats the only thing youve ever tried
But just for today
Hold On
So live life like youre giving up
Cause you act like you are
Go ahead and just live it up
Go on and tear me apart
Hold on
Live life like youre giving up
cause you act like you are
Go ahead and just live it up
Go on and tear me apart
and hold onThings were all good yesterday
And then the devil took your memory
And if you fell to your death today
I hope that heaven is your resting place
I heard the doctors put your chest in pain
But then that could have been the medicine
And now youre lying in the bed again
Either way Ill cry with the rest of them
And my father told me son
Its not his fault he doesnt know your face
And youre not the only one
Although my grandma used to say he used to say
Darling hold me in your arms the way you did last night
And well lie inside a little while he wrote
I could look into your eyes until the sun comes up
And were wrapped in light in life in love
Put your open lips on mine and slowly let them shut
For theyre designed to be together oh
With your body next to mine our hearts will beat as one
And were set alight were afire love love love oh
And things were all good yesterday
Then the devil took your breath away
And now were left here in the pain
Black suit black tie standin in the rain
And now my family is one again
Stapled together with the strangers and a friend
Came to my mind I should paint it with a pen
Six years old I remember when
And my father told me son
Its not his fault he doesnt know your face
And youre not the only one
Although my grandma used to say he used to say
Darling hold me in your arms the way you did last night
And well lie inside a little while he wrote
I could look into your eyes until the sun comes up
And were wrapped in light in life in love
Put your open lips on mine and slowly let them shut
For theyre designed to be together oh
With your body next to mine our hearts will beat as one
And were set alight were afire love love love oh
And my father and all of my family
Rise from the seats to sing hallelujah
And my mother and all of my family
Rise from the seats to sing halellujah
And my brother and all of my family
Rise from the seats to sing hallelujah
And all of my brothers and my sisters yeah
And my father and all of my family
Rise from the seats to sing hallelujah
HallelujahI met you when I was a teen
But then you were one as well
And I could play the guitar
Just like ringing the bells
Sometimes I wonder
And any other summer could you have been my part time lover
To me listening to Stevie Wonder
Under the covers where we used to lay
And read stacks while the speakers play
Ill be on tour almost every day
When I was home up in my flat is where we used to stay
Just watching the DVD smoking illegal weed
Getting high two cars we needed to breathe
We used each others edge just for the people to see
And stay up all night like when we needed to sleep
We go anywhere our minds would take us
And also you are beautiful without your make-up
And you dont even need to worry about your weight cause
We can all be loved the way that God made us
And times the only reason that we could break up
Cause you would always tell me Imma wait too much
Distance is relative to the time that it takes to get on a plane
Or make a mistake say it again
Oh Nina
You should go Nina
Cause I aint never coming home
In a road wont you leave me now
And Ive been living on the road Nina
And then again you should know Nina
Cause thats you and me
Both in a road wont you leave me now
Now
And every weekend in the winter
Youd be wearing my hood
With jewels strings pulled tight
To keep your face in the cold
Taking day trips to the local
Where we D on the road
Cause every day when I was a baby
Dont you speak on the phone
Watching Blue Planet
Creating new habits
And if we were two rabbits
And then youd vanish
Back to burrow all of the queltics are disappearing
You call me selfish I dont understand
But I cant help it
I put my trouble for everything
Except my family and friends
But youll be in between forever
So I guess well have to take a step back
Overlook the situation
Cause mixing business and feelings will only lead to complications
And Im not saying we should be taking a break
Just re-evaluating quick before we make a mistake and its too late
So we can either deal with the pain
Or wait to get on the plane
But in the day well have to say it again
Oh Nina
You should go Nina
Cause I aint never coming home
In a road wont you leave me now
And Ive been living on the road Nina
And then again you should know Nina
Cause thats you and me
Both in a road wont you leave me now
Now
Love will come and love will go
But you can make it on your own
Sing that song go oh wont you leave me now
People grow and fall apart
But you can mend your broken heart
Take it back oh wont you leave me now
Oh Nina Love will come and love will go
You should go Nina But you can make it on your own
Cause I aint never coming home Sing that song go
In a road wont you leave me now
And Ive been living on the road Nina People grow and fall apart
And then again you should know Nina But you can mend your broken heart
Cause thats you and me Take it back
Both in a road wont you leave me now
Now
Oh Nina Love will come and love will go
You should go Nina But you can make it on your own
Cause I aint never coming home Sing that song go
In a road wont you leave me now
And Ive been living on the road Nina People grow and fall apart
And then again you should know Nina But you can mend your broken heart
Cause thats you and me Take it back
Both in a road wont you leave me now
NowWhen your legs dont work like they used to before
And I cant sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks
And darling I will be loving you til were seventy
And baby my heart could still fall as hard at twenty-three
And Im thinking bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Oh me I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am
So honey now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
Im thinking out loud
Maybe we found love right where we are
When my hairs all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds dont remember my name
When my hands dont play the strings the same way mm
I know you will still love me the same
Cause honey your soul can never grow old its evergreen
Baby your smiles forever in my mind and memory
Im thinking bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe its all part of a plan
Ill just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that youll understand
But baby now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
Im thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are oh
Ah la la la la la la la la la la la la
So baby now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Oh darling place your head on my beating heart
Im thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are
Oh maybe we found love right where we are
And we found love right where we areYou and I two of a mind
This loves one of a kind
You and I were drifting
Over the edge
And I will fall for you
And I will fall for you
If I fall for you
Would you fall too
You and I learning to speak
With kisses on cheek
You and I were lifted over the edge
And I will fall for you
And I will fall for you
If I fall for you
Would you fall too
And I will fall for you
And I will fall for you
And if I fall for you
Would you fall too
Would you fall too
Would you fall too
Would you fall too
Would you fall tooI can taste salt water
And if I blink again
Youll be sinking in
So well learn to swim in the oceans you made
Ill hold ya and youll think of him
And pretty soon youll be floating away
And Ill hold on to the words you spoke of
Anchored down in the throat love
And Im captain of this sinking boat now
With just one armband to carry me home
When salted tears wont dry
Ill wipe my shirtsleeves
Under your eyes
These hearts will be flooded tonight
Ill wipe my shirtsleeves
Under your eyes
Your eyes your eyes your eyes your eyes your eyes
I still taste salt water
On my lips from your kiss bitterness
And Ill drown within the oceans you made
And I hate to love you these cuffs are covered in your make up
Ill never trust you again
You can just be a friend
And Ill hold on to the words you spoke of
Anchored down in the throat love
And Im captain of this sinking boat now
With just one armband to carry me home
When salted tears wont dry
Ill wipe my shirtsleeves
Under your eyes
These hearts will be flooded tonight
Ill wipe my shirtsleeves
Under your eyes
Your eyes your lips your mouth
Your thighs your back you drive me wild
Tonight the fact is I
Im on my way home
Im on my way home
I lied I tried to cry but Im Im drowning in the oceans you made
When salted tears wont dry
Ill wipe my shirtsleeves
Under your eyes
These hearts will be flooded tonight
Ill wipe my shirtsleeves
Under your eyes
Your eyes your eyes your eyes your eyes your eyesOoh Im a mess right now
Inside out
Searching for a sweet surrender
But this is not the end
I cant work it out
How
Going through the motions
Going through us
And though Ive known it for the longest time
And all my hope
All my words are all over written on the signs
But youre my road walking me home
Home home home home
See the flames inside my eyes
It burns so bright I wanna feel your love
Oh oh easy baby maybe Im a light
Before tonight I wanna fall in love
And put your faith in my stomach
I messed up this time
Late last night
Drinking to suppress devotion
With fingers intertwined
I cant shake this feeling now
Were going through the motions
Hoping youd stop
And though Ive only caused you pain
You know with all of my words
With were always beloved
Although all the lies spoke
When youre my road walking me home
Home home home home
See the flames inside my eyes
It burns so bright I wanna feel your love
Oh easy baby maybe Im a light
Before tonight I wanna fall in love
And put your faith in my stomach
And for how long Ive loved my lover
For how long Ive loved my lover
And now now for how long long Ive loved my lover
Now now for how long long Ive loved my lover
Now now for how long long Ive loved my lover
And I feel loved
For how long long Ive loved my lover
Feel it all over now now
And I feel love
For how long long Ive loved my lover
Feel it all over now now
And I feel love
For how long long Ive loved my lover
Feel it all over now now
And I feel love
For how long long Ive loved my lover
Feel it all over now now
And I feel love
For how long long Ive loved my lover
I feel it all over now now
And I feel love
For how long long Ive loved my lover now now
For how long long Ive loved my loverNow Im in town break it down thinking of making a new sound
Playing a different show every night in front of a new crowd
Thats you now ciao seems that life is great now
See me lose focus as I sing to you loud
And I cant no I wont hush
Ill say the words that make you blush
Im gonna sing this now
See Im true my songs are where my heart is
Im like glue I stick to other artists
Im not you now that would be disastrous
Let me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures
See Im real I do it all its all me
Im not fake dont ever call me lazy
I wont stay put give me the chance to be free
Suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me
Cause you need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you at all
You need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you at all
You need me
I sing and write my own tune
And I write my own verso
Dont need another word-smith to make my tune sell
Call yourself a singer-writer Youre just bluffing
Your names on the credits and you didnt write nothing
I sing fast I know that all my shits cool
I will blast and I didnt go to Brit School
I came fast with the way I act right
I cant last if Im smoking on a crack pipe
And I wont be a product of my genre
My mind will always be stronger than my songs are
Never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya
Always read the stories that you hear on Wikipedia
And musically Im demonstrating
When I perform live feels like I am meditating
Times at the Enterprise when some fella filmed me
A young singer-writer like Gabriella Cilmi
Cause you need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you at all
You need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you at all
You need me
Cause with the lyrics Ill be aiming it right
I wont stop till my names in light
At Stadium Heights with Damien Rice
On red carpets now Im on arabian nights
Because Im young and all my brothers gonna give me advice
Long nighter short height and Im gone hyper
Never be anything but a singer-songwriter
The games over but now Im on a new level
Watch how I step on the track without a loop pedal
People think that Im bound to blow up
Ive done around about a thousand shows
But I havent got a house plus I live on the couch
So you can be the lyrics when Im singing them out wow
From day one Ive been prepared
With Vfive wax for my ginger hair
So now Im back to the sofa giving a dose of what the future holds
Cause its another day plus Ill keep my last name forever keep the genre pretty basic
Gonna be breaking into other peoples tunes when I chase it
And replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift
Into another rappers shoes using new laces
Selling cds from my rucksack aiming for the papers
Selling cds from my rucksack aiming for majors
Nationwide til were just jack soon as I get the bus back
Clean cut kid without a razor for the mustache
I hit back when the pen hurts me
Im still a choir boy in a French church tee
Im still the same as a year ago
But more people hear me though
According to the myspace and youtube videos
Im always doing shows if Im not Im in the studio
Truly broke never growing up call me Ruffio
Melody music maker
Reading all the papers
They say Im up and coming like Im fucking in an elevator
Cause you need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you at all
You need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you at all
You need me man I dont need youLoving can hurt
Loving can hurt sometimes
But its the only thing that I know
When it gets hard
You know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive
We keep this love in a photograph
We make these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts are never broken
And times forever frozen still
So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me close until our eyes meet
You wont ever be alone
Wait for me to come home
Loving can heal
Loving can mend your soul
And its the only thing that I know know
I swear it will get easier
Remember that with every piece of ya
And its the only thing we take with us when we die
We keep this love in this photograph
We make these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Our hearts were never broken
And times forever frozen still
So you can keep me
inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me close until our eyes meet
You wont ever be alone
And if you hurt me
Thats okay baby there ll be worse things
Inside these pages you just hold me
I wont ever let you go
Wait for me to come home 
Oh you can keep me
Inside the necklace you got when you were sixteen
Next to your heartbeat where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul
And if you hurt me
Oh thats okay baby only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I wont ever let you go
When Im away
I will remember how you kissed me
Under the lamppost back on sixth street
Hearing you whisper through the phone
Wait for me to come homeGoodbye Norma Jean
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
They crawled out of the woodwork
And they whispered into your brain
They set you on the treadmill
And they made you change your name
And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would have liked to have known you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did
Loneliness was tough
The toughest role you ever played
Hollywood created a superstar
And pain was the price you paid
Even when you died
Oh the press still hounded you
All the papers had to say
Was that Marilyn was found in the nude
Goodbye Norma Jean
From the young man in the twenty-twond row
Who sees you as something as more than sexual
More than just our Marilyn MonroeYouve got scars on your body and your soul
Bruises on your back now
Broken heart with nowhere to go
Living in a high-rise flat
Torn apart so keep on keeping it together
Nothing is forever you know
You can start again like this like this
Chorus
Now I see blood in the sky
Blood in my eyesight
And everythings turning to red
Well beat it away color the nightlife
And light me up burn me today
Im seeing blood in the skyline
Stuck in the right mind
Afraid again to leave any dream
And replace it with anything better
So get up
And take away your scars
You can never be alone if youre bleeding with the skyline
Waiting for the right time
When the nights already gone
Its been traveling without your mind now
Let it let go and fuel you
Like petrol you find so much
Beauty in what makes you mental
Your friends know its only
A state of mind youre only getting by
By always getting high thats why
Chorus
Now I see blood in the sky
Blood in my eyesight
And everythings turning to red
Well beat it away color the nightlife
And light me up burn me today
Im seeing blood in the skyline
Stuck in the right mind
Afraid again to leave any dream
And replace it with anything better
So get up
And take away your scars
You can take away your scars
You can take away your scarsI met this girl late last year
She said dont you worry if I disappear
I told her Im not really looking for another mistake
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jumped right in a week later returned
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you can swing by my room around ten
Baby bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
Well be in between the sheets till the late AM
Baby if you wanted me then you should have just said
Shes singing
Dont fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my own
I dont wanna know that babe
Dont fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I dont wanna know that babe
For a couple of weeks I only want to see her
We drink away the days with a take away pizza
Before a text message was the only way to reach her
Now shes staying at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha all over the track like a feature
And never wants to sleep I guess that I dont want to either
But me and her we make money the same way
Four cities two planes the same day
And those shows have never been what its about
Maybe well go together and just figure it out
Id rather put on a film with you and sit on the couch
But we should get on the plane or well be missing it now
Wish Id have written it down the way that things played out
When she was kissing him how
I was confused about
She should figure it out
Why Im sat here singing
Dont with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my own
I dont wanna know that babe
Dont fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I dont wanna know that babe
On my hotel door
I dont even know if she knows what for
She was crying on my shoulder
I already told you
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next
But you didnt need to to take him to bed thats all
And I never saw him as a threat
Until you disappeared with him to have sex of course
Its not like we were both on tour
We were staying on the same hotel floor
And I wasnt looking for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realize that you want it
Its a bit too much too late if Im honest
And all this time God knows Im singing
Dont fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my own
I dont wanna know that babe
Dont fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I dont wanna know that babe
Dont fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my own
I dont wanna know that babe
Dont fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I dont wanna know that babeNo I dont wanna hate you
Just wish youd never gone for the man
And waited two weeks at least
Before you let him take you
I stayed true
I kind of knew you liked the dude from private school
Hes waiting for the time to move
I knew he had his eyes on you
Hes not the right guy for you
Dont hate me cause I write the truth
No I would never lie to you
But it was never fine to lose you
And what a way to find out
It never came from my mouth
You never changed your mind
But you were just afraid to mind out
But f- it I wont be changing the subject I love it
Ill make your little secret public its nothing
Im just disgusted with the skeletons you sleep with in your closet to get back at me
Trapped and Im lacking sleep
Fact is youre mad at me because I backtrack so casually
Youre practically my family
If we married then Ill guess youd have to be
But tragically our love just lost the will to live
But would I kill to give it one more shot
I think not
I dont love you baby
I dont need you baby
I dont want you no
Anymore
I dont love you baby
I dont need you baby
I dont wanna love you no
Anymore
Recently I tend to zone out
Up in my headphones to Holocene
You promised your body but Im away so much
I stay more celibate than in a monastery
Im not cut out for life on the road
Cause I didnt know Id miss you this much
And at the time wed just go so sue me
I guess Im not the man that you need
Ever since you went to uni
Ive been sofa surfing with a rucksack
Full of less cash and I guess that could get bad
But when I broke the industry
Thats when I broke your heart
I was supposed to chart and celebrate
But good things are over fast
I know its hard to deal with and see this
I tend to turn you off and switch on my professional features
Then I turn the music off
And all Im left with is to pick up my personal pieces Jesus
I never really want to believe this
Got advice from my dad and he
Told me that family is all Ill ever have and need
I guess Im unaware of it
Success is nothing if you have no one left to share it with
I dont love you baby
I dont need you baby
I dont want you no
Anymore
I dont love you baby
I dont need you baby
I dont wanna love you no
Anymore
And since you left
Ive given up my days off
Its what I need to stay strong
I know you have a day job
But mine is two hundred and forty-seven
I feel like writing a book
I guess I lied in the hook
Cause I still love you and I need you by my side if I could
The irony is if my career and music didnt exist
In six years yeah youd probably be my wife with a kid
Im frightened to think if I depend on cider and drink
And lighting a spliff I fall into a spiral and its
Just hiding my misguiding thoughts that Im trying to kill
And Id be writing my will before Im twenty-seven
Ill die from a thrill
Go down in history as just a wasted talent
Can I face the challenge
Or did I make a mistake erasing
Its only therapy
My thoughts just get ahead of me
Eventually Ill be fine I know that it was never meant to be
Either way I guess Im not prepared
But Ill say this
These things happen for a reason and you cant change
Take my apology
Im sorry for the honesty
But I had to get this off my chest
I dont love you baby
I dont need you baby
I dont want you no
Anymore
I dont love you baby
I dont need you baby
I dont wanna love you no
AnymoreVerse one
Im not a rapper Im a singer with a flow
Ive got a habit for spitting quicker lyrics you know
Youll find me ripping the writings out of the pages they sit in
I never want to get bitten cause plagiarism is hidden
Watch how I sit on the rhythm prisoner with the vision
Signed to a label but didnt listen to any criticism
Thought you knew but you didnt so perk your ears up and listen
The studio is a system and you could say that Im driven
And now its onto the next saga we drink the best lager
Ill never try to win you over like your stepfather
Ill do my own thing now and get respect after
And Im avoiding the cane like it was Get Carter
For four years I never had a place to stay
But its safe to say that it kept me grounded like a paperweight
At sixteen years old yeah I moved out of my home
I was Macy Gray I tried to say goodbye and I choked
And went from sleeping at a subway station to
Sleeping with a movie star and adding to the population
Not my imagination I dont wanna relax
Would it hurt your reputation if I put it on wax Ill take it back now
Hook
Mmm come on and take it back love
Come on and take it back for us
Dont you fade into the back love
Oh
I take it back with the rhythm and blues with my rat pack Ill be singing the news
Tryna act like Jack Black when I bring em to school
Ill make a beat with my feet by just hitting a loop
Bringing the lyrics to prove that I can fit in these shoes
Ill give you the truth through the vocal booth
And stars burst out when they seem like an Opal Fruit
They try to take aim like Beckham when he goes to shoot
But then again thats what theyre supposed to do
And Im supposed to be calm I tattooed the lyrics onto my arm
Whispering everything that happens is from now on
Ill be ready to start again by the end of the song
And still theyre claiming that I handle it wrong
But then Ive never had an enemy except the NME
But Ill be selling twice as many copies as their magazinesll ever be
With only spectacles ahead of me and festival fees
Are healthier than a dalmatian or pedigree
Singing for the masses rubber dinghy rapids
I keep this rapping a habit and keep em fashioning magic
Im battling for respect I dont know if Ill have it
This songs from the heart covered the planet Ill take it back now
Hook
Now I dont ever wanna be perfect
Cause Im a singer that you never wanna see shirtless
And I accept the fact that someones gotta win worst-dressed
Taking my first steps into the scene giving me focus
Putting on a brave face like Timothy Dalton
Considering a name change thinking it was hopeless
Rhyming over recordings avoiding tradition
Cause every day some lyrics and a melody could be written
An absence can make your heart break but drinking Absinthe
Can change your mind state vividly need to let my liver be
And Ill say it again living life on the edge with a closed hand for the friends
Its good advice from the man who took his life on the road for me
And I hope to see him blowing up globally
Cause thats how its supposed to be Im screaming out vocally
It might seem totally impossible achieving livesteams
But but I just write schemes Im never having
A stylist giving me tight jeans
Madison Square Garden is where I might be but more likely
Youll find me in the back room of a dive bar with my mates
Having a pint of McDaids discussing records we made
And every single second knowing that well never betray
The way we were raised remembering our background sat down
Thats how we plan it out its time to take it back now
Hook 
My dreams keep me awake at night written in rhyme
Till I deliver the hype am I just living a lie
With this you must know that the numbers just sold
Will keep me going through the tough times dream with me
We forget ninety of it when we wake
But the other ten it never fades
Dreaming dreams of day-to-day goals stay awake loads
Tried to make the cut like the paper with a razor blade
Oh never give up just remember just to hold out more
A couple years ago I couldnt just control that thought
Youd find me busking on the street when it was cold outdoors
Now Im sweating on the stage of a sold-out tour
Writing love songs for the sake of it never to make a hit
You cant fake talent and work ethic just to make it quick
Im not a rapper Im a singer I just take the piss
And most of these other guys are kids that s little sister has to
Babysit thats just the way it is
Dreams are your own just set your goals and have the upmost faith in it
Tread your own path youll never make it as a follower
Youll never know where you will go or you will be tomorrow
IGHIts late in the evening
Glass on the side now
Ive been sat with you
For most of the night
Ignoring everybody here
We wish they would disappear
So maybe we could get down now
I dont wanna know
If youre getting ahead of the program
I want you to be mine lady
To hold your body close
Take another step into the no-mans land
For the longest time lady
I need you darling
Come on set the tone
If you feel youre falling
Wont you let me know oh
Oh ooh
If you love me come on get involved
Feel it rushing through you from your head to toe oh
Oh ooh
Sing oh oh
Oh oh
Louder oh oh
Sing oh oh
This love is a blaze
I saw flames from the side of the stage
And the fire brigade comes in a couple of days
Until then we got nothing to say and nothing to know
But something to drink and maybe something to smoke
Let it go until I wrote a change singing we found love in a local raid no
I dont really know what Im supposed to say
But I can just figure it out and hope and pray
I told them my name and said its nice to meet ya
Then she handed me of a bottle of water filled with tequila
I already know shes a keeper
Just from this one small act of kindness Im in deep
If anybody finds out Im meant to drive home
But Im drunk and gonna live it now no
We just sit on the couch one thing led to another now shes kissing my mouth
I need you darling
Come on set the tone
If you feel youre falling
Wont you let me know oh
Oh
If you love me come on get involved
Feel it rushing through you from your head to toe oh
Oh
Sing oh oh
Oh oh
Louder oh oh
Sing oh oh
Can you feel it
All the guys in here dont really wanna dance
Can you feel it
All that I can hear is music from the back
Can you feel it
Found you hiding here so hoped youd take my hand darling
Before the beats kicks in again
Can you feel it oh
Can you feel it oh no no no
Sing I need you darling
Come on set the tone
If you feel youre falling
Wont you let me know louder oh
Oh
Sing If you love me come on get involved
Feel it rushing through you from your head to toe louder oh
Oh
SingIts just another night
And Im staring at the moon
I saw a shooting star
And thought of you
I sang a lullaby
By the waterside and knew
If you were here
Id sing to you
Youre on the other side
As the skyline splits in two
Im miles away from seeing you
I can see the stars
From America
I wonder do you see them too
So open your eyes and see
The way our horizons meet
And all of the lights will lead
Into the night with me
And I know these scars will bleed
But both of our hearts believe
All of these stars will guide us home
I can hear your heart
On the radio beat
Theyre playing Chasing Cars
And I thought of us
Back to the time
You were lying next to me
I looked across and fell in love
So I took your hand
Back through lamp lit streets I knew
Everything led back to you
So can you see the stars
Over Amsterdam
Youre the song my heart is
Beating to
So open your eyes and see
The way our horizons meet
And all of the lights will lead
Into the night with me
And I know these scars will bleed
But both of our hearts believe
All of these stars will guide us homeWere not no were not friends nor have we ever been
We just try to keep those secrets in a lie
And if they find out will it all go wrong
And Heaven knows no one wants it to
So I could take the back road
But your eyes will lead me straight back home
And if you know me like I know you
You should love me you should know
Friends just sleep in another bed
And friends dont treat me like you do
Well I know that theres a limit to everything
But my friends wont love me like you
No my friends wont love me like you
Were not friends we could be anything
If we try to keep those secrets safe
No one will find out if it all went wrong
Theyll never know what weve been through
So I could take the back road
But your eyesll lead me straight back home
And if you know me like I know you
You should love me you should know
Friends just sleep in another bed
And friends dont treat me like you do
Well I know that theres a limit to everything
But my friends wont love me like you
No my friends wont love me like you
But then again if were not friends
Someone else might love you too
And then again if were not friends
Thered be nothing I could do and thats why
Friends should sleep in other beds
And friends shouldnt kiss me like you do
And I know that theres a limit to everything
But my friends wont love me like you
No my friends wont love me like you do
Oh my friends will never love me like youI met this girl late last year

Ive got a habit of spitting
Quicker lyrics you know
You found me ripping the writtens
Out of the pages they sit in
And never once I get bitten
Because plagiarism is hidden
Which I would sit on the rhythm
Prisoner with a vision
Signs of a label but didnt listen to any criticism
Thought you knew but you didnt
So perk your ears up and listen
Studio is a system
And you could say that Im driven
And now its on to the next saga
We drink the best lager
I never tried to win you over
Like your stepfather
I do my own thing now and get respect after
And Im avoiding cocaine like it was Get Carter
For four years I never had a place to stay
But its safe to say that it kept me grounded like a paperweight
At sixteen years old yeah I moved out of my home
I was Macy Gray I tried to say goodbye and I choked
And went from sleeping at the subway station

Would it hurt your reputation if I put it on wax
Ill take it back now
Mmmm cmon and take it back love
Cmon and take it back for us
Dont you fade into the back love
No
I take it back with the rhythm and blues
With my rap pack Ill be singing the news
Trying to act like Jack Black when I bring em to school
Ill make a beat with my feet by just hitting a loop
Bringing the lyrics to prove that I can fit in these shoes
I give you the truth through the vocal booth
Stars burst out on the scene like an opal fruit
They try and take aim like Beckham when he goes to shoot
But then again thats what theyre supposed to do
And Im supposed to be calm
I tattooed the lyrics onto my arm
Whispering everything that happens is from now on
Ill be ready to start again at the end of the song
Still their claiming that I handled it wrong
But then I never had an enemy except for NME
But Ill be selling twice as many copies as the magazines will ever be
With only spectacles ahead of me and festival fees
Im healthier than a Dalmatian on Pedigree
Singing for the masses
Rubber dinghy rapids
Keep this rapping a habit
And keep on passioning magic
Im battling for respect
I dont know if Ill have it
This songs from the heart
Cover the planet
Ill take it back now
Mmmm cmon and take it back love
Cmon and take it back for us
Dont you fade into the back love
No
Take it back now
Now I dont ever want to be perfect
Cause Im a singer that you
Never want to see shirtless
And I accept the fact that someone has to win worst-dressed
Taking my first steps into the scene
Giving me focus
Putting on a brave face like Timothy Dalton
Considering a name change
Thinking it was hopeless
Rhyming over recordings
Avoiding tradition
Cause every day some lyrics
And a melody can be written
Now absence can make your heart break
But drinking absinthe can change your mind-state vividly
I need to let my liver be
And I say it again
Living life on the edge
With a closed hand full of friends
Is good advice from a man
Who took his life on the road with me
And I hope to see him blowing up globally
Cause thats how its supposed to be
Im screaming out vocally
It might seem totally impossible
Achieving lifes dreams
But but I just write schemes
Im never having a stylist giving me tight jeans
Madison Square Garden is where I might be
But more likely
Youll find me in the back
Room of a dive bar with my mates
Having a pint with McDaid
Discussing records we made
And every single second knowing
That well never betray
The way we were raised
Remembering our background
Sat down
Thats how we plan it out
Its time to take it back now
Mmmm cmon and take it back love
Cmon and take it back for us
Dont you fade into the back love
No
Mmmm cmon and take it back love
Cmon and take it back for us
Dont you fade into the back love
NoYou look so wonderful in your dress
I love your hair like that
The way it falls on the side of your neck
Down your shoulders and back
We are surrounded by all of these lies
And people who talk too much
Youve got that kind of look in your eyes
As if no one knows anything but us
And should this be the last thing I see
I want you to know its enough for me
Cause all that you are is all that Ill ever need
Im so in love so in love
So in love so in love
You look so beautiful in this light
Your silhouette over me
The way it brings out the blue in your eyes
Is the Tenerife sea
And all of the voices surrounding us here
They just fade out when you take a breath
Just say the word and I will disappear
Into the wilderness
And should this be the last thing I see
I want you to know its enough for me
Cause all that you are is all that Ill ever need
Im so in love so in love
So in love so in love
Lumiere darling
Lumiere over me
Lumiere darling
Lumiere over me
Lumiere darling
Lumiere over me
And should this be the last thing I see
I want you to know its enough for me
Cause all that you are is all that Ill ever need
Im so in love so in love
So in love love love love
So in love
You look so wonderful in your dress
I loved your hair like that
And in the moment I knew you BethNow Im in town break it down thinking of making a new sound
Playing a different show every night in front of a new crowd
Thats you now ciao seems that life is great now
See me lose focus as I sing to you loud
And I cant no I wont hush
Ill say the words that make you blush
Im gonna sing this now
See Im true my songs are where my heart is
Im like glue I stick to other artists
Im not you now that would be disastrous
Let me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures
See Im real I do it all its all me
Im not fake dont ever call me lazy
I wont stay put give me the chance to be free
Suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me
Cause you need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you at all
You need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you at all
You need me
I sing and write my own tune
And I write my own verso
Dont need another word-smith to make my tune sell
Call yourself a singer-writer Youre just bluffing
Your names on the credits and you didnt write nothing
I sing fast I know that all my shits cool
I will blast and I didnt go to Brit School
I came fast with the way I act right
I cant last if Im smoking on a crack pipe
And I wont be a product of my genre
My mind will always be stronger than my songs are
Never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya
Always read the stories that you hear on Wikipedia
And musically Im demonstrating
When I perform live feels like I am meditating
Times at the Enterprise when some fella filmed me
A young singer-writer like Gabriella Cilmi
Cause you need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you at all
You need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you at all
You need me
Cause with the lyrics Ill be aiming it right
I wont stop till my names in light
At Stadium Heights with Damien Rice
On red carpets now Im on arabian nights
Because Im young and all my brothers gonna give me advice
Long nighter short height and Im gone hyper
Never be anything but a singer-songwriter
The games over but now Im on a new level
Watch how I step on the track without a loop pedal
People think that Im bound to blow up
Ive done around about a thousand shows
But I havent got a house plus I live on the couch
So you can be the lyrics when Im singing them out wow
From day one Ive been prepared
With Vfive wax for my ginger hair
So now Im back to the sofa giving a dose of what the future holds
Cause its another day plus Ill keep my last name forever keep the genre pretty basic
Gonna be breaking into other peoples tunes when I chase it
And replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift
Into another rappers shoes using new laces
Selling cds from my rucksack aiming for the papers
Selling cds from my rucksack aiming for majors
Nationwide til were just jack soon as I get the bus back
Clean cut kid without a razor for the mustache
I hit back when the pen hurts me
Im still a choir boy in a French church tee
Im still the same as a year ago
But more people hear me though
According to the myspace and youtube videos
Im always doing shows if Im not Im in the studio
Truly broke never growing up call me Ruffio
Melody music maker
Reading all the papers
They say Im up and coming like Im fucking in an elevator
Cause you need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you at all
You need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you at all
You need me man I dont need youWell I walked from my house to yours
In a warm cold April rain
We barely went outdoors
And your family took the blame
Take time to be with you
She can only glare
Im a bad influence
Thatll do cause I need to cut my hair
Wash my mouth
Change my clothes
Just dont talk those friends of yours
Tell them not to come here anymore
Time to go dont be slow
Thisll only take a mo
Take yourself right off my door
Its just that they dont care
Dad said Beware watch your back
And just dont reply to the woman there
Even if she makes a fuss just ignore that trust
And Dont give into lust
And Leave that one alone the girls a trouble
Time spent in burnt-down shed
Add up near two days
Fall down and cut my head
Take time to misbehave
Spend time and be with you
She can only glare cause
Youre a bad influence
Thatll do boy you need to cut your hair
Wash my mouth
Change my clothes
Just dont talk those friends of yours
Tell them not to come here anymore
Time to go dont be slow
Thisll only take a mo
Take yourself right off my door
Its just that they dont care
Dad said Beware watch your back
And just dont reply to the woman there
Even if she makes a fuss just ignore that trust
And Dont give into lust
And Leave that one alone the girls a trouble
This is the dancing song
Close your eyes
Hypnotise to the beat
And the movement of the week
Do that shuffle of your feet
And pound out the fever
Either dance cause youre a true believer
Cleaner lives are what you dont see
Feel the weight
Gravitate
Feel the pace of me
This world is twoD
The only thing thats free in life is love
And that dont come cheap
Its just that they dont care
Dad said Beware watch your back
And just dont reply to the woman there
Even if she makes a fuss just ignore that trust
And Dont give into lust
And Leave that one alone the girls a troubleOh misty eye of the mountain below
Keep careful watch of my brothers souls
And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke
Keep watching over Durins son
If this is to end in fire
Then we should all burn together
Watch the flames climb high into the night
Calling out for the rope sent by and we will
Watch the flames burn on and on the mountain side hey
And if we should die tonight
Then we should all die together
Raise a glass of wine for the last time
Calling out for the rope
Prepare as we will
Watch the flames burn on and on the mountain side
Desolation comes upon the sky
Now I see fire inside the mountain
I see fire burning the trees
And I see fire hollowing souls
And I see fire blood in the breeze
And I hope that youll remember me
Oh should my people fall
Then surely Ill do the same
Confined in mountain halls
We got too close to the flame
Calling out father hold fast and we will
Watch the flames burn on and on the mountain side
Desolation comes upon the sky
Now I see fire inside the mountain
I see fire burning the trees
And I see fire hollowing souls
And I see fire blood in the breeze
And I hope that youll remember me
And if the night is burning
I will cover my eyes
For if the dark returns then
My brothers will die
And as the skys falling down
It crashed into this lonely town
And with that shadow upon the ground
I hear my people screaming out
Now I see fire inside the mountain
I see fire burning the trees
And I see fire hollowing souls
And I see fire blood in the breeze
I see fire oh you know I saw a city burning fire
And I see fire feel the heat upon my skin fire
And I see fire fire
And I see fire burn on and on and mountains sideLoving can hurt loving can hurt sometimes
But its the only thing that I know
When it gets hard you know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive
We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts are never broken
And times forever frozen still
So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me closer til our eyes meet
You wont ever be alone wait for me to come home
Loving can heal loving can mend your soul
And its the only thing that I know know
I swear it will get easier
Remember that with every piece of you
Hm and its the only thing we take with us when we die
Hm we keep this love in this photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts were never broken
And times forever frozen still
So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me closer til our eyes meet
You wont ever be alone
And if you hurt me
Thats okay baby only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I wont ever let you go
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
You can fit me
Inside the necklace you got when you were sixteen
Next to your heartbeat where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul
And if you hurt me
Well thats okay baby only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I wont ever let you go
When Im away I will remember how you kissed me
Under the lamppost back on Sixth street
Hearing you whisper through the phone
Wait for me to come homeIve been spinning out for time
Couple women by my side
I got sinnin on my mind
Sipping on red wine
Ive been sitting here for ages
Ripping out pages
Howd I get so faded
Howd I get so faded
Oh
No no dont leave me lonely now
If you love me how
You never loved me
Ooh
Color crimson in my eyes
Wanted to could free my mind
This is how it ends
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
Fading out again
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
So tell me when it kicks in
Well tell when it kicks in
Ive been looking for a love
Thought Id find it really boring
God make me another one
Ill be feeling this tomorrow
Lord forgive me for the things Ive done
I was never meant to hurt no one
And I saw scars upon her broken hearted dove
Oh
No no dont leave me lonely now
If you love me how
You never loved me
Ooh
Color crimson in my eyes
Wanted to could free my mind
This is how it ends
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
Fading out again

Even my dad does sometimes
So dont wipe your eyes
Tears remind you youre alive
Its alright to die
Cause deaths the only thing you havent tried
But just for tonight hold on
So live life like youre giving up
Cause you act like you are
Go ahead and just live it up
Go on and tear me apart
Its alright to shake
Even my hand does sometimes
So inside the rage
Against the dying of the light
Its alright to say that deaths the only thing you havent tried
But just for today hold on
So live life like youre giving up
Cause you act like you are
Go ahead and just live it up
Go on and tear me apart hold onTell me that you turned down the man
Who asked for your hand
Cause youre waiting for me
And I know youre gonna be away a while
But Ive got no plans at all to leave
And would you take away my hopes and dreams
Just stay with me
All my senses come to life
While Im stumbling home as drunk as I
Have ever been and Ill never leave again
Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me youll never leave again
Cause you are the only one
Take my hand and my
Heart and soul I will
Only have these eyes for you
And you know everything changes but
Well be strangers if we see this through
You could stay within these walls and bleed
But just stay with me
All my senses come to life
While Im stumbling home as drunk as I
Have ever been and Ill never leave again
Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me youll always be a friend
Cause you are the only one
Im stumbling off drunk getting myself lost
I am so gone so tell me the way home
I listen to sad songs singing about love
And where it goes wrong
All my senses come to life
While Im stumbling home as drunk as I
Have ever been and Ill never leave again
Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me youll always be a friend
Cause you are the only oneWhen the sins of my father
Weigh down in my soul
And the pain of my mother
Will not let me go
Well I know there can come fire from the sky
To refine the purest of kings
And even though
I know this fire brings me pain
Even so
And just the same
Make it rain
Make it rain down low
Make it rain
Oh make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain down low
Make it rain
Make it rain
The seed needs the water
Before it grows out of the ground
But it just keeps on getting hard
And the hunger more profound
Well I know there can come tears from the eye
But they may as well be in vain
Even though
I know these tears come with pain
Even so
And just the same
Make it rain
Make it rain down low
Make it rain
Oh make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain down low
Make it rain
Make it rain
And the seas are full of water
That stops by the shore
Just like the riches of grandeur oh no no
Never reach the port
So let the clouds fill with thunderous applause
And let lightning be the veins
That fill the sky
With all that they can drop
When its time to make a change
Make it rain
Make it rain down low
Make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain down low
Make it rain
Oh make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain
Oh make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain down low
Make it rain

And the fire brigade comes in a couple of days
Until then we got nothing to say and nothing to know
But something to drink and maybe something to smoke
Let it go until I wrote a change singing we found love in a local raid no
I dont really know what Im supposed to say
But I can just figure it out and hope and pray
I told them my name and said its nice to meet ya
Then she handed me of a bottle of water filled with tequila
I already know shes a keeper
Just from this one small act of kindness Im in deep
If anybody finds out Im meant to drive home
But Im drunk and gonna live it now no

Half the guys I know are after you
Cheer me up when Im in a mood
So I thought Id write a song for you
And may I say you look like an angel today
May I say take me to the place where your mind lays
If only to make you smile today
Cos you are great I thought Id say that
Sara reminds me of drunken talks in a hammock
Behind a can of Strongbow
Oh wow I said
Sara you say that you dont look good when you do
Even with that soul
Your hair is blonde your eyes are blue
Half the guys I know are after you
Cheer me up when Im in a mood
So I thought Id write a song for you
And may I say you look like an angel today
May I say take me to the place where your mind lays
If only to make you smile today

Going the wrong way home

Pressure

Lets just go back to the way it was
When we were on
Honeymoon Avenue
Honeymoon Avenue
Honeymoon Avenue

Caught my attention
Ive never seen
A man with so much dimension
Its the way you walk
The way you talk
The way you make me feel inside
Its in your smile
Its in your eyes
I dont wanna wait for tonight
Chorus
So Im daydreaming
With my chin in the palm of my hands
About you

Put your hand up stand up tell me how you really felt
Then maybe itd be different

of our story
The future seemed so bright
Then this thing turned out
So evil
I dont know why Im still surprised
Even angels have
Their wicked schemes
And you take that
To new extremes
But youll always be my hero
Even though youve lost your mind
Just gonna stand there
And watch me burn
But thats alright
Because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there
And hear me cry
But thats alright because
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie ohh
I love the way you lie
Now theres gravel
In our voices
Glass is shattered
From the fight
In this tug of war
Youll always win
Even when Im right
Cause you feed me fables
From your hand
With violent words
And empty threats
And its sick that
All these battles
Are what keeps me satisfied
Just gonna stand there
And watch me burn
But thats alright
Because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there
And hear me cry
But thats alright because
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie ohh
I love the way you lie
So maybe Im
A masochist
I try to run
But I dont ever wanna leave
Til these walls
Are going up
In smoke with
All our memories
Just gonna stand there
And watch me burn
But thats alright
Because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there
And here me cry
But thats alright because
I love the way you lie
I love the the way you lie ohh
I love the way you liemmh ohh ohh
Alright yeah yeah mhhh

Cause the truth hurts so much more
Would you do the things that drive me crazy
Leave my heart still at the door

If i could just die in your arms
I wouldnt mind cause everytime you touch me
I just die in your arms
Oh it feels so right
So baby baby please dont stop boy
You know this aint the first time
This has happened to me this love sick thing
I like serious relationships
And a girl like me dont stay single for long
Cause every time a boyfriend and I break up
My world is crushed and Im all alone
The love bug crawls right back up
And bites me and Im back
Ohhh if there is a reason to call me a fool
Cause I love too hard are there any rules baby
If this is a lesson then baby teach me to behave
Just tell me what I gotta do just to stay right next to you

To get the hell away from those who block my vision
You used me as a fragment of your grand design hey
And you you dont get to put me on your bottom line
You dont get whats mine and Im doing fine
Said you dont want to see the girl I want to be
Then why then why would I listen
You dont want to do the things I need from you
Goodbye goodbye

Person of the week in every Greek opinion poll
What a pro Herc could stop a show
Point him at a monster and we are talking SRO
He was a no one
A zero zero
Now hes a honcho
Hes a hero
He was a kid with his act down pat
From zero to hero in no time flat
Zero to hero just like that
When he smiled the girls went wild
With oohs and ahhs
And they slapped his face on evry vase
On every vase
From heroes fees and royalties
Our Herc had cash to burn
Now Nouveau Riche and famous
He could tell you
Whats a Grecian urn
Say amen and there he goes again
Sweet and undefeated
And an awesome ten for ten
Folks lined up
Just to watch him flex
And his perfect package
In a a pair of pretty pecs
Hercie he comes he sees he conquers
Honey the crowds were going bonkers
He showed the moxie brains and spunk
From zero to hero a major hunk
From zero to hero and whoda thunk
Who put the glad in gladiator Hercules
Whose daring deeds are great theatre Hercules
Isnt he bold No one braver
Isnt he sweet Our favorite flavor
Hercules Hercules Hercules
Hercules Hercules
Hercules Hercules
Bless my soul Herc was on a roll
Undefeated
Riding high and the nicest guy
Not conceited
He was a nothing
A zero zero
Now hes a honcho
Hes a hero
He hit the heights a breakneck speed
From zero to hero
Herc is a hero
Now hes a hero
Yes indeedCome and kiss me baby

I could see you both
In a lovers silhouette
And my heart stood still
I was froze right there
Staring down at her red dress
So I bolted out the door
Jumped right into the car
Its too dangerous
To be in the vicinity of where you are
Rolled down all the windows
Just so I could breathe
I cant believe you just actually did this shit to me
Im going bout a hundred
Mascara running
Laughing out of anger
But it dont strike me as funny
Been too good to you
Ive been virtuous and true
To have something like this
Happen in my own bedroomI know what I came to do
And that aint gonna change
So go ahead and talk your talk
Cause I wont take the bait
Im over here doing what I like
Im over here working day and night
And if my real aint real enough
Im sorry for you bae
Lets find a light inside our universe now
Where aint nobody keep on holding us down
Just come and get it let them say what they say
Cause Im about to put them all away
Focus on me

Focus on me Focus
Focus on me Focus on me
Focus on me Focus

Aint no need to hold it back
Go head and talk your shit
I know youre hoping that Ill react
I know youre hoping Im looking back
But if my real aint real enough
Then I dont know what is
Lets find a light inside our universe now

Feeling Christmas all around
And Im trying to play it cool
But its hard to focus when I see you walking around the room
Let it snow its blasting now
But I wont get in the mood
Im avoiding every mistletoe until I know
Its true love that he thinks of
So next Christmas

Santa tell me if youre really there
Dont make me fall in love again if he wont be here
Next year
Santa tell me if he really cares
Cause I cant give it all away if he wont be here
Next year
Ive been down this road before
Fell in love on Christmas night
But on New Years Day I woke up and he wasnt by my side
Now I need someone to hold
Be my fire in the cold
But its hard to tell if this is just a fling
Or if its true love that he thinks of
So next Christmas
Im not all alone babe
Santa tell me if youre really there
Dont make me fall in love again if he wont be here
Next year
Santa tell me if he really cares
Cause I cant give it all away if he wont be here

But I dont want no broken heart
This year Ive got to be smart

Dealing with emotions that never left
Playing with the hand that we were dealt in this game
Maybe Im the sinner and youre the saint
Gotta stop pretending what we aint
Why we pointing fingers anyway
When were the same
Break up
Make up
Total waste of time
Can we please make up our minds
And stop acting like were blind
Cause if the water dries up and the moon stops shining
Stars fall and the world goes blind boy
You know Ill be savin my love for you for you
Cause youre the best mistake Ive ever made
But we hold on hold on
Theres no pot of gold in the rainbows we chase
But we hold on hold on
I guess times wasting tick tocking lip locking
How can we keep the feelings fresh how do we zip lock it
Wear your heart up on your sleeves so watch out for pickpockets
I guess to go the distance we might need to pit stop it
Hold up I know love could be a beach with no shore
I done count to ten lost my temper and went back to four
I know sometimes its hard to realize Im the man that you need
I had a dream we branched out started a family tree
And I feel like that everything we do is overdue
You ask why I love your mom so much cause shes a older you
I wish that you were happy I guess thats the one thing I should be providing
Aint no number twos we both ones of ones and we the oddest
Couple only humans cept you you a goddess
Only lying to you when I lie you down just being honest
When you start as friends its hard to say youre never going back
If Im not the one then Im the best mistake you ever had
Break up
Make up
Total waste of time
Can we please make up our minds
And stop acting like were blind
Cause if the water dries up and the moon stops shining
Stars fall and the world goes blind boy
You know Ill be savin my love for you for you
Cause youre the best mistake Ive ever made
But we hold on hold on
Theres no pot of gold in the rainbows we chase
But we hold on hold on

Ariana Grande - Grenade Lyrics
If you know how to be my lover
Maybe you can be my baby
Hold me close under the covers
Kiss me boy and drive me crazy
Be my be my be my
Be my be my baby

Baby and drive me crazy
If you know how to treat me
You know how to touch me
Baby then youll get the chance
The chance to love me
Its obvious I want to be into you
But it all depends on all the things you do
Cause babe I promise I promise
If you keep it real with me
Be honest be honest
You can get anything you want

Hold me close under the covers
Kiss me boy and drive me crazy

So if you treat me right just the way that I want you
Oh baby boy I promise that Ill be on you

Baby and drive me crazyI dont ever ask you where youve been
And I dont feel the need to
Know who youre with
I cant even think straight but I can tell
You were just with her
And Ill still be a fool Im a fool for you
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart is all I want
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit is all Im asking for
I dont ever tell you how I really feel
Cause I cant find the words to say what I mean
And nothings ever easy
Thats what they say
I know Im not your only
But Ill still be a fool
Cause Im a fool for you
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart is all I want
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit is all Im asking for
I know Im not youre only
But at least Im one
I heard a little love is better than none
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart is all I want
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit is all Im asking for
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart is all I want
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit is all Im asking forDear Santa

And its been kinda tough cause
Hes only in town for the holidays
Tomorrow hes flying away
Away from me
I dont need another gift

Dont want him to go tomorrow morning
Give me something to make him stay
Wrapped in his arms by the fireplace
Will be the perfect gift
Let it snow let it snow let it snow

In Calif-orn-i-a
Dear Santa

I checked the news and it said

For a couple more days

Wont you find a way
I dont need another gift

Dont want him to go tomorrow morning
Give me something to make him stay
Wrapped in his arms by the fireplace
Will be the perfect gift
Let it snow let it snow let it snow

I know Im asking for the impossible
But I believe in miracles
I need my baby right here with me
So please please
Just make it snow in California
Ill even settle for rain
Dont want him to go tomorrow morning
Give me something to make him stay
Wrapped in his arms by the fireplace
Will be the perfect gift
Let it snow let it snow let it snow

In Calif-orn-i-a
Ill even settle for rainSometimes I think were the brightest stars
And I try to believe well find a way
Will life change when our hearts turn colder Major Lazer
All the rhythms in my heart lift me up inside
We cant stay out of trouble is it worth the blame
Is it true that the more you give the more they take
All the rhythms in my heart lift me up and say

All my love I know theyll let it find us
All my loves up on the mountain tops

And then it was clear
I cant deny
I really missed him
To think that I was wrong
I guess you dont know what you got til its gone
Pain is just a consequence of love
Im saying sorry for the sake of us
He wasnt my everything til we were nothing
And its taken me a lot to say
And now that hes gone my heart is missing something
So its time to push my pride away
Cause you are you are you are my everything
You are you are you are my everything
I know youre not far but I still cant handle all the distance
Youre traveling with my heart
I hope this is a temporary feeling
Cause its too much to bear without you
When I lose sight aint lookin
If I go tomorrow just know Im yours
Cause what we got is worth fighting for
Cause you were you were my everything til we were nothing
And its taken me a lot to say
And now that youre gone my heart is missing something
So its time to push my pride away
You are you are you are my everything
You are you are you are my everything
You are you are you are my everythingI dont ever ask you where youve been
And I dont feel the need to
Know who youre with
I cant even think straight but I can tell
You were just with her
And Ill still be a fool Im a fool for you
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart is all I want
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit is all Im asking for
I dont ever tell you how I really feel
Cause I cant find the words to say what I mean
And nothings ever easy
Thats what they say
I know Im not your only
But Ill still be a fool
Cause Im a fool for you
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart is all I want
Just a little bit of your heart

And I know and I know and I know
She gives you everything but boy I couldnt give it to you

So one last time
I need to be the one who takes you home
One more time
I promise after that Ill let you go
Baby I dont care if you got her in your heart
All I really care is you wake up in my arms
One last time
I need to be the one who takes you home
I dont deserve it
I know I dont deserve it
But stay with me a minute
Ill swear Ill make it worth it
Cant you forgive me
At least just temporarily
I know that this is my fault
I should have been more careful come on
And I know and I know and I know
She gives you everything but boy I couldnt give it to you
And I know and I know and I know
That you got everything
But I got nothing here without you baby
So one last time
I need to be the one who takes you home
One more time
I promise after that Ill let you go
Baby I dont care if you got her in your heart
All I really care is you wake up in my arms
One last time

Baby I dont care if you got her in your heart
All I really care is you wake up in my arms
One last time
I need to be the one who takes you home
One last time
I need to be the one who takes you homeI let it fall my heart
And as it fell you rose to claim it
It was dark and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me
My hands theyre strong
But my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet
But theres a side to you
That I never knew never knew
All the things youd say
They were never true never true
And the games you play
You would always win always win
But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well it burned while I cried
Cause I heard it screaming Out your name
Your name
When I lay with you
I could stay there
Close my eyes
Feel you here forever
You and me together nothing gets better
Cause theres a side to you
That I never knew never knew
All the things youd say
They were never true never true
And the games you play
You would always win always win
But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well it burned while I cried
Cause I heard it screaming out your name
Your name
I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
Well it felt something died
Cause I knew that that was
The last time the last time
Sometimes I wake up by the door
That heart you caught must be waiting for you
Even now when were already over
I cant help myself from looking for you
I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well it burned while I cried
Cause I heard it screaming Out your name
Your name
I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
Well it felt something died
Cause I knew that that was the last time
The last time
Let it burn
Let it burn
Let it burnFool that I am for falling in love with you
And fool that I am for thinking you loved me too
You took my heart then played the part of little coquette
And my dreams just disappeared like the smoke from a cigarette
Fool that I am for hoping youd understand
And thinking you would listen to all of the things
The things I had planned
But we couldnt see eye to eye
So darling
Darling
Darling this is goodbyeI want to see your face in every kind of light
In fields of dawn and forests of the night
And when you stand before the candles on a cake
Oh let me be the one to hear the silent wish you make
What are you doing the rest of your life
North and South and East and West of your life
I have only one request of your life
That you spend it all with me
All the seasons and the times of your days
All the nickels and the dimes of your days
Let the reasons and the rhymes of your days
All begin and end with me
I want to see your face in every kind of light
In the fields of dawn and the forests of the night
And when you stand before the candles on a cake
Oh let me be the one to hear the silent wish you make
Those tomorrows waiting deep in your eyes
In the world of love that you keep in your eyes
Ill awaken whats asleep in your eyes
It may take a kiss or two
Through all of my life
Summer Winter Spring and Fall of my life
All I ever will recall of my life
Is all of my life with youThis is the end

And as it fell you rose to claim it

Until you kissed my lips and you saved me
My hands theyre strong
But my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet
But theres a side to you
That I never knew never knew
All the things youd say
They were never true never true
And the games you play
You would always win always win

I could stay there
Close my eyes

You and me together nothing gets better

Well it felt something died
Cause I knew that that was the last time
The last time
Let it burn
Let it burn
Let it burnTurn down the lights
Turn down the bed
Turn down these voices
Inside my head
Lay down with me
And tell me no lies
Just hold me closly
Dont patronize
Dont patronize me
Cause I cant make you love me
If you dont
You cant make your heart feel
Something that it wont
And even in the dark
These final hours
I will lay down my heart
I will feel the power
But you wont
No you wont
Cause I cant make you love me
When you dont
When you dont yeah
Ill close my eyes
Cause then I dont see
The love you dont feel
When youre holding me
Morning will come
And Ill do whats right
Just give me till then
To give up this fight
And I will give up this fight
Cause I cant make you love me
If you dont
You cant make your heart feel
Something that it wont
And even in the dark
These final hours
I will lay down my heart
I will feel the power
But you wont
No you wont
Cause I cant make you love me
When you dont
When you dont ooh dont
You when you dont yeah yeahWhen will I see you again
You left with no goodbye not a single word was said
No final kiss to seal anything
And I had no idea of the state we were in
I know I have a fickle heart and a bitterness
And a wandering eye and a heaviness in my head
But dont you remember dont you remember
The reason you loved me before
Baby please remember me once more
When was the last time you thought of me
Or have you completely erased me from your memories
Cause I often think about where I went wrong
And the more I do the less I know
But I know I have a fickle heart and a bitterness
And a wandering eye and a heaviness in my head
But dont you remember dont you remember
The reason you loved me before
Baby please remember me once more
Oh I gave you the space so you could breathe
And I kept my distance so you would be free
And hope that you find the missing piece
To bring you back to me
Why dont you remember dont you remember
The reason you loved me before
Baby please remember that you used to love me
When will I see you againI thought I told you hed be home soon
Couldnt help myself youre too good to be true
I fall short each time
Every time he aint here
You and your charm creep closer
Closer and near
Like a fool for fire I fall with my pride and all
Like a bomb before explosion
Ticking by your call
Youre the wiser one disguised from greed
And Im just a child who belongs on her knees
But I found a boy who I love more
Than I ever did you before
So stand beside the river I cried
And lay yourself down
Look how you want me now that I dont need you
So you thought that Id crumble to my knees
At the first sight of you crawling back to me
To whisper will you leave your man
Cause you swear that this time you can stand by me
I wont stand by you
Cause I found a boy who I love more
Than I ever did you before
So stand beside the river I cried
And lay yourself down
Look how you want me now that I dont need you
I aint yours for no taking
You must be mistaken
I could never look into your eyes and settle for wrong
And ignore the right
When I found a boy who loves me more
Than you ever did me before
So stand beside the river you cried
And lay yourself down
Look how you want me now that I dont need youHold me closer one more time
Say that you love me in your last goodbye
Please forgive me for my sins
Yes I swam dirty waters
But you pushed me in
Ive seen your face under every sky
Over every border and on every line
You know my heart more than I do
We were the greatest me and you
But we had time against us
And miles between us
The heavens cried
I know I left you speechless
But now the sky has cleared and its blue
And I see my future in you
Ill be waiting for you when youre ready to love me again
Ill put my hands up
Ill do everything different
Ill be better to you
Ill be waiting for you when youre ready to love me again
Ill put my hands up
Ill be somebody different
Ill be better to you
Let me stay here for just one more night
Build your world around me
And pull me to the light
So I can tell you that I was wrong
I was a child then but now Im willing to learn
But we had time against us
And miles between us
The heavens cried
I know I left you speechless
But now the sky has cleared and its blue
And I see my future in you
Ill be waiting for you when youre ready to love me again
Ill put my hands up
Ill do everything different
Ill be better to you
Ill be waiting for you when youre ready to love me again
Ill put my hands up
Ill be somebody different
Ill be better to you
Time against us
Miles between us
Heavens cried
I know I left you speechless
Time against us

Finally I can see you crystal clear
Go head and sell me out and Ill lay your ship bare
See how Ill leave with every piece of you
Dont underestimate the things that I will do
Theres a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and its bringing me out the dark
The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinkin that we almost had it all
The scars of your love they leave me breathless
I cant help feeling we couldve had it all Youre gonna wish you never met me
Rolling in the deep Tears are gonna fall rollin in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand Youre gonna wish you never met me
And you played it to the beat Tears are gonna fall rollin in the deep
Baby I have no story to be told
But Ive heard one on you and Im gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Making a home down there as mine sure wont be shared
The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinkin that we almost had it all
The scars of your love they leave me breathless
I cant help feeling we couldve had it all
Rolling in the deep you had my heart inside of your hand
And you played it to the beat
Couldve had it all Rollin in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
But you played it with a beating
Throw your stone through every open door
Count your blessings to find what you look for
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold
You pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow
We couldve had it all We couldve had it all
It all It all It all We couldve had it all
Rollin in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
And you played it to the beat

Rollin in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
But you played it you played it you played it you played it to the beatI never woulda hitch-hiked to Birmingham
If it hadnt been for love
I never woulda caught the train to Louisiana
If it hadnt been for love
I never woulda run through the blindin rain
Without one dollar to my name
If it hadnt been if it hadnt been for love
I never woulda seen the trouble that Im in
If it hadnt been for love
Woulda been gone like a wayward wind
If it hadnt been for love
Nobody knows it better than me
I wouldnt be wishing I was free
If it hadnt been if it hadnt been for love
Four cold walls against my will
At least I know hes lying still
Four cold walls without parole
Lord have mercy on my soul
Four cold walls against my will
At least I know hes lying still
Four cold walls without parole
Lord have mercy on my soulYouve been on my mind
I grow fonder every day
Lose myself in time
Just thinking of your face
God only knows why its taken me
So long to let my doubts go
Youre the only one that I want
I dont know why Im scared

Every feeling every word

Youll never know if you never try
To forget your past and simply be mine
I dare you to let me be your your one and only
I promise Im worthy
To hold in your arms
So come on and give me the chance
To prove I am the one who can walk that mile
Until the end starts
If Ive been on your mind
You hang on every word I say
Lose yourself in time
At the mention of my name
Will I ever know how it feels to hold you close
And have you tell me
Whichever road I choose youll go
I dont know why Im scared
Cause Ive been here before
Every feeling every word
Ive imagined it all
Youll never know if you never try
To forget your past and simply be mine
I dare you to let me be your your one and only
I promise Im worthy mm

Until the end startsSome say Ill be better without you
They dont know you like I do
Or at least as far as I thought I knew
I cant bear this time
It drags as I lose my mind
Reminded by things I find
I know some clothes you left behind
Wake me up wake me up when all is done
I wont rise until this battles won
My dignity is become undone
But I wont go
I cant do it on my own
If this aint love then what is
Im willing to take the risk
I wont go I cant do it on my own
If this is aint love then what is
Im willing to take the risk
So petrified Im so scared to step into this right
What if I lose my heart and fail the
I wont forgive me if I gave up trying
I heard his voice today
I didnt know a single word he said
Now Im resemblance to the man I met
Just a vague and broken boy instead
But I wont go I cant do it on my own
If this aint love then what is
Im willing to take the risk
I wont go I cant do it on my own
If this aint love then what is
Im willing to take the risk
There will be times well try and give it up
Bursting at the seams no doubt
We almost fall apart and burn up easy
So watch them turn to dust
But nothing will never taint us
I wont go I cant do it on my own
If this aint love then what is
Im willing to take the risk
I wont go I cant do it on my own
If this aint love then what is
Im willing to take the risk
Will he will he still remember me
Will he still love me even when hes free
Or will he go back to the place where
He will choose the poison over me
When we spoke yesterday
He said to hold my breath to sit and wait
Ill be home soon I wont be late
He wont go
He cant do it on his own
If this aint love then what is
Hes willing to take the risk
So I wont go I cant do it on his own
If this aint love then what is
Im willing to take the risk
Cause he wont go
He cant do it on his own
If this aint love then what is
Were willing to take the risk
I wont go I cant do it on my own
If this aint love then what is
Im willing to take the riskThis is how the story went
I met someone by accident
It blew me away
Blew me away
It was in the darkest of my days
When you took my sorrow and you took my pain
And buried them away you buried them away
I wish I could lay down beside you
When the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything Ive ever known
You disappear one day
So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away
Dropped you off at the train station
Put a kiss on top of your head
Watch you wave
And watched you wave
Then I went on home to my skyscrapers
And neon lights and waiting papers
That I call home
I call that home
I wish I could lay down beside you
When the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything Ive ever known
You disappear one day
So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away away
Woke up feeling heavy-hearted
Im going back to where I started
The morning rain the morning rain
And though I wish that you were here
On that same old road that brought me here
Its calling me home Its calling me home
I wish I could lay down beside you
When the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything Ive ever known
You disappear one day
So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away
I cant spend my whole life hiding my heart awayI heard that youre settled down
That you found a girl and youre married now
I heard that your dreams came true
Guess she gave you things I didnt give to you
Old friend why are you so shy
Aint like you to hold back or hide from the light
I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited
But I couldnt stay away I couldnt fight it
I had hoped youd see my face and that youd be reminded
That for me it isnt over
Never mind Ill find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you two
Dont forget me I beg I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead
You know how the time flies
Only yesterday was the time of our lives
We were born and raised in a summer haze
Bound by the surprise of our glory days
I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited
But I couldnt stay away I couldnt fight it
I had hoped youd see my face and that youd be reminded
That for me it isnt over
Never mind Ill find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you two
Dont forget me I beg I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead yeah
Nothing compares no worries or cares
Regrets and mistakes theyre memories made
Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste
Never mind Ill find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you
Dont forget me I beg I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead
Never mind Ill find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you two
Dont forget me I beg I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts insteadIm insane in the brain

You played it to the beatClose enough to start a war
All that I have is on the floor
God only knows what were fighting for
All that I say you always say more
I cant keep up with your turning tables
Under your thumb I cant breathe
So I wont let you close enough to hurt me
No I wont ask you you to just desert me
I cant give you what you think you gave me
Its time to say goodbye to turning tables to turning tables
Under haunted skies I see
Where love is lost your ghost is found
Ive braved a hundred storms to leave you
As hard as you try no I will never be knocked down
I cant keep up with your turning tables
Under your thumb I cant breathe
So I wont let you close enough to hurt me no
I wont ask you you to just desert me
I cant give you what you think you gave me
Its time to say goodbye to turning tables turning tables
Next time Ill be braver Ill be my own savior
When the thunder calls to me
Next time Ill be braver Ill be my own savior
Standing on my own two feet
I wont let you close enough to hurt me no
I wont ask you you to just desert me
I cant give you what you think you gave me
Its time to say goodbye to turning tables to turning tables

But rumor has it hes the one Im leaving you forEverybody loves the things you do
From the way you talk
To the way you move
Everybody here is watching you
Cause you feel like home
Youre like a dream come true
But if by chance youre here alone
Can I have a moment
Before I go
Cause Ive been by myself all night long
Hoping youre someone I used to know
You look like a movie
You sound like a song
My God this reminds me
Of when we were young
Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were
Before we realized
We were sad of getting old
It made us restless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
I was so scared to face my fears
Nobody told me that youd be here
And I swore you moved overseas
Thats what you said when you left me
You still look like a movie
You still sound like a song
My God this reminds me
Of when we were young
Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were
Before we realized
We were sad of getting old
It made us restless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
When we were young
When we were young
When we were young
When we were young
Its hard to win me back
Everything just takes me back
To when you were there
To when you were there
And a part of me keeps holding on
Just in case it hasnt gone
I guess I still care
Do you still care
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
My God this reminds me
Of when we were young
When we were young
When we were young
When we were young
When we were young
Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were
Before we realized
We were sad of getting old
It made us restless
Oh Im so mad Im getting old
It makes me reckless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
When we were youngEverybody tells me its bout time that I moved on
And I need to learn to lighten up and learn how to be young
But my heart is a valley its so shallow and man made
Im scared to death if I let you in that youll see Im just a fake
Sometimes I feel lonely in the arms of your touch
But I know thats just me cause nothing ever is enough
When I was a child I grew up by the River Lea
There was something in the water now that somethings in me
Oh I cant go back but the reeds are growing out of my fingertips
I cant go back to the river
But its in my roots its in my veins
Its in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain
But its in my roots its in my veins
Its in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain
So I blame it on the River Lea the River Lea the River Lea
Yeah I blame it on the River Lea the River Lea the River Lea
I should probably tell you now before its way too late
That I never meant to hurt you or lie straight to your face
Consider this my apology I know its years in advance
But Id rather say it now in case I never get the chance
No I cant go back but the reeds are growing out of my fingertips
I cant go back to the river
But its in my roots its in my veins
Its in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain
Its in my roots its in my veins
Its in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain
So I blame it on the River Lea the River Lea the River Lea
Yeah I blame it on the River Lea the River Lea the River Lea
So I blame it on the River Lea the River Lea the River Lea
Yeah I blame it on the River Lea the River Lea the River LeaIf youre not the one for me
Then Ill come back and bring you to your knees
If youre not the one for me
Why do I hate the idea of being free
And if Im not the one for you
Youve gotta stop holding me the way you do
Oh when you found that the one for you
Why have we been through what we have been through
Its so cold out here in your wilderness
I want you to be my keeper
But not if you are so reckless
If youre gonna let me down let me down gently
Dont pretend that you dont want me
Our love aint water under the bridge
If youre gonna let me down let me down gently
Dont pretend that you dont want me
Our love aint water under the bridge
Say that our love aint water under the bridge
What are you waiting for
You never seem to make it through the door
And who are you hiding from
It aint no life to live like youre on the run
Have I ever asked for much
The only thing that I want is your love
If youre gonna let me down let me down gently
Dont pretend that you dont want me
Our love aint water under the bridge
If youre gonna let me down let me down gently
Dont pretend that you dont want me
Our love aint water under the bridge
Say that our love aint water under the bridge
Its so cold in your wilderness
I want you to be my keeper
But not if you are so reckless
If youre gonna let me down let me down gently
Dont pretend that you dont want me
Our love aint water under the bridge
If youre gonna let me down let me down gently
Dont pretend that you dont want me
Our love aint water under the bridge
Say it aint so say it aint so
Say it aint so say it aint so
Say it aint so say it aint so

I must my way
Ive fallen off the edge to find that Ive gone blind
Youre leading me astray
You haunt me like a ghost
And that scares me the most
There you are the devil on my shoulder
Smiling as the flames are growing colder
How can I believer what I have
For a little confidence Ill grab
But when my hand goes out dont take it for Im trying to make it on my own
I fell it in my bones any minute now
This train of thought will leave the statio
My impatience will come out to play
Youve turned out to be the only face I see
Running through the empty hallways I can tell that I am not alone
You spin a web in every room
You spin a web in every room
And try to break the backbone that Ive grown
Will I make my own path or wander where Im thrown
Will I make my own path or wander where Im thrown
Or wander where Im thrownI want every single piece of you
I want your heaven and your oceans too
Treat me soft but touch me cool
I wanna teach you things you never knew baby
Bring the floor up to my knees
Let me fall into your gravity
And kiss me back to life to see
Your body standing over me
Baby dont let the lights go down
Baby dont let the lights go down
Baby dont let the lights go down
Lights go down lights go down
Lights go down lights go down
Down down down down
I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in hold me tight
Dont let go baby give me light
I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in hold me tight
Dont let go baby give me light
I love the way your body moves
Towards me from across the room
Brushing past my every groove
No one has me like you do
In your heart I bring my soul
But be delicate with my ego
I wanna step into your great unknown
With you and me setting the tone
Baby dont let the lights go down
Baby dont let the lights go down
Baby dont let the lights go down
Lights go down lights go down
Lights go down lights go down
Down down down down
I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in hold me tight
Dont let go baby give me light
I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in hold me tight
Dont let go baby give me light
We play so dirty in the dark
Cause we are living worlds apart
It only makes it harder baby
It only makes it harder baby harder baby
Harder baby harder baby harder baby

Im far too ashamed to do it with you watching me
This is never ending we have been here before
But I cant stay this time cause I dont love you anymore
Please stay where you are
Dont come any closer
Dont try to change my mind
Im being cruel to be kind
I cant love you in the dark
It feels like were oceans apart
There is so much space between us
Maybe were already defeated
Ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah everything changed me
You have given me something that I cant live without
You mustnt underestimate that when you are in doubt
But I dont want to carry on like everything is fine
The longer we ignore it all the more that we will fight
Please dont fall apart
I cant face your breaking heart
Im trying to be brave
Stop asking me to stay
I cant love you in the dark
It feels like were oceans apart
There is so much space between us
Maybe were already defeated
Ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah everything changed me
Were not the only ones
I dont regret a thing
Every word Ive said
You know Ill always mean
It is the world to me
That you are in my life
But I want to live
And not just survive
Thats why I cant love you in the dark
It feels like were oceans apart
There is so much space between us
Maybe were already defeated
Cause ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah everything changed me
And I-I-I-I-I dont think you can save meI remember all of the things that I thought I wanted to be
So desperate to find a way out of my world and finally breathe
Right before my eyes I saw my heart it came to life
This aint easy its not meant to be
Every story has its scars
When the pain cuts you deep
When the night keeps you from sleeping
Just look and you will see
That I will be your remedy
When the world seems so cruel
And your heart makes you feel like a fool
I promise you will see
That I will be I will be your remedy
No river is too wide or too deep for me to swim to you
Come whenever Ill be the shelter that wont let the rain come through
Your love it is my truth
And I will always love you
Love you
When the pain cuts you deep
When the night keeps you from sleeping
Just look and you will see
That I will be your remedy
When the world seems so cruel
And your heart makes you feel like a fool
I promise you will see
That I will be I will be your remedy ohWith your loving there aint nothing
That I cant adore
The way Im running with you honey
Is we can break every low
I find it funny that youre the only
One I never looked for
There is something in your loving
That tears down my walls
I wasnt ready then Im ready now
Im heading straight for you
You will only be eternally
The one that I belong to
The sweetest devotion
Hitting me like an explosion
All of my life Ive been frozen
The sweetest devotion Ive known
Ill forever be whatever you want me to be
Ill go under and all over for your clarity
When you wonder if Im gonna lose my way home
Just remember that come whatever Ill be yours all alone
I wasnt ready then Im ready now
Im heading straight for you
You will only be eternally
The one that I belong to
The sweetest devotion
Hitting me like an explosion
All of my life Ive been frozen
The sweetest devotion Ive known
Ive been looking for you baby
In every face that Ive ever known
And there is something bout the way you love me
That finally feels like home
All my life youre my darkness
Youre the right kind of madness
And youre my hope youre my despair
Youre my scope everything everywhere
The sweetest devotion
Hitting me like an explosion
All of my life Ive been frozen
The sweetest devotion Ive known

Learning to fly learning to run
I let my heart decide the way
When I was young
Deep down I must have always known
That this would be inevitable
To earn my stripes Id have to pay
And bear my soul
I know Im not the only one
Who regrets the things theyve done
Sometimes I just feel its only me
Who cant stand the reflection that they see
I wish I could live a little more
Look up to the sky not just the floor
I feel like my life is flashing by
And all I can do is watch and cry
I miss the air I miss my friends
I miss my mother I miss it when
Life was a party to be thrown
But that was a million years ago
When I walk around all of the streets
Where I grew up and found my feet
They cant look me in the eye
Its like theyre scared of me
I try to think of things to say
Like a joke or a memory
But they dont recognize me now
In the light of day
I know Im not the only one
Who regrets the things theyve done
Sometimes I just feel its only me
Who never became who they thought theyd be
I wish I could live a little more
Look up to the sky not just the floor
I feel like my life is flashing by
And all I can do is watch and cry
I miss the air I miss my friends
I miss my mother I miss it when
Life was a party to be thrown
But that was a million years ago
A million years agoI will leave my heart at the door
I wont say a word
Theyve all been said before you know
So why dont we just play pretend
Like were not scared of whats coming next
Or scared of having nothing left
Look dont get me wrong
I know there is no tomorrow
All I ask is
If this is my last night with you
Hold me like Im more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
It matters how this ends
Cause what if I never love again
I dont need your honesty
Its already in your eyes
And Im sure my eyes they speak for me
No one knows me like you do
And since youre the only one that matters
Tell me who do I run to
Look dont get me wrong
I know there is no tomorrow
All I ask is
If this is my last night with you
Hold me like Im more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
It matters how this ends
Cause what if I never love again
Let this be our lesson in love
Let this be the way we remember us
I dont wanna be cruel or vicious
And I aint asking for forgiveness
All I ask is
If this is my last night with you
Hold me like Im more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
It matters how this ends
Cause what if I never love againVerse one
When did it go wrong I will never know
I have loved you all my life
How did it slow down I go round and round
Thinking about it all the time
Pre-Chorus
I gave you heaven on a platter baby
I gave you everything you never gave me
I never lied and I never faked it
Only wanted for you to save me
This love it aint over yet
Theres too much that I havent said
Chorus
Did you find the note that I wrote
I hid it in the seam of your coat
It was hard to write had a lump in my throat
Do you even know that I cant let go
Why were you so cold let the truth be told
Tell me was it all for the thrill
What was I thinking I gave you everything
But you still went for the kill
Pre-Chorus
I gave you heaven on a platter baby
I gave you everything you never gave me
I never lied and I never faked it
Only wanted for you to save me
Chorus
Did you find the note that I wrote
I hid it in the seam of your coat
It was hard to write had a lump in my throat
Do you even know that I cant let go
Bridge
Oooh sometimes I feel like Im in the dark
Oooh I thought Id die in your arms
Chorus
Did you find the note that I wrote
I hid it in the seam of your coat
It was hard to write I had a lump in my throat
Do you even know that I cant let go

To go over everything

It had only just begun but now its over now
And youre in the heat of moments with your heart playing up cold
Im between the middle watching hastiness unfold
On my eyes you were smiling in the spotlight dancing with the night
The night
When I fell off your mind
Im tired of trying
Your teasing aint enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I dont get nothing back
And for what and for what and for what
When I dont get nothing back
Oy Im tired
Whered you go when you stayed behind
I looked up and inside down and outside only to find
A double taking punching hard and laughing at my smile
I get closer you obviously prefer her
Im tired of trying
Your teasing aint enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I dont get nothing back
And for what and for what and for what
When I dont get nothing back
Boy Im tired of trying
Your teasing aint enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I dont get nothing back
And for what and for what and for what
When I dont get nothing back
Oy Im tired
I should have known
Never mind said your open arms
I couldnt help believe they tricked me back into them even though
Im tired of trying
Your teasing aint enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I dont get nothing back
And for what and for what and for what
When I dont get nothing back
Boy Im tired of trying
Your teasing aint enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I dont get nothing back
And for what and for what and for what
When I dont get nothing back

Out that door
Well Ive been in town
For just about fifteen
Whole minutes now
Oh baby I feel so down
And I dont know why
I keep walking for miles
But the people
They dont understand
No girlfriends
They cant understand
Your grandsons
They wont understand
On top of this
I aint ever
Gonna understand
Last night she said
Oh baby
Dont feel so down
Oh and turned me off
When I feel left out
So I I turned around
Oh baby
Im gonna be alright
It was a great big lie
Cuz I left that night
Yeah
Oh people
They dont understand
No girlfriends
They dont understand
In spaceships
They wont understand
And me
I aint ever
Gonna understand
Last night she said
Oh baby
I feel so down
She had turned me off
When I feel left out
So I
I turned around
Oh little girl
I dont care no more
I know this for sure
Im walking
Out that door yeahYou said Im stubborn and I never give in
I think youre stubborn cept youre always softening
You say Im selfish I agree with you on that
I think youre giving out in way too much in fact
I say weve only known each other a year
You say Ive known you longer my dear
You like to be so close I like to be alone
I like to sit on chairs and you prefer the floor
Walking with each other
Think well never match at all but we do
But we do but we do but we do
I thought I knew myself somehow you know me more
Ive never known this never before
Youre the first to make up whenever we argue
I dont know who Id be if I didnt know you
Youre so provocative Im so conservative
Youre so adventurous Im so very cautious combining
You think we would and we do
But we do but we do but we do
Favoritism aint my thing but
In this situation Ill be glad
Favoritism aint my thing but
In this situation Ill be glad to make an exceptionGo ahead go ahead and smash it on the floor
Take whatever is left and take it with you out the door
See if I cry
See if I shed a single sorry tear
Cant say that its been that great
No in fact its been a wasted worried year
Chorus
Everybody sees
And everyone agrees
That you and I are wrong
And its been that way to long
Take it as it comes
And be thankful when its done
Theres so many ways to act
And theres many shades of black
Theres so many shades of black
Let it out let it all out
Say whats on your mind
You can kick and scream and shout and say things that are so unkind
Yeah-see if I care see if I stand firm or if I fall
Cause in the back of my mind and on the tip of my tongue
Is the answer to it all
Chorus
Yeah theres many shades of black
Chorus
Cause theres many shades of black
Theres so many shades of black
Yeah theres any shades of black
Theres so many shades of black
Yeah theres many shades of black
Theres so many shades of black
And theres many shades of black
Theres so many shades of black

Dont need to think it over
If Im wrong I am right
Dont need to look no further
This aint lust
I know this is love but
If I tell the world
Ill never say enough
Cause it was not said to you
And thats exactly what I need to do
If Im in love with you
Should I give up
Or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere
Or would it be a waste
Even If I knew my place should I leave it there
Should I give up
Or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere
Id build myself up
And fly around in circles
Waiting as my heart drops
And my back begins to tingle
Finally could this be it or
Should I give up
Or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere
Or would it be a waste
Even if I knew my place should I leave it there
Should I give up
Or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere yeah
Should I give up
Or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere
Or would it be a waste
Even if I knew my place should I leave it there
Should I give up
Or should I just keep on chasing pavements
Should I just keep on chasing pavements Or
Should I give up
Or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere
Or would it be a waste
Even if I knew my place should I leave it there
Should I give up
Or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhereSometimes the hole you left hurts
My heart so bad it cuts through
The deepest parts of me and fills up my mouth with the words that cry
Out Im still trying to stay inside
Hearts break and hearts wait
To make us grow from dust
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh
So that we know that it hurts
Our hearts break and hearts wait
To make us grow from dust
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh
So that we know that it hurts
Every now and then my memories ache
With empty ideas of the ones wed have made it
But as time goes on and my age gets older
I love the ones I know theyre enough to picture the rest
Cause heart break and hearts wait
To make us grow from dust
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh
So that we know that it hurts
Our hearts break and hearts wait
To make us grow from dust
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh
So that we know that it hurts
You know when to make me imagine youre here
You know when to make me imagine youre here
You know when to make me imagine youre here
You know when to make me imagine youre hereWho wants to be right as rain
Its better when something is wrong
You get excitement in your bones
And everything you dos a game
When night comes and youre on your own
You can say I chose to be alone
Who wants to be right as rain
Its harder when youre on top
Cause when hard work dont pay off
And Im tired there aint no room in my bed
As far as Im concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We wont be making up
Ive cried my heart out
And now Ive had enough of love
Who wants to be riding high
When youll just crumble back on down
You give up everything you are
And even then you dont get far
They make believe that everything
Is exactly what it seems
But at least when youre at your worst
You know how to feel things
Cause when hard work dont pay off
And Im tired there aint no room in my bed
As far as Im concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We wont be making up
Ive cried my heart out
And now Ive had enough of love
Go ahead and still my heart
To make me cry again
Cause it will never hurt
As much as it did then
We were both right
And no one had blame
But now I give up
On this endless game
Cause who wants to be right as rain
Its better when something is wrong
I get excitement in my bones
Even though everythings a strain
When night comes and Im on my own
You should know I chose to be alone
Who wants to be right as rain
Its harder when youre on top
Cause when hard work dont pay off
And Im tired there aint no room in my bed
As far as Im concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We wont be making up
Ive cried my heart out
And now Ive had enough of love
No room in my bed
As far as Im concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We wont be making up
Ive cried my heart out
And now Ive had enough of loveWait do you see my heart on my sleeve
Its been there for days on end and
Its been waiting for you to open up
Yours too baby come on now
Im trying to tell you just how
Id like to hear the words roll out of your mouth finally
Say that its always been me
Thats made you feel the way youve never felt before
And Im all you need and that you never want more
Then youd say all of the right things without a clue
But youd save the best for last
Like Im the one for you
You should know that youre just a temporary fix
This is not rooted with you it dont mean that much to me
Oh just a filler in the space that happened to be free
How dare you think youd get away with trying to play me
Why is it every time I think Ive tried my hardest
It turns out it aint enough
Youre still not mentioning love
What am I supposed to do to make you want me properly
Im taking these chances and getting nowhere
And though Im trying my hardest you go back to her
And I think that I know things may never change
Im still hoping one day I might hear you say
I make you feel the way youve never felt before
And Im all you need and that you never want more
Then youd say all of the right things without a clue
But youd save the best for last
Like Im the one for you
You should know that youre just a temporary fix
This is not rooted with you it dont mean that much to me
Oh just a filler in the space that happened to be free
How dare you think youd get away with trying to play me
But despite the truth that I know
I find it hard to let go and give up on you
Seems I love the things you do
Like the meaner you treat me the more eager I am
To persist with this heartbreak and running around
And I will do until Im finding myself you
And make you feel a way youve never felt before
And be all you need so that you never want more
And youll say all of the right things without a clue
And youll be the one for me and me the one for youSo little to say but so much time
Despite my empty mouth the words are in my mind
Please wear the face the one where you smile
Because you lighten up my heart when I start to cry
Forgive me first love but Im tired
I need to get away to feel again
Try to understand why dont get so close to change my mind
Please wipe that look out of your eyes its bribing me to doubt myself
Simply its tiring
This love has dried up and stayed behind
And if I stay Ill be alive
Then choke on words Id always hide
Excuse me first love but were through
I need to taste the kiss from someone new
Forgive me first love but Im too tired
Im bored to say the least and I I lack desire
Forgive me first love forgive me first love forgive me first love
Forgive me first love forgive me forgive me first love forgive me first loveIve been walking in the same way as I did
Missing out the cracks in the pavement
And turning my heel and strutting my feet
Is there anything I can do for you dear
Is there anyone I could call
No and thank you please Madam
I aint lost just wandering
Round my hometown
Memories are fresh
Round my hometown
Ooh the people Ive met
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of this world
Are the wonders of now
I like it in the city when the air is so thick and opaque
I love to see everybody in short skirts shorts and shades
I like it in the city when two worlds collide
You get the people and the government
Everybody taking different sides
Shows that we aint gonna stand shit
Shows that we are united
Shows that we aint gonna take it
Shows that we aint gonna stand shit
Shows that we are united
Round my hometown
Memories are fresh
Round my hometown
Ooh the people Ive met yea
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of this world
Are the wonders of my world
Of my world yeah
Of my world
Of my world yeahWhen the rain is blowing in your face
And the whole world is on your case
I could offer you a warm embrace
To make you feel my love
When the evening shadows and the stars appear
And there is no one there to dry your tears
I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love
I know you havent made your mind up yet
But I would never do you wrong
Ive known it from the moment that we met
no doubt in my mind were you belong
Id go hungry Id go black and blue
Id go crawling down the avenue
No theres nothing that I wouldnt do
To make you feel my love
The storms are raging on the rolling sea
And on the highway of regret
The winds of change are blowing wild and free
You aint seen nothing like me yet
I could make you happy make your dreams come true
Nothing that I wouldnt do
Go to the ends of the Earth for you
To make you feel my love
To make you feel my loveDaydreamer
Sitting on the sea
Soaking up the sun
He is a real lover
And making up the past
Feeling up his girl
Like hes never felt a figure before
A jaw dropper
Looks good when he walks
Is the subject of their talk
He would be hard to chase
But good to catch
And he could change the world
With his hands behind his back oh
You can find him sittin on your doorstep
Waiting for a surprise
And he will feel like hes been there for hours
And you can tell that hell be there for life
Daydreamer
With eyes that make you melt
He lends his coat for shelter
Plus hes there for you
When he shouldnt be
But he stays all the same
Waits for you
Then sees you through
Theres no way I
Could describe him
What Ill say is
Just what Im hoping for
But I will find him sittin on my doorstep
Waiting for a surprise
And he will feel like hes been there for hours
And I can tell that hell be there for life
And I can tell that hell be there for lifeFound myself today singing out your name
You said Im crazy
If I am Im crazy for you
Sometimes sitting in the dark wishing you were here
Turns me crazy
But its you who makes me lose my head
And every time Im meant to be acting sensible
You drift into my head
And turn me into a crumbling fool
Tell me to run and Ill race
If you want me to stop Ill freeze
And if you want me gone Ill leave just hold me closer baby
And make me crazy for you
Crazy for you
Lately with this state Im in I cant help myself but spin
I wish youd come over
Send me spinning closer to you
My oh my how my blood boils its sweet taste for you
Strips me down bare
And gets me into my favorite mood
I keep on trying fighting these feelings away
But the more I do
The crazier I turn into
Pacing floors and opening doors
Hoping youll walk through
And save me boy
Because Im too crazy for you
Crazy for youRight under my feet theres air made of bricks
Pulls me down turns me weak for you
I find myself repeating like a broken tune
And Im forever excusing your intentions
That I give in to my pretendings
Which forgive you each time
Without me knowing
They melt my heart to stone
And I hear your words that I made up
You say my name like there could be an us
I best tidy up my head Im the only one in love
Im the only one in love
Each and every time I turn around to leave
I feel my heart begin to burst and bleed
So desperately I try to link it with my head
But instead I fall back to my knees
As you tear your way right through me
I forgive you once again
Without me knowing
Youve burnt my heart to stone
And I hear your words that I made up
You say my name like there could be an us
I best tidy up my head Im the only one in love
Im the only one in love
Why do you steal my hand
Whenever Im standing my own ground
You build me up then leave me dead
I hear your words you made up
I say your name like there should be an us
I best tidy up my head Im the only one in love
Im the only one in loveYou say its all in my head
And the things I think just dont make sense
So where you been then Dont go all coy
Dont turn it round on me like its my fault
See I can see that look in your eyes
The one that shoots me each and every time
You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
These days when I see you
You make it look like Im see-through
Do tell me why you waste our time
When your heart aint in it and youre not satisfied
You know I know just how you feel
Im starting to find myself feeling that way too
When you grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
Time and time again I play the role of fool
Just for you
Even in the daylight when you think that
I dont see you
Try to look for things I hear but our eyes never find
Though I do know how you play
You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was herWhen we used
To say goodnight
Id always kiss
And hold you tight
But lately
You dont seem
To care
You close the door
And leave me
Standing there
Oh honey
Thats not fair
Thats it
I quit
Im movin on
The other night
We had a date
And you showed up
Two hours late
And though your hair
Was all in place
Somebody smeared
Their lipstick
On your face
Oh they smeared it
Every place
Yeah yeah thats it honey

Oooohhhh
You made me want you
You made me leave you
You made me tumble
And fall
But if I
Cant have you the way

I dont want you at all
Baby I can take a lot
Cause I love
Everything you got
Though your kisses
Sooth me so
If youve got someone else

Oh that you know
Yeah thats it honey

Oooohhhh
You made me want you
You made me leave you
You made me tumble
And fall
But if I cant have you
The way I want you

Cause I love
Everything you got
Though your kisses
Sooth me so
If you got someone else
I gotta go
Oh that you know
So thats it
Baby I quit now
Im movin on
So thats it
Baby I quit
Oh Im movin onNever been a girl who used to cry
Didnt show emotions dont know why
Didnt wanna feel the pain inside I guess
But as the years keep going by
you came along and changed my mind
I should leave the past behind me
I should let you find me
supposed to stay beside me
You were supposed to guide me
through the ups and downs
you were always gonna be around until the end
I still think we could
cause you and me were good
And Ill tell you why this hurts cause Im sober
But I just wanna be drunk
so I can forget about you
and all the stupid things that love has put me through
Even when Ive had too much
I still feel your touch
Maybe this just means that Im not drunk enough
So I pour myself another drink
whenever I start to think about you
cause I do but I really dont want to
but sometimes my dreams just come through
And when I get there
to a place where I see you in a kitchen
I start wishing for that thing and I dont need you
I dont really wanna see you
and I dont want you to see me
you would think that I was crazy
you might think that I wanna be close to you
but Id rather wanna drink some Whisky
and maybe have a little sip o wine
cause right now its the only thing that makes me forget you were mine
but right now I am sober
But I just wanna be drunk
so I can forget about you
and all the stupid things that love has put me through
Even when Ive had too much
I still feel your touch
Maybe this just means that Im not drunk enough
I still think we could
Im not drunk enough
cause you and me were good
cause Im sober
But I just wanna be drunk
so I can forget about you
and all the stupid things that love has put me through
Even when Ive had too much
I still feel your touch
Maybe this just means that Im not drunk enough
I still think we could
But I just wanna be drunk
so I can forget about you
and all the stupid things that love has put me through
cause you and me were good
Even when Ive had too much
I still feel your touch
Maybe this just means that Im not drunk enoughPainting pictures with my mind
Making memories using my eyes
Filling up my heart with golden stories
Who adds some spice to the rhythm of life oh
Welcome sunrise with the morning glory
Ive changed my mind
There is no simple
I thought of me I want to see
I want to feel my heartbeat so
With the world that you feel leave
I can feel the pressure pushing onto my heart
And its teasing me
To scratch my itch and beat my drum
So I can start to begin whats begun
Painting pictures
Filling up my heart with golden stories
Painting pictures
Filling up my heart with golden stories
Running riots inside my soul
Fire burning and its lighting me up
To scratch my itch and beat my drum
So I can finish what has begun
Painting pictures
Filling up my heart with golden stories
Painting pictures
Filling up my heart with golden storiesDont ask me
What you know is true
Dont have to tell you
I love your precious heart
I was standing
You were there
Two worlds collided
And they could never tear us apart
We could live
For a thousand years
But if I hurt you
Id make wine from your tears
I told you
That we could fly
Cause we all have wings
But some of us dont know whyIn the darkness of my heart is a shadow of your face
From the deepest part of my regret
I hear the words I wish Id said
At the dawning of the day
I cant wait to see the light
Make up memories in my head
They help to fill the emptiness youve left
I cant drown in your tears
I wont face your fears
I need to fight my own
Youll never see me again oh baby in time
Let the weight take me under
I know Ill survive
Youll never see me again
At the dawning of the day
I cant bare to see the light
Make up memories in my head
They help to fill the emptiness youve left
I cant drown in your tears
I wont face your fears
I need to fight my own
Youll never see me again oh baby in time
Let the weight take me under
I know Ill survive
Let the floor beneath of me fall
Let the sky come crashing down
Turn all my right to wrong
But after you that goes on
Youll never see me again
Ive been learning to live without you
Its taken all of my stake
But Im stronger now
Youll never see me again oh baby in time
Let the weight take me under
I know Ill surviveI know sometimes youre scared of the light
But how will you ever know if you never try
Theres something new inside my heart
And it grabs like a child whenever were apart
I see your face under every sky
I find the less I look more I find
So lets go back there back to the star
You know Im never gonna leave you
Youre the only one I want
Lets go back there back to the star
You know Im never gonna leave you
Youre the only one I want
You know sometimes that Im scared of the dark
But Im feeling sun babe when Im in your arms
You said my name in the dead of glory
You hold me alright
When Im short of falling
So lets go back there back to the star
You know Im never gonna leave you
Youre the only one I want
Lets go back there back to the star
You know Im never gonna leave you
Youre the only one I want
There will be times
When well try to give it up
Bursting out it seems no doubt that will almost fall apart than burn to pieces
And well watch them turn to dust
But without each other nothing is easy enoughWell you can tell by the way I use my walk

Just remember when we lie to each other
No one wins and losers weep
Reflection will show
This connection we can lean on each other
This is all we need to know
Now I admit Ive been a fool sometimes
I believe I may be losing you
Its now or never we talk before a tear is shed
Under your spell and over my head
You took me in your arms and you told me
We dont need to worry but you
You never say youre sorry
Keep this love alive for us its all I feel
How can we survive if we change what is real
Still waters run deep
Just remember when we lie to each other
No one wins and losers weep
Reflection will show
This connection we can lean on each other
This is all we need to know
I see the angel and the devil in your heart
I confess either one is my addiction
And where youre leading me
I dont have the will to fight
Out of the darkness and into the light
But living in your arms I can take it
Please dont make me shiver
I know together we deliver
Let the gods decide
Who finds the sweetest thrill
Who can justify the truth
God I love you still
Still waters run deep
Just remember when we lie to each other
No one wins and losers weep losers weep
Deception will show
Its a struggle when youre starved for affection ah
This is all we need
Oooh
Dont let him get too close to you
youve got a stranger on your mind
The dream is free
I know Im only human if I cry
Or maybe we should kiss and say goodbye
Ah Girl I love you still
Still waters run deep
Just remember when we lie to each other ah
No one wins and losers weep no one wins
Deception will show show
Its a struggle when youre starved for affection
This is all we need to know
Still Still waters run deep
Just remember when we lie to each other
No one wins and losers weep
Reflection will show
This connection we can lean on each other
This is all we need to knowBaby when I met you there was peace unknown
I set out to get you with a fine tooth comb
I was soft inside
There was something going on
You do something to me that I cant explain
Hold me closer and I feel no pain
And every beat of my heart
We got something going on
Tender love is blind
It requires a dedication
All this love we feel needs no conversation
We ride it together ah ha
From one love to another ah ha
Islands in the stream
That is what we are
No one in between
How can we be wrong
Sail away with me
To another world
And we rely on each other ah ha
From one lover to another ah ha
I cant live without you if the love was gone
Everything is nothing when you got no one
And you walk in the night
Slowly losing sight of the real thing
But that wont happen to us and we got no doubt
Too deep in love and we got no way out
And the message is clear
This could be the year for the real thing
No more will you cry
Baby I will hurt you never
We start and end as one
In love forever
We can ride it together ah ha
From love to another ah ha
Islands in the stream
That is what we are
No one in between
How can we be wrong
Sail away with me
To another world
And we rely on each other ah ha
From one lover to another ah haI know your eyes in the morning sun
I feel you touch me in the pouring rain
And the moment that you wander far from me
I want to feel you in my arms again
And you come to me on a summer breeze
Keep me warm in your love then you softly leave
And its me you need to show
How deep is your love how deep is your love
How deep is your love
I really mean to learn
Cause were living in a world of fools
Breaking us down when they all should let us be
We belong to you and me
I believe in you
You know the door to my very soul
Youre the light in my deepest darkest hour
Youre my savior when I fall
And you may not think I care for you
When you know down inside that I really do
And its me you need to show
How deep is your love how deep is your love
How deep is your love
I really mean to learn
Cause were living in a world of fools
Breaking us down when they all should let us be
We belong to you and me

You you make me see the light
Show me that my search is over
I pay the price I pay the price
Tell you someday baby you and I should be one one
Do it always brighter than the eye can see we hide the sun
The taste of love is sweeter like honey on the vine
Like the wind that feeds the fire two souls become entwined
Someday baby you and I should be one one
So Im standing round this corner
Tall enough to touch the New York sky oh yes
My love is so blind
I just cannot hear or see the world go by oh yes
Someone can love so completely
One kiss should break the sea
Truth can be stranger than fiction
This love is real
This love is real
Tell you someday baby you and I should be one one
Do it always brighter than the eye can see we hide the sun
Ah we are one we are one
I will follow
Count on me Ill never let you down oh yes
My devotion
If love is like an ocean Ill surely drown oh yes
Youll be my only possession
Ill be a slave to you
We hold the power together
Just me and you
Just me and you
Tell you someday baby you and I should be one one
Do it always brighter than the eye can see we hide the sun
Tell you someday baby you and I should be one one
You know my life is in your hands
And every breath you take is planned
And all this love goes on forever
Tell you someday Baby you and I should be one one
Do it always baby you and I should be one one
Do it someday baby you and I should be one one
Do it always baby you and I should be one one
Do it someday baby you and I should be one one
Do it always baby you and I should be one oneShadows falling baby we stand alone
Out on the street anybody you meet got a heartache of their own
It oughta be illegal
Make it a crime to be lonely or sad
It oughta be illegal
You got a reason for living
You battle on with the love youre living on
You gotta be mine
We take it away
Its gotta be night and day
Just a matter of time
And we got nothing to be guilty of
Our love will climb any mountain
Near or far we are
And we never let it end
We are devotion
And we got nothing to be sorry for
Our love is one in a million
Eyes can see that we
Got a highway to the sky
I dont want to hear your goodbye
Oh
Aah
Pulses racing darling
How grand we are
Little by little we meet in the middle
Theres danger in the dark
It oughta be illegal
Make it a crime to be out in the cold
It oughta be illegal
You got a reason for living
You battle on with the love youre building on
You gotta be mine
We take it away
Its gotta be night and day
Just a matter of time
And we got nothing to be guilty of
Our love will climb and mountain
Near or far we are
And we never let it end
We are devotion
And we got nothing to be sorry for
Our love is one in a million
Eyes can see that we
Got a highway to the sky
I dont want to hear your goodbye
Dont want to hear your goodbye
I dont want to hear your
And we got nothing and we got nothing to be guilty of
Our love will climb and mountain
Near or far we are
And we never let it end
We are devotion
And we got nothing to be sorry for
Our love is one in a million
Eyes can see that we
Got a highway to the sky
Dont want to hear your goodbye
Dont want to hear your
And we got nothing to be guilty ofI can think of younger days
When living for my life
Was everything a man could want to do
I could never see tomorrow
But I was never told about the sorrow
How can you mend a broken heart
How can you stop the rain from falling down
How can you stop the sun from shining
What makes the world go round
How can you mend this broken man
How can a loser ever win
Please help me mend my broken heart
And let me live again
I can still feel the breeze
That rustles through the trees
And misty memories of days gone by
We could never see tomorrow
But no one said a word about the sorrow
How can you mend a broken heart
How can you stop the rain from falling down
How can you stop the sun from shining
What makes the world go round
And how can you mend this broken man
How can a loser ever win
Please help me mend my broken heart
And let me live again
La la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la
Please help me mend my broken heart
And let me live again

The music plays so nonchalant
Lonely days lonely nights

You got me crying like I thought I would never be
Love is believing but you let me down
How can I love you when you aint around
And I
Get to the morning and you never call
Love should be everything or not at all
And it dont matter whatever you do
I made a life out of loving you
Only to find any dream that I follow is dying
Im crying in the rain
I could be searching my world for a love everlasting
Feeling no pain
when will we meet again
Why do you have to be a heartbreaker
is it a lesson that I never knew
Gotta get out of the spell that Im under
My love for you
Why do you have to be a heartbreaker
when I was being what you want me to be
Suddenly everything I ever wanted has passed me by
This world may end
not you and I
My love is stronger than the universe
My soul is crying for you
and that cannot be reversed
You made the rules and you could not see
you made a life out of hurting me
Out of my mind
I am held by the power of you love
Tell me when do we try
Or should we say goodbye
Why do you have to be a heartbreaker
when I was being what you want me to be
Suddenly everything I ever wanted has passed me by
Oh
Why do you have to be a heartbreaker
is it a lesson that I never knew
Suddenly everything I ever wanted
My love for you ooh
Why do you have to be a heartbreakerIn the event of something happening to me
There is something I would like you all to see
Its just a photograph of someone that I knew
Have you seen my wife Mr Jones
Do you know what its like on the outside
Dont go talking too loud youll cause a landslide Mr Jones
I keep straining my ears to hear a sound
Maybe someone is digging underground
Or have they given up and all gone home to bed
Thinking those who once existed must be dead
Have you seen my wife Mr Jones
Do you know what its like on the outside
Dont go talking too loud youll cause a landslide Mr Jones
In the event of something happening to me
There is something I would like you all to see
Its just a photograph of someone that I knew
Have you seen my wife Mr Jones
Do you know what its like on the outside
Dont go talking too loud youll cause a landslide Mr JonesListen to the ground

Somethings telling me I must go home
And the lights all went out in Massachusetts
The day I left her standing on her own
Tried to hitch a ride to San Francisco
Gotta do the things I wanna do
And the lights all went out in Massachusetts
They brought me back to see my way with you
Talk about the life in Massachusetts
Speak about the people I have seen
And the lights all went out in Massachusetts
And Massachusetts is one place I have seen
I will remember MassachusettsNobody gets too much heaven no more
Its much harder to come by
Im waiting in line
Nobody gets too much love anymore
Its as high as a mountain
And harder to climb
Oh you and me girl
Got a lot of love in store
And it flows through you
And it flows through me
And I love you so much more
Then my life I can see beyond forever
Everything we are will never die
Lovings such a beautiful thing
Oh you make my world a summer day
Are you just a dream to fade away
Nobody gets too much heaven no more
Its much harder to come by
Im waiting in line
Nobody gets too much love anymore
Its as high as a mountain
And harder to climb
You and me girl got a highway to the sky
We can turn away from the night and day
And the tears you had to cry
Youre my life
I can see a new tomorrow
Everything we are will never die
Lovings such a beautiful thing
When you are to me the light above
Made for all to see our precious love
Nobody gets too much heaven no more
Its much harder to come by
Im waiting in line
Nobody gets too much love anymore
Its as high as a mountain
And harder to climb
Love is such a beautiful thing
You make my world a summer day
Are you just a dream to fade away
Nobody gets too much heaven no more
Its much harder to come by
Im waiting in line
Nobody gets too much love anymore
Its as wide as a river
And harder to climb
Nobody gets too much heaven no more
Its much harder to come by
Im waiting in line
Nobody gets too much love anymore
Its as high as a mountain
And harder to climb
Nobody gets too much heaven no more
Its much harder to come by
Im waiting in line
Nobody gets too much love anymore
Its as high as a mountain
And harder to climbI stumble in the night
Never really knew what it wouldve been like
Youre no longer there to break my fall
The heartache over you
Id give it everything but I couldnt live through
I never saw the signs
Youre the last to know when love is blind
All the tears and the turbulent years
When I would not wait for no-one
Didnt stop and take a look at myself
And see me losing you
When the lonely heart breaks
Its the one that forsakes
Its the dream that we stole
And Im missing you more
Than the fire that will roar
Theres a hole in my soul
For you its goodbye
For me its to cry
For whom the bell tolls
Seen you in a magazine
A picture at a party where you shouldnt have been
Hanging on the arm of someone else
Im still in love with you
Wont you come back to your little boy blue
Ive come to feel inside
This precious love was never mine
Now I know but a little too late
That I could not live without you
In the dark or the broad daylight
I promise Ill be there
When the lonely heart breaks
Its the one that forsakes
Its the dream that we stole
And Im missing you more
Than the fire that will roar
Theres a hole in my soul
For you its goodbye
For me its to cry
For whom the bell tolls
Now I know therell be times like this
When I couldnt reach out to no-one
Am I never gonna find someone
Who knows me like you do
Are you leaving me a helpless child
When it took so long to save me
Fight the devil and the deep blue sea
Ill follow you anywhere
I promise Ill be there
When the lonely heart breaks
Its the one that forsakes
Its the dream that we stole
And Im missing you more
Than the fire that will roar
Theres a hole in my soul
For you its goodbye
For me its to cry
For whom the bell tollsI was a midnight rider on a cloud of smoke
I could make a woman hang on every single stroke
I was an iron man I had a master plan
But I was alone
I could hear you breathing with a sigh of the wind
I remember how your body started trembling
Oh what a night its been and for the state Im in
Im still alone
And all the wonders made for the earth
And all the hearts in all creation
Somehow I always end up alone
Always end up alone always end up alone
So Ill play Ill wait
Cause you know that love takes time
Living love between the line
We came sha la so close so far
Just the beat of a lonely heart
And its mine and I dont want to be alone
Well since I got no message on your answer phone
Since youre busy every minute I just stay at home
I make believe you care I feel you everywhere
But Im still alone
Im on a wheel of fortune with a twist of fate
Cause I know it isnt heaven is it love or hate
Am I the subject of the pain
Am I the stranger in the rain I am alone
And is there glory there to behold
Maybe its my imagination another story there to be told
So I play sha la Ill wait sha la
And I pray its not too late
We came sha la so far so far
Just a beat of a lonely heart and its mi-i-ine
And I dont want to be alone
And all the wonders made for the earth
And all the hearts in all creation
Another story there to be told
So Ill play Ill wait
And Ill pray its not too late
We can so far
Just the beat of a lonely heart
And its mine
And I dont want to be alone
Gone but not out of sight
Im caught in the rain and theres no one home
Face the heat of the night
The one that you loves got a heart thats made of stone
Shine and search for the light
And sooner or later youll be cruising on your ocean
And clean out of site
Im caught in the rain and theres no one homeNobody gets too much heaven no more
Its much harder to come by
Im waiting in line
Nobody gets too much love anymore
Its as high as a mountain
And harder to climb

And it flows through me
And I love you so much more

Living tomorrow where in the world will I be tomorrow
How far am I able to see
Or am I needed here
Now I found that the world is round
And of course it rains everyday
If I remember all of the things I have done
Id remember all of the times Ive gone wrong
Why do they keep me hereFeel Im goin back to Massachusetts
Somethings telling me I must go home
And the lights all went out in Massachusetts
The day I left her standing on her own
Tried to hitch a ride to San Francisco
Gotta do the things I wanna do
And the lights all went out in Massachusetts
They brought me back to see my way with you
Talk about the life in Massachusetts
Speak about the people I have seen
And the lights all went out in Massachusetts
And Massachusetts is one place I have seen
I will remember MassachusettsLove So Right
She came on like the night and she held on tight
And the world was right when she made love to me
We were free
She moved in like a friend started loving me
And I thought Id found my heaven in her arms
But the morning when I woke up
I was here and she was gone
Now Im hanging on
Maybe you can tell me how a love so right can turn out to be so wrong
Where did she go when I need her close to me
And the perfect story ended at the start
I thought you came forever and you came to break my heart
Now Im hanging on on the chance that youll come back to me
How a love so right can turn out to be so wrong oh my darling
How a love so right can turn out to be so wrong oh my darling
I could take it in my stride
Start living for the moment
Maybe half the things we sought were never there
Simply open up our eyes and break it down to size
It isnt really fair
How a love so right can turn out to be so wrong oh my darling
How a love so right can turn out to be so wrong oh my darling
How a love so right can turn out to be so wrong oh my darlingHere I lie
In a lost and lonely part of town
Held in time
In a world of tears I slowly drown
Goin home
I just cant make it all alone
I really should be holding you
Holding you
Loving you loving you
Tragedy
When the feelings gone and you cant go on
Its tragedy
When the morning cries and you dont know why
Its hard to bear
With no one to love you
Youre goin nowhere
Tragedy
When you lose control and you got no soul
Its tragedy
When the morning cries and you dont know why
Its hard to bear
With no one beside you
Youre goin nowhere
Night and day
Theres a burning down inside of me
Burning love
With a yearning that wont let me be
Down I go
And I just cant take it all alone
I really should be holding you
Holding you
Loving you loving you
Tragedy
When the feelings gone and you cant go on
Its tragedy
When the morning cries and you dont know why
Its hard to bear
With no one to love you
Youre goin nowhere

A smile can bring you near to me

So little timeI started a joke which started the whole world crying
But I didnt see that the joke was on me oh no
I started to cry which started the whole world laughing
Oh If Id only seen that the joke was on me
I looked at the skies running my hands over my eyes
And I fell out of bed hurting my head from things that I said
Till I finally died which started the whole world living
Oh if Id only seen that the joke was on me
I looked at the skies running my hands over my eyes
And I fell out of bed hurting my head from things that I said
Till I finally died which started the whole world living
Oh if Id only seen that the joke was on me
Oh no that the joke was on meOh my heart wont believe that you have left me

Dont forget to remember me
And the love that used to be
I still remember you

In my heart lies a memory to tell the stars above
Dont forget to remember me my love
On my wall lies a photograph of you girl
Though I try to forget you somehow
Youre the mirror of my soul so take me out of my hole
Let me try to go on living right now
Dont forget to remember me
And the love that used to be
I still remember you

In my heart lies a memory to tell the stars above
Dont forget to remember me my loveBaby I cant figure it out
Your kisses taste like honey
Sweet lies dont gimme no rise

Its enough to leave me crying in the rain
Love you forever but youre
Driving me insane
And Im hanging on
Oh oh Ill win Ill never give in
Our love has got the power
Too many lovers in one lifetime
Aint good for you
You treat me like a vision in the night
Someone there to stand behind you
When your world aint working right
I aint no vision I am the man
Who loves you inside out
Backwards and forwards with
My heart hanging out

What am I gonna do if we lose that fire
Wrap myself up and take me home again
Too many heartaches in one
Lifetime aint good for me

Let this moment be forever
We wont ever feel the storm
I aint no vision I am the man
Who loves you inside out
Backwards and forwards with
My heart hanging out

What am I gonna do if we lose that fire
Dont try to tell me its all over

No man could love you more
And thats what Im cryin for
You cant change the way I feel inside
Youre the reason for my laughter and my sorrow
Blow out the candle I will burn again tomorrow
No man on earth can stand
Between my love and I
And no matter how you hurt me

You took advantage and the damage done

I played the fool and I went off the track
And when I think of all it cost
When the dice was cast
You know I had to be crazy
You know I had to be
Ive been telling lies
And you forgive me but my heart still cries
And you can understand
Im just the man in the middle
Of a complicated plan
No one to show me the signs
Im just a creature of habit
In a complicated world
Nowhere to run to
Nowhere to hide to hide to hide to hide
I know I let you down in so many ways
I know that sorry doesnt tell you
What you need me to say
But I would die for you baby
Yes I would die for you
Ive been in disguise
And you forgive me and our love will rise
And you can understand

Of a complicated plan
No one to show me the light

The city of dreams just keeps on getting me down
Cause my babys no longer around
And my feeling can never be found
Another lonely night in New York
And my sorry eyes are lookin out on the world
Baby you said a guy like me was way out of line
And knowing today your leavin was a question of time
In the mist of a sweet summer rain you will find me here
Should the sparkle of stars lose their way

Another lonely night in New York
The city of dreams just keeps on getting me down
Cause my babys no longer around
And my feelings can never be found

And my sorry eyes are lookin out on the world

We can take your breath awayIn the streets of New York City
Every man can feel the cold
And I dont want no pity
But I want my story told
When the lights shine down on me
They shine on the little boy
Is this way to make him pay
Being born in a world of joy
But like me
He dont know where hell go wrong
He wont cry so many tears
Til he finds out why he dont belong like me
Theres no room for us out there
You can lose your hope and pride
When it comes to broken dreams
Youll get your share
Sometime a man breaks down
And the good thing he is looking for
Are crushed into the ground
Get on up look around
Cant you feel the wind of change
Get on up taste the air
Cant you see the wind of change
Dont you understand what Im sayin
We need a god down there
A man to lead us children
Take us from the valley of fear
Make the lights shine down on us
Show us the road to go
Help us survive make us arrive
Teach us what we need to know
But like me
He dont know where hell go wrong
He wont cry so many tears
Till he finds out why he dont belong like me
Theres no room for us out there
You can lose your hope and pride
When it comes to broken dreams
Youll get your share
Sometime a man breaks down
And the good thing he is looking for
Are crushed into the ground
Get on up look around
Cant you feel the wind of change
Get on up taste the air
Cant you see the wind of change
Get on upI know your eyes in the morning sun
I feel you touch me in the pouring rain
And the moment that you wander far from me
I want to feel you in my arms again
And you come to me on a summer breeze
Keep me warm in your love then you softly leave
And its me you need to show
How deep is your love how deep is your love
How deep is your love
I really mean to learn
Cause were living in a world of fools
Breaking us down when they all should let us be
We belong to you and me
I believe in you
You know the door to my very soul
Youre the light in my deepest darkest hour
Youre my savior when I fall
And you may not think I care for you
When you know down inside that I really do
And its me you need to show
How deep is your love how deep is your love
How deep is your love

So why dont you grow up and be a policeman
And probably then youll be with men
Or maybe be a walker with a guitar but then youll stop and start to crawl
Down came the sun
The world has finally won
Bang goes the earth
The stars and the sky know what its worth
Now Im an evil man I sing a new song
But all the same Im still to blame
So now my only son is leaving teaching
And on the run for bad is done
Down came the sun
The world has finally won
Boom goes the moon
We wonder why it happened so soonMany years ago I was a simple man
A simple man no worries me
I never lied
Please read me
Not much conversation ever came from me
I never saw reality
I never tried
Please read me
Maybe Ive been lying on your couch too long
Ill stay if you can see me through explain why
Please read me Please read me Please read meThis is my dedication
This is my dedication
Im not a saint but stand accused
Youre with someone who thinks loves the same as being used
And now suspicious minds may say its over over
Whether I live or die you are my savior
Youre my savior
Its my deja vu sweet deja vu
Through the feast or famine Ill be with you
Sheltering arms reach out to you
This is my dedication Repeat 
The silent nights I cry your name
Youre with someone who says
They can get you through your pain
These golden years keep on returning
Its hurting
Precious and few
Youre my savior youre my savior
Its my deja vu sweet deja vu
Through the feast or famine Ill be with you
Sheltering arms reach out to you
This is my dedication
This is my dedication
This is my dedication
La la la
And cherish what theyve lost
When often its too late
Its my deja vu memories of you
Sweet deja vu keep coming through
Through the feast or famine
Ill be with you all that is true
Sheltering arms reach out to you
Oh baby
This is my dedication
This is my dedication
This is my dedicationKathys eyes were full of alibies she always played around
Kathy said she needed life instead of a suburban town
And she didnt care when things were wrong or right
Headin out towards the city lights
Tellin me that at last shes alive alive
Kathys gone and I cant go on
I been cryin lonely nights
No one knows where the true love goes in the end
Oh oh oh Kathy she shot down my world thats no surpise
Oh Kathys dream to be a movie queen was her obsession
Sweet reviews inside the morning news was her reflection
And she ran away to find a fantasy
With the lovers and the limosines
Could it be that at last shes alive alive
Kathys gone and I cant go on
Ive been cryin lonely nights
No one knows where the true love goes in the end
Oh oh oh Kathy she shot down my world
in a love affair no one can mend

Just put me down and set me free set me freeToday I saw the sun
To rise to fall but can you forgive me
I sail upon this mortal storm
And hearts that cry and love is to leave me
Were miles apart
I know my aim is true
It keeps this flame from dying
I just stay alive
Angel of mercy
I know that Ill find you
So its to my God in heaven that I pray
We can fly away
So its shining in the darkness of my day
We can fly away
The voice is on the wind
I steal the stars the course I must follow
No space or time no sleep the soul
It lies awake it craves to be near you
It drives me on
I know my aim is true
It keeps my flame from dying
We might live again
Angel of mercy
I know that Ill find you
So its to my God in heaven that I pray
We can fly away
Write a letter in the sand
That only lovers understand
And when the words are said and done
That we must come together
Angel of mercy
I know that Ill find you
So its to my God in heaven that I pray
We can fly away
Sailing on a sea of gold
Where silver wings of angels go
I can see a million miles
That love goes on forever
Write a letter in the sand
That only lovers understand
And when the words are said and done
That we must come together
Sailing on a sea of gold
Where silver wings of angels go
I can see a million miles
That love goes on foreverAll that I hear doesnt feel right Dont
Call me till youre all right I listened
And I heard but dont tell me

Sometimes he is right
What a shame its
The same each day

If we can take the same direction well find
The road that never ends
But love never dies
It goes on forever love never dies

No sad stories to deny
I go through holy war for you baby you know

To God above I swear
I only wanna live in the shadow you make
The soul never lies

How deep is your love how deep is your love
How deep is your love
I really mean to learn
Cause were living in a world of fools
Breaking us down when they all should let us be
We belong to you and me
And you come to me on a summer breeze
Keep me warm in your love then you softly leave
And its me you need to show
How deep is your love how deep is your love
How deep is your love
I really mean to learn
Cause were living in a world of fools
Breaking us down when they all should let us be
We belong to you and me
How deep is your love how deep is your love
I really mean to learn
Cause were living in a world of fools
Breaking us down when they all should let us be
We belong to you and me
How deep is your love how deep is your love
I really mean to learn
Cause were living in a world of fools
Breaking us down when they all should let us be
We belong to you and meI got a bad sensation
The enemy is all around
The traces of my naked heart
Are laid upon the ground
I suffered side effects
That might have been forever
Even in my dreams
And I was left alone to pray
When there was no one in the way
And nothin what it seemed
And from a hard time play time
Took a trip around the world
Made myself invisible
The taste was in the wine
And just when the thought of someone
Needing me forever
I dont believe the words are true
That only she could be my savior
Experience is not enough
Ill show you how to fall in love
She said experience is not enough
Ill show you how to fall in love
And shes all alone with me
Every night
And lighting all my days of sorrow
On my own
If there was any more to give
You know Id sacrifice it for her
And in the prime of my life
I was blessed and I was sent
Someone sweet and innocent
And nervous when she kissed
And in the face of my
Forbidden fruit forever
Miracles are mine
And knowing Im the first
In her secret universe
Theres no sense of space and time
You take a small town young girl
Someone warm and wonderful
That any man would understand
That love is like the wind
Something deep inside to give you
And when the words get in the way
The only thing you need is silence
Experience is not enough
Ill show you how to fall in love
She said experience is not enough
Ill show you how to fall in loveI know my street thats where I live
I never take I always give
They always leave me on the shelf
I live my life all by myself
My car aint big I cant go fast
And evry drink I takes the last
Im always tryin to save my health
I live my life all by myself
Evrything I have I own and no one lives on me
Im a man who stands alone
Thats where Ill be
Thats where Ill be
So take your hand down off my chair
cause Im the one whos sitting there
And I aint neve seen no wealth
I live my live all by myself
My car aint big I cant go fast
And evry drink I takes the last
Im always tryin to save my health
I live my life all by myself
Evrything I have I own and no one lives on me
Im a man who stands alone
Thats where Ill be
Thats where Ill be
Thats where Ill be
So take your hand down off my chair
cause Im the one whos sitting there
And I aint never seen no wealth
I live my live all by myself
I live my life all by myselfIm full of pride and my heart feels good
Got news from my family up in the woods
At last I can go back where I belong
Sweated it all out for nine long years
Couldnt believe the voice in my ears
When the man saying no hiding son
So I left the only folks I had known
I was fifteen then hardly grown
When they found me in the swamp face down in the mud
Couldnt get back and I couldnt go far
Said to myself stay right where you are
Done found yourself a ma and pa
Chorus
Everybody said the kids no good
Come home johnny bride come home
Johnny bride come home
Were all wrong without you
How did we ever doubt you
He confessed to the killing
Its his role we had you filling
We didnt really mean to make you sad
But when you ran you made us think that you were twice as bad
I left the only folks I had known
I was fifteen then hardly grown
When they found me in the swamp face down in the mud
Couldnt get back and I couldnt go far
Said to myself stay right where you are
Done found yourself a ma and pa
Chorus
But when you ran you made us think that you were twice as bad RepeatsWhen the summer day is over
Its busy cares have flown
I will sit beneath the starlight
With a weary heart alone
Then it rises like a vision
Sparkling bright it shines for me
My own dear Ellan Vannin
With its green hills by the sea
Let me hear the ocean murmur
Let me watch your stormy sky
Then above the emerald waters
Sings the seagull as she flies
Then it rises like a vision
Sparkling bright it shines for me
My own dear Ellan Vannin
With its green hills by the seaCome to me baby I got something to say
I been changin your direction evry step of the way
Now I bring emotion and I bring desire
And I bring the potion to set you on fire
I know you need me there can be no doubt
You got me held inside your love and I cant get out
We must surrender to the powers that be
The angel in you and the devil in me
Warm ride warm ride baby just the way you are
Warm ride warm ride we can reach the highest star
Now I warn you women we are two of a kind
And we both know whats coming
We got one thing in mind
I bring the pleasure satisfaction you learn
And I got the strength to make you burn baby burn
Warm ride warm ride baby just the way you are
Warm ride warm ride we can reach the highest star
Why are we waiting for this love on the rise
And why am I searching for the magic thats in your eyes
We must surrender to the powers that be
The angel in you and the devil in me
Warm ride warm ride baby just the way you are
Warm ride warm ride we can reach the highest star
Warm ride warm ride baby just the way you are
Warm ride warm ride we can reach the highest star
Warm rideYou stepped into my life
And Im oh so happy
You stepped into my life
Stepped into my life
Stepped into my life
And Im oh so happy
You stepped into my life
And Im oh so
Before you came my way
I always checked this out
So much pain in love
And so alone inside
I never thought
That Id believe in love so much
But darling when you came close to me
Suddenly suddenlyAnother cold and windy day
The birds are homing to come to stay
And as I feel my mind is turning
And think of times when I were glad
I open up some Coke and smile
And then my minds free for a while
Things go better with Coca-Cola
Things go better with Coke
Things go better with Coca-Cola
Things go better with CokeI am the searcher of my fortunes
Ive got my right hand on the wheel
Weve got to dig for buried treasures
I know exactly how I feel
I went walkin through a graveyard
Where the darkness is my friend
I heard all about the beginning
I want to see just where it ends
I have fed the jaded tiger
And every tiger knows my name
But just as long as long as I can see my face
I can tell myself my name
Dont want to live inside myself
Im much better of alone
But then you must believe in the fallin rain
In the morning
Bury me down by the river
Saved by the bell
Man for all seasonsI aint got no claim to nothing
I dont mess with anyone
I walk my way
Living in a masquerade
And one day I looked behind me
At all the things Ive done
Thats the first mistake
I ever made
I was born to a lonely woman
In a town called Buffalo
Never knew the man
Who never stayed
With my twelve-string on my back
I discovered every track
Thats the first mistake
I ever made
With a million hearts Ive broken
I never kept the score
Memories of good love
Hate to stay
But I still remember someone
Who loved me so much more
Thats the first mistake
I ever made
So when nothings worth the living
And in the night I look above
Prayed about a million times
I prayed
I know my story ended
When I lost my only love
Thats the first mistake
I ever made
I was born to a lonely woman
In a town called Buffalo
Never knew the man
Who never stayed
With my twelve-string on my back
I discovered every track
Thats the first mistake
I ever madeI thought Id already touched the sky
I got to know you and I dont know why
All of my life couldnt mean as much
As just being touched by you
I never thought of me growing up
Got my directions but the road was rough
Its only the dream of a teenage queen
But somehow I made through
And Id love to see those faces of those friends I left behind
And even those who spoke for me just trying to be kind
And no one said I love you just the way I know you do
And I love being in love with you
Living inside your heart
The giving and taking
You are not forsaken
I love being in love with you
Thank you just for choosing me
That we should be
Being in love forever and ever ever
I stare and wonder at what I found
I just discovered why the world is round
Round in a circle my arms will be
And doing the same as you
It aint right its only for you and me
Only the lonely do it separately
Keep it alive on the food of love
But only the chosen few
In my life you see some change in me we listen and we grow
Any child that clings to childish things is trying to let go
And up to now Id thought Id seen as far as I could see
And I love being in love with you
Living inside your heart
The giving and taking
You are not forsaken
I love being in love with you
Thank you just for choosing me
That we should be
Being in love forever and ever ever
And I love being in love with you
Living inside your heart
The giving and taking
You are not forsaken
I love being in love with you
Thank you just for choosing me
That we should be
I love being in love with you
Living inside your heart
The giving and taking
You are not forsaken
I love being in love with youMaybe you dont know me anymore then I know you
And I wouldnt blame you if you walked away
I been watchin you all evenin with the teardrops in your eyes
And it touches me much more then I can say
You know Id hate to think that someone
could have hurt someone like you
And if I was him Id be right by your side
Lay your troubles on my shoulders
Put your worries in my pocket
Rest your love on me awhile
Lay your troubles on my shoulder
Put your worries in my pocket
Rest your love on me awhile
Saw you in the corner on the moment I walked in
Saw your lonely face across the room
No I wont forget it
And the way it might have been
Why did you have to leave so soon
You know Id hate to think that someone
could have loved you more than me
And at times like this Id be right by your side
How long must I wait for the last train to be here
And the last chance to know
Get to think that I was born too soon
How long honey when the lovin dont come
I was there when you left me
Just didnt know how to beginThey say a fool never learns
You agree Im not superstitious
You know unlucky as Ive been Im still around
And you can tell me to go
Ive been reading your true confessions
But then you dont believe Id let this chance go by
Show me inside
Sorry that Ive been so far away
You know Im only human
Its the call of the wild
Its the law of the jungle
Dont say no
Want to be with you wont you stay with me overnight
Give a little bit to you wont you stay with me stay
Pulling me to you wont you stay with me overnight
Itll be forever if you stay with me stay with me stay
As long as time will allow youll be losing your inhibitions
One night is not enough for all the love to grow
And baby you and I rule the world
Maybe I could be your magician
Just give me long enough
My spell will hypnotize
Show me inside
Live in every corner of your heart
You know Im only human
Its the call of the wild
Its the law of the jungle
Dont say no
Want to be with you wont you stay with me overnight
Give a little bit to you wont you stay with me stay
Pulling me to you wont you stay with me overnight
Itll be forever if you stay with me stay with me stay
Stay with me overnight stay
Stay with me overnight stay
Stay with me overnight stay
Stay with me stay
Stay with me stay
Stay with me stay
Want to be with you wont you stay with me overnight
Give a little bit to you wont you stay with me stay
Pulling me to you wont you stay with me overnight
Itll be forever if you stay with me stay with me stay
Want to be with you wont you stay with me overnight
Give a little bit to you wont you stay with me stay
Pulling me to you wont you stay with me overnight
Itll be forever if you stay with me stay with me stayYou know a love so fine so high above
Goes on forever but the road is rough
Reaching for another as truth will show
Try to live without it but you cant let go
We dont talk about it we got no doubt
We can love each other when the lights go out
I got nobody my bird has flown
Anyone can see Im walking alone
Walking alone
In your quiet moments in your silent prayer
Ill be with you baby Ill be there
In your darkest hour on your longest night
Ill be with you baby
Make it right
On your longest night
You know it breaks my heart and it hurts my pride
To know I lost you to the world outside
Feelings when you touch me they rise and fall
Try to live without it aint no love at all
We dont talk about it but somebody knows
We can love each other when the candle glows
Open my eyes and the moment is gone
Anyone can see Im walking alone
Walking alone
In your darkest hour on your longest night
Ill be with you baby
Make it right
Nobody cries
Nobody cries cries
For the pain I feel
Nobody knows nobody knows
And it makes me want to die
In your quiet moments in your silent prayer
Ill be with you baby Ill be there
In your darkest hour on your longest night
Ill be with you baby
Make it right
On your longest nightIve come home
Ive been away too long
But you dont want me back again
And I tried in the end
I cant say you made me very sad
The point of love is not to lie
Points denied in the end in the end
How can you tell me you dont want me
When Ive done all I can to save the day
Suppose Im in the way
In the end in the end in the end
You dont dont see sense eyes never cry
Please take part of me leave the rest to die
I cant say you made me very sad
The point of love is not to lie
Points denied in the end in the end
How can you tell me you dont want me
When Ive done all I can to save the day
Suppose Im in the way
In the end in the end
How can you tell me you dont want me
When Ive done all I can to save the day
Suppose Im in the way
In the end in the end in the endIn the event of something happening to me
There is something I would like you all to see
Its just a photograph of someone that I knew
Have you seen my wife Mr Jones
Do you know what its like on the outside
Dont go talking too loud youll cause a landslide Mr Jones
I keep straining my ears to hear a sound
Maybe someone is digging underground
Or have they given up and all gone home to bed
Thinking those who once existed must be dead
Have you seen my wife Mr Jones
Do you know what its like on the outside
Dont go talking too loud youll cause a landslide Mr Jones
In the event of something happening to me
There is something I would like you all to see
Its just a photograph of someone that I knew

Im a man on fire
Its a burning thing
Itll burn on forever
If you feed me baby
Im a man on fire
An eternal flame
Itll burn on forever
If you feed me baby oh
Gotta be a place to go in the midnight hour
Heart of a woman and just a little bit of pulling power
The feelings got me
I dont know what it means
I know it must be wrong
But when you love somebody you dream and I dream
I save the love down deep inside me for the moment when you come
And youre there and youre gone
And Im alive for you
And my love keeps hanging on
There is no life
No reason to go on believing in the stronger love
There is no unifying if I dont hear you crying
Im yours youre mine no power in the world
Together we are strong in love
And when your storm is over Ill show how warm my love can be
And me Im a man on fire
Chorus
Ready when the lightning strikes and he deed is done
Im not a beginner
But Im a sinner when the heat is on
Nothing gonna stop me got me all that you need
Woman when you need somebody
A woman with a face and a body you dream and I dream
I save the love down deep inside me for the moment when you come
And youre there and youre gone
And Im alive for you
And my love keeps hanging on
There is no life
No reason to go on believing in the stronger love
There is no unifying if I dont hear you crying
Im yours youre mine no power in the world
Together we are strong enough
And when your storm is over Ill show how warm my love can me
And me Im a man on fire
ChorusToday I saw the sun
To rise to fall but can you forgive me
I sail upon this mortal storm
And hearts that cry and love is to leave me
Were miles apart
I know my aim is true
It keeps this flame from dying
I just stay alive
Angel of mercy
I know that Ill find you
So its to my God in heaven that I pray
We can fly away
The voice is on the wind
I steal the stars the course I must follow
No space or time no sleep the soul
It lies awake it craves to be near you
It drives me on
I know my aim is true
It keeps my flame from dying
We might live again
Angel of mercy
I know that Ill find you
So its to my God in heaven that I pray
We can fly away
Sailing on a sea of gold
Where silver wings of angels go
I can see a million miles
That love goes on forever
Write a letter in the sand
That only lovers understand
And when the words are said and done
That we must come together
Sailing on a sea of gold
Where silver wings of angels go
I can see a million miles
That love goes on foreverJuliet
Robin Gibb
I steal the night away
Drivin my life away dancin
I was a romeo
I knew the art of romancin
I was just one of the guys
And I thought I had it made
I needed someone to show me how to love
Juliet oh Juliet
The night was magic when we first met
Juliet oh Juliet
You know you taught me to fly
You take me clear to the sky
And all the people around the world can stand aside
For me and my baby Juliet
Fighting with destiny fortune and fame but kept losing
Playin a jokers game
Only myself I was foolin
I was an average guy in a world of empty dreams
Youve broken down all the walls with your love
Juliet oh Juliet
This kind of lovin you dont forget
Juliet oh Juliet
You know you taught me to fly
You take me clear to the sky
And all the people around the world can stand aside
Close your eyes Juliet dont let go
On and on our love is like the sun
It keeps going strong throughout eternity
I want to love you in my life sweet Juliet
Livin without you in my life oh my girl Juliet
Juliet oh Juliet
This kind of lovin you dont forget
Juliet oh Juliet
You know you taught me to fly
You take me clear to the sky
And all the people around the world can stand aside
Juliet oh Juliet
This kind of lovin you dont forget
Juliet oh Juliet Ah
Juliet oh JulietWe set the same scene
Circumstances different than they
Might have been
People in two places can be
Pulled into a scheme
Never what youre fighting for
Life alone
Lose a lovers arms
Never makes it easy when you try too hard
I wish you would define what you feel
Hard on or letting go
Im the Omega Man
Stand tall and understand
Everybody needs a plan
Mine is a better way
Therell be trouble in the world
Sex and the single girl
Im an over-eager man
Find me a better way
Find me a better way
We share the same pain
Underneath the covers I will set you free
I will prove to you my love is
Older than the sky
Stronger than the night is long
Lord of hearts
Leader of us all
Let it be together if we rise or fall
Or is it just my imagination
Or the light of a precious stone
Youll never be alone
Im the Omega Man
I travel over land
Everybody needs a plan
Find me a better way
Therell be trouble in the world
Sex and the single girl
Im an over-eager man
Find me a better way
Find me a better way
Here at the scene of the crime
Laid in your arms I will die
I know its more than infatuation
Thats keeping this man alive
Im the Omega Man
Stand tall and understand
Everybody needs a plan
Mine is a better way
Therell be trouble in the world
Sex and the single girl
Im an over-eager man

She give me trouble enough
And shes a ball of light
Im in the tunnel of love
With the American dream
And I was born too soon
A little good luck never stuck
She got me climbing the walls
Got me hard as a rock
Within a city of sin she got a city block
And she was barkin at the moon
She likes to show
So many sides to her
And Id be the one to know
Chorus
When am I gonna go to your dimension
When am I gonna go to where you are
When am I gonna go to your dimension
Dimensions of each other keep us goin strong
Black knight take a bite
She can double it up
And shes a way of life
And whether dead or alive
She got a fix on me
And I was dancin in the fire
White steam never seen
In every muscle and bone
She was a love machine
And she could wrestle me down
And get a taste of me
In her web of desire
She changed my world
How can the body know
Its touchin me or her
ChorusStarlight summer nights
Dont leave me here alone to die
Someone somewhere cried
Oh starlight oh in my eyes
Too far away to see the lights
Drifters drifting by
Now youve come back again
And I aint over it yet
Please wont you walk with me
Talk with me
Starlight yeah
Starlight oh winter nights
The snow has come and love has gone
Now Im feeling cold
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Starlight oh in my eyes
Too far away to see the lights
And Im growing so old
Now youve come back again
And I aint over it yet
Please wont you walk with me
Talk with me
Starlight
Now youve come back again
And I aint over it yet
Please wont you walk with me
Talk with me
StarlightFourteenth of February eighteen ninety nine
The British ship Veronica was lost without a sign
Baa baa black sheep you havent any wool
Captain Richardson left himself a lonely wife in Hull
Cherub I lost a ship in the Baltic sea
Im on an iceberg running free
Sitting filing this berg to the shape of a ship
Sailing my way back to your lips
One passing ship gave word that you have moved out of your old flat
You love the Vicar more then words can say
Tell him to pray that I wont melt away
And Ill see your face again
Odessa How strong am I
Odessa How time goes by
Treasure you know the neighbors that live next door
They havent got their dog anymore
Freezing sailing around in the North Atlantic
Cant seem to leave the sea anymore
I just cant understand why you just moved to Finland
You love that Vicar more then words can say
Ask him to pray that I wont melt away
And Ill see your face again
Odessa How strong am I
Odessa How time goes by
Fourteenth of February eighteen ninety nine
The British ship Veronica was lost without a signWithout you stood alone on the edge of time
Out of sight but forever mine without you
Sometimes theres no forgetting the night
When you reach for the stars just to be where its bright
But you left me behind what a crazy goodbye
Without you there aint no love at all
And without you there aint no plans at all
Without you everythings lost to the wind
You were the love I was in
How can I try to be me
Without you
Without you watching you take the world from me
Leaving me with a memory about you
Sometimes theres no forgetting the place
Where you told me goodbye like a slap in the face
Where you tore me apart and I learned how to cry
Without you there aint no love at all
And without you there aint no plans at all
Without you everythings lost to the wind
You were the love I was in
How can I try to be me
Without youBarker sing me a song
Instead of counting trees
Collecting aeroplane numbers now mr barker
Live it up shine my shoes
Fly me to the moon
Never before have i seen the light mr barker
Then the moment of depression fell around mr barker
And the changes of expression to a frown my friend barker
There must be something there
Shiner of the light we demand we are here mr barker
Then the moment of depression fell around mr barker
And the changes of expression to a frown my friend barker
There must be something there
Shiner of the light we demand we are here mr barker
Barker sing me a song
Instead of counting trees
Collecting aeroplane numbers now mr barker
Live it up shine my shoes
Fly me to the moon
Never before have i seen the light
Barker sing me a song
Instead of counting trees
Collecting aeroplane numbers now mr barker
Live it up shine my shoes
Fly me to the moon
Never before have i seen the lightThere is not anything I would not do to ease your troubled mind
Where you are there is a different feeling
I wake up Im on the ceilin opens up your eyes
What a shape someone you cant forget for any time
Oh let me show you mine immediately
Chorus
After dark where the lights start fading sweet and low
I wanna be there I wanna be there
We leave immediately
After dark where the lights start fading sweet and low
I wanna be there I wanna be there
We leave immediately after dark
There is no limit that I would not go if I could lie beside
Where you are there is a different world out there
Love in the jungle can be hard to realize
What a shape someone you cant forget for any time
Oh let me show you mine immediately
Chorus
There is not anything I would not do to ease your troubled mind
Where you are there is a different feeling
I wake up Im on the ceilin opens up your eyes
What a shape someone you cant forget for any time
Oh let me show you mine immediately
ChorusHed sing his song most evry night
Wishing she was there behind the light
The people danced and sang along
On the cardboard stage he never sang it wrong
And the piper played the tune
And the drummer wore his spurs
But the song that the singer sang was for her
Now the singers song is never heard
And the visions he once saw are disappeared
Now they never dance or sing along
But on the cardboard stage he never sang it wrong
And the piper played the tune
And the drummer wore his spurs
But the song that the singer sang was for herOh I baby what a fool I am
First a boy and then a man am I
And you youre the heart of it all
Youre the things I say and do
Am I wasting my time hangin around
You would be gone
But I cant help it
Evry moment that I think about you
Evry day and evry night without you
I cant survive
Love take away the lonely days gone by
Make it evry day for you and I
Givin me the chance to go on believin
Girl you gotta go on believin
Boy you gotta go on believin
You baby youre the breathe I take
Coming for a heart in love am I
And you youre the heart of it all
Youre the things I say and do
Am I wasting my time hangin around
You would be gone
But I cant help it
Evry moment that I think about you
Evry day and evry night without you
I cant survive
Love take away the lonely days gone by
Make it evry day for you and I
Givin me the chance to go on believin
Girl you gotta go on believin
Boy you gotta go on believinWe may be big or small or black or white eternally
And black and white is you and me in a special light
We may be young or old or in between but this much I know
Together we can learn to grow
In a world thats ever turning its back on you
If you give it all away
Make it mine
You are desire
Everything you need I give you right or wrong
And you are the woman that I base my whole existence on
And when I get to you my desire is glowing in your light
These are the golden years we get to live we lead the way
tomorrow we can start today in a special light
Love could be good or bad or in between but this much I know
Baby you and I can learn
In a world thats rearranging its reality
If you give it all away
Make it mine
You are desire
Everything you need I give you right or wrong
And you are the woman that I base my whole existence on
And when I get to you my desire is glowing in your light
And its nice to light a fire when its cold outside
If you give it all away
Make it mine
You are desire
Everything you need I give you right or wrong
And you are the woman that I base my whole existence on
And when I get to you my desire is glowing in your light
You are desire
Everything you need I give you right or wrong
And you are the woman that I base my whole existence on
And when I get to you my desire is glowing in your lightIve been here all your life
Watching your crying game
You were the heaven in my lonely world
And he was your sun and your rain
I was losing you before I ever held you tight
Before you ever hold me in your arms
And I wont make you blue
And maybe an everlasting love will do
Ive got an everlasting love
So tall so wide so high
Above the rumble of thunder down below
Its your love I need
Its the only show
And its you on an everlasting dream
Can take us anywhere
Are the tears of yesterday
We killed the pain
We blew away the memories of the tears we cried
And an everlasting love will never die
Take me out of the cold give me what Ive waited for
If its the pleasure of taking my heart that you need
Then it only makes me love you more
I was yours before the stars were born
And you were mine
I could have saved you all the pain you knew
And I wont make you cry
And maybe an everlasting love can try
Ive got an everlasting love
So tall so wide so high
Above the rumble of thunder down below
Its your love I need
Its the only show
And its you on an everlasting dream
Can take us anywhere
Are the tears of yesterday
We killed the pain
We blew away the memories of the tears we cried
And an everlasting love will never dieWords and music make a song for our hearts to sing along
Like a choir within the air therell be music evrywhere
A bitter tear across your cheek
A smile from you is all I need
Well give them cause to breathe the air
Therell be lovers evrywhere
Ill be your singer and your song
for all the love youve brought along
Ill be your day Ill be your night
Ill see that evrythings all right
Ill turn the ocean into sand
Like my heart at your command
Ill make the raindrops turn to snow
And then evryone will know that were in love
Yeah yeah yeah
And when the morning brings its light
And Mister Moonlight says goodbye
My hand is shaking when you smile
You make me feel just like a child
My mind is searching for a way
so that you wont have to say
Youve got to go and cant come back
But I cant think youd make me sad
Ill be your singer and your song
for all the love youve brought along
Ill be your day Ill be your night
Ill see that evrythings all right
Ill turn the ocean into sand
Like my heart at your command
Ill make the raindrops turn to snow
And then evryone will know that were in love
Take away the pain in me
Ill be your singer and your song
Soon youll see a change in me
for all the love youve brought along
Whats the point of going on
Ill be your day Ill be your night
The story ends the feelings gone
Ill see that evrythings all right
Ill turn the ocean into sand
Like my heart at your command
Ill make the raindrops turn to snow
And then evryone will know that were in love
The story ends the feelings gone
Ill see that evrythings all right
Ill turn the ocean into sand
Like my heart at your command
Ill make the raindrops turn to snow
And then evryone will know that were in love

All about Andy Gibb httpwwwmusictorycommusicAndyGibbIm the sun Im the falling rain
Im the kind of man you cant explain
True love is one thing Ive been dreaming of
I give my love to you and when I do
You are to me the very deepest part of me
I am the world
I am the sky
I am the sea
Im anything that you want me to be
When you hurt me then I become the night time
The shadows in my eyes dont make it good for
Me to see the way I should
I am the world
I am the sky
I am the sea
Im anything that you want me to be
Im the sun Im the falling rain
Im the kind of man that you cant explain
I am the world
I am the worldFool in the night on the stair
With the light by the window
Out in the jungle of life she was
Yearning to go
All of the years Ive been there for the tears
She will sell you
Out in the city she search for the face
That she knew
Did you believe that a love so alive could be over
Chorus
Caroline
Fallen Angel
Caroline
Oh oh oh
Fallen Angel
Im so lost
Tonight lonely tonight
Lonely tonight
Fool is the father who clings to the
Child he is losing
Mother too weary to question
The wisdom of youth
There with your head in your handa
As you pray to her picture
Out in the rain she would search
For somebody to hold
Did you believe you could find
What you need with a stranger
Chorus
Did you believe that a love so alive could be over
Chorus
Caroline
Fallen AngelYou got me looking at that heaven in your eyes
I was chasing your direction
I was telling you no lies
And I was loving you
When the words are said baby I lose my head
And in a world of people theres only you and I
There aint nothing come between us in the end
How can I hold you when you aint even mine
Only you can see me through
I leave it up to you
Do it light taking me through the night
Shadow dancing baby you do it right
Give me more drag me across the floor
Shadow dancing all this and nothing more
All that I need is just one moment in your arms
I was chasing your affection
I was doing you no harm
And I was loving you
Make it shine make it rain baby I know my way
I need that sweet sensation of living in your love
I cant breath when youre away it pulls me down
You are the question and the answer am I
Only you can see me through
I leave it up to you
Do it light taking me through the night
Shadow dancing baby you do it right
Give me more drag me across the floor
Shadow dancing all this and nothing more
And in this world of people theres only you and I
There aint nothing come between us in the end
Ah can I hold you when you aint even mine
Only you can see me through
I leave it up to you
Do it light taking me through the night
Shadow dancing baby you do it right
Give me more drag me across the floor
Shadow dancing all this and nothing more
Do it light taking me through the night
Shadow dancing baby you do it right
Give me more drag me across the floor
Shadow dancing all this and nothing more
Do it light taking me through the night
Shadow dancing baby you do it right
Give me more drag me across the floor
Shadow dancing all this and nothing more
Do it light taking me through the night
Shadow dancing baby you do it right
Give me more drag me across the floor
Shadow dancing all this and nothing more
Do it light taking me through the night
Shadow dancing baby you do it right
Give me more drag me across the floor
Shadow dancing all this and nothing moreIve been around the world
Youll never know just how long Ive been praying
To get you into my life
It wont be long before you understand
Even our love becomes a master plan and so I
I think Im walking on air
So much in love I cant tell what Im saying
Therell be no running away
You and I wont be apart again
I know in my heart that we can start again
Wait for the summer
When loves in the air
You wont be sorry
You answered my prayer
I see the games that you play
And I dont care what the people are saying
No other love can compare
Just to hold you in my arms again
I feel like walking on air
And just to dream youll be there keeps me going
And all those days go by
We will never be apart again
Knowing our love will never die
Wait for the summer
When loves in the air
Well be together this time of the year
We will never be apart again
Knowing our love will never die
Here comes the summer
With love in the air love in the air
You wont be sorry
You answered my prayer answered my prayer
Here comes the summer
And everyones here everyones here
We will be sailing
Through year after year year after year
You know Im walking on air
I know Im walking on air
You know Im walking on airLove is higher than a mountain
Love is thicker than water
You are this dreamers only dream
Heavens angel devils daughter
Say my mind should I go with her on silent nights
Shell drive me crazy in the end
And I should leave this paradise
But I cant leave her
while I need her more then she needs you
Thats what Im living for
Love is higher than a mountain
Love is thicker than water
You are this dreamers only dream
Heavens angel devils daughter
Say my thought should I find out she dont care at all
Shell leave me crying in the end
Wandering through the afterglow
But I cant leave her
While I need her more then she needs you
Thats what Im praying for
Love is higher than a mountain
Love is thicker than water
You are this dreamers only dream
Heavens angel devils daughter
Love is higher than a mountain
Love is thicker than water
You are this dreamers only dream
Heavens angel devils daughterWhen I was young I dreamed of you
Far and away my dreams come true
Now I know what love has done
Children of mine we all are one
When I was young I looked to you
You were the world I never knew
Through the years we all have grown
Knowing your love forever strong
Would you walk away if I raised my voice
Do you think I taught you well
Time after time after time
In younger days I felt for you
With all the pain that we went through
We believe the one above
Father and Son forever love
Hand in hand the futures here
Now that we crossed the bridge of tears
Finding truth and facing fears
We can walk on the road is clear
Walk across the bridge
Take my hand
Walk across the bridge
Come to me
Would you walk away if I raised my voice
Do you think I taught you well
Time after time after time
Walk across the bridge
Come to me
Walk across the bridge
Youll never be far away
Youll never be far away
Youll never be far awayI feel at home in the country
And it makes me feel like Im happy
And my hands touch the sky
And I feel more alive than Ive ever known
Oh yeah
But you understand what Im feeling
And it makes me feel like were learning
And youve nothing to hide
cause youve shown it inside
And it says so much it does
But thats not me
Im not that man
I live for my world
And I do all I can come what may
With the night on our side we can dance to the light of the morning
With a sweet country song just to help things along oh baby
Well run hot and run cold till the night grows old
And were back in the dawn again
Youre the light of my life I rely on
And youre brighter than stars that I cry on
And youre closer to me than I think you should be
But I cant let go
But thats not me
Im not that man
I live for my world
And I do all I can come what may
With the night on our side we can dance to the light of the morning
With a sweet country song just to help things along oh baby
Well run hot and run cold till the night grows old
And were back in the dawn again
Whisper of the winds my only friend
With the night on our side we can dance to the light of the morning
With a sweet country song just to help things along oh baby
With the night on our side we can dance to the light of the morning
With a sweet country song just to help things along oh baby
With the night on our side we can dance to the light of the morning
With a sweet country song just o help things along oh babyHow can you tell by looking at me
How can you tell you like what you see
Suddenly theres a boy in the rain alone
Suddenly theres a girl in the rain alone
How can you humans are real
How can you tell you like what you feel
Suddenly theres a girl in your heart oh boy
Suddenly theres a boy in your heart oh boy
How can you tell by looking at me
How can you tell you like what you see
Suddenly theres a boy in the rain alone
Suddenly theres a girl in the rain aloneFirst you say you needed me
Then you give me sympathy
They say good girls never win
Something good in giving in
How do I get through to you
You must be made of stone
Just when I was safe and sound
Love you built a wall around
You take a hard line attitude
Time to send me back to school
Or take me take me to your
House of shame
Easy on your body when you got no name
Hold me like you know me
Im a falling star
Catch me if you can
Show me the way inside
You can knock on any door
I know what Im looking for
Red light hit and run
Time to turn the engine on
Pretty girl lives all alone
I must be going home
Hot as hell and cold as ice
Everything I sacrifice
I got to pick up on what you do
I just cant get over you
You take me take me to your
House of shame
Easy on your body when you got no name
Hold me like you know me
Im a falling star
Catch me if you can
Show me the way inside
Tell me what you really want from life
Loving you darling
You got me infatuated
Good love is not for sale
I nearly gave myself away
Pretty girl lives all alone
Take me to your take me to your
House of shame
Easy on your body when you got no name
Hold me like you know me
Im a falling star
Catch me if you can
Show me the way insideI aint got time only got a dime to make a last call
Im gettin soaking wet and it aint rained yet since last fall
I got myself a coach ticket on the Southern railroad line
I dont have to worry cause I know it never leaves on time
Late last night we made love and everything was all right
You walked out the door and the only thing I saw was the hall light
I got myself a coach ticket on the Southern railroad line
I dont have to worry cause I know it never leaves on time
Why didnt you see that you dont feel the same way as I do
I understood before that you couldnt take much more as I knew
I got myself a coach ticket on the Southern railroad line
I dont have to worry cause I know it never leaves on timeThere are times that I should go away
To think of you and I
For it isnt only now I need your love
All of my life all of my life
In the night time when I lie awake
And think of you in my heart
For it isnt only now I need your love
All of my life all of my life
Oh wouldnt you believe me if I told you
That I love you and I do
Everyone believes me when I tell them
Why dont you why dont you
When I think of things that ought to be
And I feel your hand in mine
Yes it isnt only now I need your love
All of my life all of my life
All of my life all of my life
Oh wouldnt you believe if I told you
That I love you and I do
Everyone believes me when I tell them
Why dont you why dont you
When I think of things that ought to be
And I feel your hand in mine
Yes it isnt only now I need your love
All of my life all of my life
All of my life Repeat If youre lonely in the black of night
If you call me Ill be there
I was falling and you helped me get it right
And I thank you girl and I thank you
And I pray for the sign
And I wont be too late
If you just come down
I can look you in the eye
I can tell you that I love you
And my love will never die
And its time that you know
Just how far I mean to go
We fly rings around the moon
We fly rings around the moon
We fly rings around the moon
We fly rings around the moon
Come tomorrow candle burns
And I wake up by your side
All my sorrow you made it disappear
And I thank you and I thank you
And I lay down my life
And I wont be alone
If you just take time
And be sure of who you are
We can take it up to heaven
We can walk amongst the stars
And I know if you stay
I will never turn away
We fly rings around the moon
We fly rings around the moon
We fly rings around the moon
We fly rings around the moon
And I pray for the sign
And I wont be too late
If you just take time
And be sure of who you are
We can take it up to heaven
We can walk amongst the stars
And I know if you stay
I will never turn away
We fly rings around the moon
We fly rings around the moon
We fly rings around the moon
We fly rings around the moonYou got to walk a little slower when youre with her
Take the time to be tender thats the plan
You got to stand a little taller while her world falls to pieces
Only then can you hold her in your hand
You got to live for every moment that she gives you
Make the one in a million understand
You got to stand a little taller while her world falls to pieces
Only then can you hold her in your hand
Now too many faces have come down between us
And I was the fool to be
And I cant deny you the wide open spaces
As long as she stops loving me
You got to stand a little closer when you hold her
Make her feel like a woman understand
You got to stand a little taller while her world falls to pieces
Only then can you hold her in your handI just dont understand
How love became your problem
Hearts that should not cry
No words are missing but its not understood
Its time to take me back to school
So fine just as you are
I could be the life you save
Ill be there when you need your
World of girls and boys think about the kill before you draw the bow
And cut me low
Like an Arrow through the heart arrow through the heart oh
arrow through the heart arrow through the heartbreak and the pain
Never smiling in the rain
Never to be seen again nothing makes you die
Like an arrow through the heart
High flying bird you can never love nobody
But I will not lose my dream
Birds of a feather they are never outflown
I guess the sky is beautiful
But an arrow through the heart arrow through the heart oh
arrow through the heart
arrow through the heart break over you steady hand your aim is true
Bring me to my knees again
Im too young to die
Im too young to die
My silver moon
My golden sun
World of girls and boys think about the kill before you draw the bow
And cut me low
Like an arrow through the heart arrow through the heart oh
Arrow through the heart arrow through the heartYouve got a plan that could never go wrong
You took advantage and the damage done
It all comes back to me baby
It all comes back to me
I played the fool and I went off the track
And when I think of all it cost
When the dice was cast
You know I had to be crazy
You know I had to be
Ive been telling lies
And you forgive me but my heart still cries
And you can understand
Im just the man in the middle
Of a complicated plan
No one to show me the signs
Im just a creature of habit
In a complicated world
Nowhere to run to
Nowhere to hide to hide to hide to hide
I know I let you down in so many ways
I know that sorry doesnt tell you
What you need me to say
But I would die for you baby
Yes I would die for you
Ive been in disguise
And you forgive me and our love will rise
And you can understand
Im just the man in the middle
Of a complicated plan
No one to show me the light
Ahyes Im weary from battle
But Ive just begun to fight
Nowhere to run to
Nowhere to hide
Im just the man in the middle
Of a complicated plan
No one to show me the signs
Im just a creature of habit
In a complicated world
Nowhere to run to
Nowhere to hide to hide to hide
Im just the man in the middle
Of a complicated plan
No one to show me the light
Ah yes Im weary from battle
But Ive just begun to fight
Nowhere to run to
Nowhere to hide
Im just the man in the middle
The only man
The fool of a man in the middle
Nowhere to run to
Nowhere to hide
Im just the man
The only man
That stupid man
Nowhere to run to
Nowhere to hide to hide to hideI dont know what you want I dont hear what you said
Truth behind the lies
Cause I cant see whats in your head
And spread your wings and fly out in a brave new world
Let this be my prayer to keep you safe when Im not there
Can we love and live apart
I dont know no I dont know
How can we divide the heart
I dont know no I dont know
And when the night falls and when the sky falls
I long for your embrace
And in the cold night under the street light
I long for your embrace
Living separate lives I have faith in you away from you I have faith
Like a lonely child I will hang on every word
Embrace
Through the mists of time lovers can be friends
The power of the human heart
The secrets in the souls of men
All my blessings in disguise
I dont know no I dont know
Reunited we will rise
I dont know no I dont know
And when the night falls and when the sky falls
I long for your embrace
And in the cold night under the street light
I long for your embrace
Living separate lives I have faith in you away from you I have faith
Like a lonely child I will hang on every word
And when the night falls and when the sky falls
I long for your embrace
Another daybreak another heartache
I long for your embrace
Living separate lives
Away from you
Embrace embrace
The lonely lonely life
Lonely days and nights away from you
We can live our life
embrace embrace
With our separate lives
Embrace embrace
The lonely lonely lives
Lonely days and nights
I will never send away
Embrace embrace
The lonely lonely lives
Embrace the child inside
The lonely lonely livesThis is my swan song
Whatever I do now I do it well
This is my swan song
I fell in love with you I love you well
And if the Lord provides the music for the world around to sing
My love will build a castle in the air
This is my last chance
A chance to show the world that I am strong
This is my last dance
Im walking off the floor where I belong
And if the Lord provides the music for the world around to sing
My love will build a castle in the air
And if the Lord provides the music for the world around to sing
My love will build a castle in the airMust be a thousand million times Ive seen your face in laughter
And evry time meant something new to me
But being broke and living low
I sensed what you were after
And time has said get out before you bleed
Oh with every second glance you killed my pride
And evry second tear
You held my life in your hands
And you never knew of all the things you could do
If you wanted to
Too many looks in your eyes breaking my heart
And I dont want to start fighting with words that somebody heard
Tell me what they really mean to you
Too many thoughts on your mind
And its easy to see youre thinking of me
And still you remain so perfectly sane
Too many looks in your eyes
Ive often thought of things Id do if I had money
But moneys always been my dream to me
But evry time I saw that face those riches never mattered
To have you close was wealth enough for me
Imagination stopped where life began
And I had always felt a little lost in your love with no way through
But you could pull me through if you wanted to
Too many looks in your eyes breaking my heart
And I dont wanna start fighting with words that somebody heard
Tell me what they really mean to you
Too many thoughts on your mind
And its easy to see youre thinking of me
And still you remain so perfectly sane
Too many looks in your eyes
With every second glance you killed my pride
And evry second tear you held my life in your hands
And you never knew of all the things you could do
If you wanted to
Too many looks in your eyes breaking my heart
And I dont wanna start fighting with words that somebody heard
Tell me what they really mean to you
Too many thoughts on your mind
And its easy to see youre thinking of me
And still you remain so perfectly sane
Ah yeah
Too many looks in your eyes breaking my heart
And I dont wanna start fighting with words that somebody heard
Tell me what they really mean to you
Too many thoughts on your mind
And its easy to see youre thinking of me
And still you remain so perfectly sane
Ah yeahCountry women now what you gonna do with your life
Country women now why dont you get out of this life
Leave my life alone
The first time I met you I knew you were the devils daughter
You came on like a river doin all the things you oughta
Youre a self made women baby not a made-to-order
If you had your way I know youd make me stay
And that would only bring me down
Country women now what you gonna do with your life
Country women now why dont you get out of this life
Leave my life alone
Country women country women country women
Country women country women ahh
Country women now what you gonna do with your life
Country women now why dont you get out of this life
Leave my life alone
Leave my life alone
Country women now country women now country women now
Country women now country women now country women nowWoman in a million to me
Ive never loved so much
Is it any wonder Im alive
No one ever knows what makes a
Virtue or a vice
Let it be the spell Im under
These naked eyes
Let it be the rain and thunder comes
I go above and beyond the sun
Some love never dies
Story of our lives oh
Swear by the stars above
And late at night I pray to myself
That you and I got everything we need
Id give it all for you and me
Love is the earth and the wind
And the fire and the soul
Love is above and beyond any eye to behold
Love is the key and the cause
And its makin us whole
Made me a little crazy but I
Soon realize my fate
Every little touch Im paralized
No one ever knows what makes
An angel in disguise
Let me be the one to taste you
Those naked eyes
No pity if the city ever crumbles down
I go above and beyond the sun
Some love never dies
Story of our lives oh
Swear by the stars above
And late at night I pray to myself
That you and I got everything we need
Id give it all for you and me
Love is the earth and the wind
And the fire and we share
Love is the force and the edge
And its ready for those who dare
Love is above and beyond
And Im taking you there
And baby Ill take you there
I go above and beyond the sun
Some love never dies
Story of our lives ohh
Swear by the stars above
And late at night I pray to myself
That you and I got everything we need
Id give it all for you and me
Love is the earth and the wind
And the fire and the soul
Love is the key and the cause
And its making us whole
Love is the force and the edge
And its yours if you dare
Love is above and beyond
And Im taking you there
Baby Ill take you there
I go above and beyond the sun
Some love never dies
Story of our lives oh
Swear by the stars above
And late at night I pray to myself
That you and I got everything we need
Id give it all for you and meIm packing my bags and goin home
Ive been here too long
So happy Ill get there on my own
Mmm
Been here for reasons right or wrong
So Im packing my bags and Im goin home
So Ill walk by the railroad anytime anytime
Walk by the railroad anytime
Tell my brother and sister
That evrythings gone wrong
But Ill walkin by that railroad til Im home
Theres been lies told in my story
But theyve produced none of that glory
Cause Im walkin by that railroad til Im home
So Ill walkin by that railroad til Im home
Tell my woman that I miss her
That I cant wait to kiss her
So Im walkin by that railroad til Im home
Theres been lies told in my story
But theyve produced none of that glory
But still Ive served my time
And theres no use in cryin
Cause Im walkin by that railroad til Im home
So Im walkin by that railroad til Im homeThe stage is set another show must go on
The spotlights burning down into my face
The drummer sits up high upon his rostrum
Guitarists play each other face to face
And when its over Ill stop and wonder
And never understand
Cause leaving this was never in my plans
And when Im playing all I see is things youll never find
Flowing rivers passing through my mind
Deceiving and receiving was my past time
To every girl who liked my written lines
Theyd think that any moment Id be their guy
But crying never justified my lies oh no
And next time round will be the same
They never understand that hurting them was never in my plans
My songs will flow like passing clouds
Something in each line
Flowing rivers passing through my mind
Ive got to go Ive finished what I came for
Playing every city state to state
Singing every town that learned to like me
Modest payments paid for what I ate
Ah youre standing there tears in your eyes
You once called me a man
And loving you was never in my plans
Well go together you and I till we both find
Flowing rivers passing through my mind
Well go together you and I till we both find
Flowing rivers passing through my mindTime it goes on waits for nobody special
In the prime of my life Ill remember you
Livin and breathin and some misbelievin
But I cant hold you women no piece of you
You were the magic my only believer
My life on the line for you
All that I give to you
Time is time
Dont give me no time to waste away
Love is love
Keep me alive to my dying day
Now is now
We capture the world
And love will make it all right all right
Time it goes on waits for nothing on over
But I still see your sun that you shine on me
Giving and taking and always mistakin
But Ill follow you women eternally
You were the magic my only believer
My life on the line for you
All that I give to you
Time is time
Dont give me no time to waste away
Love is love
Keep me alive to my dying day
Now is now
We capture the world
And love will make it all right all right
Setting my sights in one only direction
Searching for romance and showing affection
I guess I better know one standing in the cold dark
Waiting for your love
Time is time
Dont give me no wrong in makin love
Love is love turn me around till you burn me up
Now is now we master the world
And time will make it all right all right
Time is time
Dont give me no wrong in makin love
Love is love turn me around till you burn me up
Now is now we master the world
And time will make it all right all right
Time is time
Dont give me no wrong in makin love
Love is love turn me around till you burn me up
Now is now we master the world
And time will make it all right all right
Time is time
Dont give me no wrong in makin love
Love is love turn me around till you burn me up
Now is now we master the world
And time will make it all right all rightDont shed a tear for me
No its not your style
If youre not here by me
Then its not worth while
Chorus
My world is our world
And this world is your world
And your world is my world
And my world is your world is mine
Ive been crying
Im lonely
What do I do to have you stay
Ive needed you
To cry on
Ive written you nearly evry day
Chorus
Dont shed a tear for me
Thats not your style
If youre not here by me
Then its not worth while
ChorusAh
Evry days saturday feeling in steadily
Laughing at people with stars in their eyes
Vicker hays approaching town preaching in the underground
Talking with the lambs who came out of the sky
You know how sir geoffrey saved the world
You know how sir geoffrey saved the world
Dinner time anytime see a crown should be mine
Evryones grabbing but no one will get
Sunny day should i care taking in the garden air
Evryones happy though no one can see
You know how sir geoffrey saved the world
You know how sir geoffrey saved the world
Ah
You know how sir geoffrey saved the world
You know how sir geoffrey saved the world
Evry days saturday feeling in steadily
Laughing at people with stars in their eyes
Vicker hays approaching town preaching in the underground
Talking with the lambs who came out of the sky
You know how sir geoffrey saved the world
You know how sir geoffrey saved the world
You know how sir geoffrey saved the worldHed sing his song most evry night
Wishing she was there behind the light
The people danced and sang along
On the cardboard stage he never sang it wrong
And the piper played the tune
And the drummer wore his spurs
But the song that the singer sang was for her
Now the singers song is never heard
And the visions he once saw are disappeared
Now they never dance or sing along
But on the cardboard stage he never sang it wrong
And the piper played the tune
And the drummer wore his spurs
But the song that the singer sang was for herThere is someone
Walking behind you
turn around look at me
There is someone
Watching your footsteps
turn around look at me
There is someone
Says they loves you
Heres my heart in my hand
Turn around look at me understand
There is someone
Standing beside you
Turn around turn around
Look at me look at me
There is someone
To love and guide you
Turn around turn around
Look at me look at me
Ill be waiting
for now and forever
for you to come to me
Turn around look at me
turn around look at meI can think of younger days when living for my life
Was everything a man could want to do
I could never see tomorrow
But I was never told about the sorrow
How can you mend a broken heart
How can you stop the rain from falling down
How can you stop the sun from shining
What makes the world go round
How can you mend a this broken man
How can a loser ever win
Please help me mend my broken heart and let me live again
I can still feel the breeze that rustles through the trees
And misty memories of days gone by
We could never see tomorrow
No one said a word about the sorrow
And how can you mend a broken heart
How can you stop the rain from falling down
How can you stop the sun from shining
What makes the world go round
And how can you mend this broken man
How can a loser ever win
Please help me mend my broken heart and let me live again
La la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la
Please help me mend my broken heart and let me live again
Da da da da
Da da da da da da da da da daIm full of pride and my heart feels good
Got news from my family up in the woods
At last I can go back where I belong
Sweated it all out for nine long years
Couldnt believe the voice in my ears
When the man saying no hiding son
So I left the only folks I had known
I was fifteen then hardly grown
When they found me in the swamp face down in the mud
Couldnt get back and I couldnt go far
Said to myself stay right where you are
Done found yourself a ma and pa
Chorus
Everybody said the kids no good
Come home johnny bride come home
Johnny bride come home
Were all wrong without you
How did we ever doubt you
He confessed to the killing
Its his role we had you filling
We didnt really mean to make you sad
But when you ran you made us think that you were twice as bad
I left the only folks I had known
I was fifteen then hardly grown
When they found me in the swamp face down in the mud
Couldnt get back and I couldnt go far
Said to myself stay right where you are
Done found yourself a ma and pa
Chorus
But when you ran you made us think that you were twice as bad RepeatsIf your mind is in the darkness could you know
If it suits you to be fast or far too slow
Will you show me someone who may treat me kind
Or is this world I live in just a frame of mind
And as soon as you discover where youre goin
Can I walk along the way along the way
Im lonesome and I need somebody knowin
Just a few nice words to get me through the day
If your mind is in the darkness could you know
If it suits you to be fast or far too slow
And will you show me someone who may treat me kind
Or is this world just a frame of mind
If youre living in Chicago its your home
If youre living in Chicago youre alone
If youre living in Chicago its your home
If youre living in Chicago youre alone
If youre living in Chicago youre alone Repeat 
If youre living in Chicago its your homeI cry tears of emotion to spread across the USA
Aint no sunshine cowboy in your pockets
Ill make my own way
While I play
Baby you forgot your living
Someone covered up your eyes
In my way at least Im giving what I love
Am I wise
Theres gonna be some confusion
And theres gonna be a day
Youll raise your eyes and youll look to the skies
And youll pray while I play
I am my fathers son or that is what I heard
Maybe I got it wrong
I didnt mean a word
You got my face and Ill play your ace
Pretend I havent heard
Theres gonna be some confusion
And theres gonna be a day
Youll raise your eyes and youll look to the skies
And youll pray while I play
I am a minstrel that is all I want to be
Ill play inside your soul
Ill show you to yourself
Fill your head with wild emotions
A symphony in wealth
Theres gonna be some confusion
And theres gonna be a day
Youll raise your eyes and youll look to the skies
And youll pray while I play
I will take my leave I gotta move on time
I played inside your soul made you sing along
I will return to find out if the melody was wrong
Theres gonna be some confusion
And theres gonna be a day
Youll raise your eyes and youll look to the skies
And youll pray while I playAll of a sudden I saw a new morning
Im locked up I want to be free
Out in the courtyard and over the wall then
My friends are waiting for me
Sixteen people are waiting to get me
Hoping to take me outside
I hear the sound of the snubnose behind me
I went along for the ride
Wind in my face and my bones they are aching
My soul must weather the storm
I must run till my back it is breaking
Despratly I must keep on
Sixteen people are waiting to get me
Hoping to take me outside
I hear the sound of the snubnose behind me
I went along for the ride
La
All of a sudden I saw a new morning
I went along for the ride
All of a sudden I saw a new morning
All of a sudden I saw a new morning
All of a sudden I saw a new morning
I saw a new morning repeat three more times The sun shines down on a South Dakota morning
And I can see their faces in my eyes
I wish they were behind me
My enemy can find me
If only to remind me that Im really not alone
All the South Dakota mornings I have known
The eagle flies on a South Dakota morning
And I dont see my eagle anymore
Now stranger I must kill you
You must survive but will you
I may just beat you down but will it even up the score
I think I saw the eagle just once more
The rain comes down on a South Dakota morning
And I cant see the sadness in my town
So let it be my pillow for underneath your willow
Want to go back to you though your nothing but a town
On the South Dakota grass I lay me downIve played the game still its not worth it
Like a woman in the rain
I close my eyes
Im on the shelf
I know myself
Ive seen the lights of every city
Tried to work out where I am
I close my mind for the day
I know the way
Ive played the game still its not worth it
Like a woman in the rain
So I close my eyes
Im on the shelf
I know my self
Theres never ever anybody to rely on
There isnt time to count the shoulders I have cried on
Thats just circumstances I must take my chances
But baby you dont know what Im saying
But I guess thats not true
And you know thats true
But theres a method to my madnessIts too late to turn back now
There aint no space back there
And how did I begin to lose my self control
How did I begin to lose my self control
There aint a thing that you could give me
With the love forever with me
Thats the only thing that satisfies my soul
Thats the only thing that satisfies my soul
Chorus
I dont want to be the one
Remember it was only fun
Two strangers touching in the sun it had to end
I dont want to be the guy to tell you things that make you cry
You know as well as I know youre my only friend
There aint a thing that you could give me
With the love forever with me
Thats the only thing that satisfies my soul
Thats the only thing that satisfies my soul
Chorus
I dont want to be the guy to tell you things that make you cry
You know as well as I know youre my only friend
You know as well as I know youre my only friend
Youre my only friend
My only friend
My only friendSweet simple song of different lights and different shades
The sound of life erupts and fades and all the world must play along
My life has been a song
Here as I sleep the love I dream will gently creep
Inside my heart I softly keep the tune that plays too long
My life has been a song
Every sound in my head every word that I said is like a melody melody
That no little person like me could ever change
Every sound in the street all the cold and the heat
Is like a symphony symphony
Which has never before been rearranged
Sweet simple song of different lights and different shades
The sound of life erupts and fades and all the world must play along
My life has been a song
Every sound in my head every word that I said is like a melody melody
That no little person like me could ever change
Every sound in the street all the cold and the heat
Is like a symphony symphony
Which has never before been rearranged
Sweet simple song of different lights and different shades
The sound of life erupts and fades and all the world must play along
My life has been a song
Every sound in my head every word that I said is like a melody melody
That no little person like me could ever change
Every sound in the street all the cold and the heat
Is like a symphony symphony
Which has never before been rearrangedHello Im down take me for this weekend
Im yours to borrow tomorrow good friend
And while Im away all my love Ill send
And thank you every Thursday for this weekend
Hello sunrise I must see your eyes
Still I will shout but theyre bound to find me out
Hello Im down take me for this weekend
Im yours to borrow tomorrow good friend
And Im yours to borrow tomorrow good friendIts the midnight hour and I with you were here
Somebody following me I just cant sleep alone
I figure its the way I am or a thing that
Happened to me somewhere in my childhood
Im all that I could ever be in your arms
Its like I cant imagine life without you
But all my women cry
And all my heroes die or we could try a little
Moonlight madness
We could do the strangest things
Try a little moonlight madness
Let someone in your dreams
Or we could try a little moonlight madness
Living on the same old lies
We should not try to find the meaning
Let history decide
Whether its right or wrong to give you
What I may give you
How we learn to do the things we never do
Let me try a little moonlight madness on you
I cry with a smile and I laugh with a tear
I struggle but the body wont move
And the quicksand pulls me down
I wanna be the man that you think I am
I follow in the steps of the one
Who knows the darkness well
And you can get me by your side
By talking to me with your eyes
Not breaking promises
Im howling at the moon
Im howling howling at the moon
Or we could try a little
Moonlight madness
We could do the strangest things
Try a little something different
The mystery remains
Whether its right or wrong to love each other
Yearning in the brain for something new
Let me try a little moonlight madness
Try a little moonlight madness
Try a little moonlight madness on you
Try a little moonlight madness
Let someone in your dreamsIn the morning when the moon is at its rest
You will see me at the time I love the best
Watching rainbows play on sunlight
Pools of water iced from cold nightin the morning

In the daytime I will meet you as before
You will find me waiting by the ocean floor
Building castles in the shifting sands
In a world that no one understands
In the morning

In the morning of my life the
Minutes take so long to drift away
Please be patient with your life
Its only morning and youre still to live your day
In the evening I will fly you to the moon
To the top right hand corner of
The ceiling in my room
Where Ill stay until the sun shines
Another day to swing on clothes lines
May I be yawningIn the morning when the moon is at its rest
you will see me at the time I love the best
watching rainbows play on sunlight

With my feathers of power I laugh as the hours go slowly by
That could mean everything
I am a street watching the people walk
As I listen their conversations glisten as they start to talk
Then I hear everything
Little white jug me and Kilburn Towers
As we sit on the hill and we drink and we swill
Till the early hours
Then I am everything
Little white jug and me and Kilburn Towers
That could mean everything
Little white jug me and Kilburn Towers
As we sit on the hill and we drink and we swill
Till the early hours
Then I am everythingRed chair fade away
Bring back memories
Think of something nice
Fragrant lemon trees
I can feel the speaking sky
I dont want to know
Its filling up the air
Grandpas fairy tale
Red chair round the fire
Rainbows all the time
Were all going higher
I can feel the speaking sky
I dont want to know
Its filling up the air
Red chair fade away Repeat 
Bring back memories
Think of something nice
Fragrant lemon trees
I can feel the speaking sky
I dont want to know
Its filling up the air
Red chair fade away
Red chair fade awayWhen I was you we walked to school
And I carried your books cause even then I was a fool
But you grew up and said goodbye
I still remember the things that made me cry
For all too soon my story ends
I found a love now not even friends
Tell me why
Loving you loving me like you used to do
I was the child
I held your hand and I told you things
And I made you believe believe in fairy tales
And diamond rings
Hen all too soon my story ends
I found a love now not even friends
Tell me why
Loving you loving me like you used to do
I was the child
AhI never ask for any time from you baby
I never ask for any lies
You only hurt the one you love the most baby
You only had to make me cry
Cause you left me you left me all alone you left me
You left meyou left me to stand alone
And every night I sit beside my bed baby
And I keep thinking of your love
The things we dreamed about
How much I love you baby
We had the world and the stars above
But then you left me you left me all aloneyou left me
You left me You left me you left me to stand alone
You left me to stand alone
You left me to stand alone
You left me You left me You left me You left meAll day all night you feel as if the earth could fly
Three more all for fine Indian Gin and whiskey dry
Fine Indian Gin and whiskey dry
Small town closed down
Theres nowhere else around to try
Disturbingly a voice would cry
Go home no loan
Youll have you gin and whiskey dry
Youll have your gin and whiskey dry
Four ten four men lining up for their handy brandy
Alls gone youre none came the bartenders reply
But Ive tried and Im tied to Indian Gin and whiskey dry
To Indian Gin and whiskey dry Repeat I must be crazy they dont know what weve done
You are my lover even though I know its wrong
I hear them talking but whatever they do
I need to love you and if I love you couldnt we make it
I got someone loving me he wont say goodbye
Hes been so good to me I dont wanna make him cry
I need you both to love me its up to you
You can help me youre the reason I cant decide
Breakin my bones and shakin my nerves
I just cant see tomorrow
Looking at him and looking at you
And I dont know who to follow
Ill never win in the state Im in
Its a crime of passion Im bad to love you
Whenever Im with you I lose control
Its a crime of passion for me and for you
Whatever I give its just too late to save my soul
I need to love you my desperation is the power to go on
Each night I prayed for love
Im at the mercy of and if you dont hear me now
Then Ill be the only one
Dont wanna be dont wanna be the only one
I saw him yesterday the questions he asked
I think he knows about us did we move too fast
How can we hide it when we know its a lie
Keep our love under the covers the pressure is too high
Why do I get myself tied up
Why tangle with love you borrow
I should have been known as a one man woman
Should have been one love but oh no
Never be a cure for the human law
Its a crime of passion Im bad to love you
Whenever Im with you I lose control
Its a crime of passion for me and for you
Whatever I give you its just too late to save my soul
I need to love you my desperation is the power to go on
Each night I prayed for love
Im at the mercy of and if you dont hear me now
Then Ill be the only one
Dont wanna be dont wanna be the only one
Its a crime of passion to love you
Whenever Im with you I lose control lose control
Its a crime of passion for me and for you
Whatever I give youWould you believe me if I told you your tomorrow is my yesterday
But be alive I know that we will
The world keeps on moving but Im holding still
In the beginning I was far away and praying for my destiny
That would arrive the moment youre born
For we will be here when the miracle comes
Chorus
Living eyes when under the sun dont cry
No war in my mind
The state of my heart
Living eyes when out in the rain will fall
The day I deny the face of my love
Bridge
We are of age we are in time we are forever
Right now when the power is mine
I leave you Heaven and the Earth I leave you never
And living to love is the reason to shine
I been over I been under I dont own a dream to analyze
But living eyes you know that I do
Believe in the soul and the magic of you
Chorus
Bridge
ChorusYou say you dont need me
I know where your love goes
You go missing after midnight
I should know better and the bed is cold
And if you think Im not the real thing
I dont want to die of hunger
I got my world created for you
But you dont stay
Not my imagination no more
I cant be dealing with the bad girl
Lives in your head
You got your someone I dont cry
You go and take a strangers love instead
Over you is where I should be
I could be loving you too much
Under me is where you should be
I could be loving you too much
You know I love the way you do it
When you do it right
You aint no one man woman
Were you ever
If you dont come back running
When youve had enough
And baby you got it I want it
Show me whats left of your love
Over you is where I should be
I could be loving you too much
Under me is where you should be
I could be loving you too much
I wont be no dirty weekend

Just let me hold you for the hour
I go where you lead me
I need some inspiration from you
Im ready for the mystery take me
Dont let me fall
Dont let me drown down here in the rain
There is no alibi dont lie
You love a stranger and the world is pain
Over you is where I should be
I could be loving you too much
Under me is where you should be
I could be loving you too much
Too much too much
Too much too much

You told me you thought our love could last forever forever
And I was the one that gave you all my love when I thought
That our love could last forever forever
I lay down and die the whole world joins in
And everyone cries as teardrops begin
I lay down and die
And when darkness falls cant see nothin at all
I lay down and die the whole world joins in
I lay down and die the teardrops begin
I lay down and die and die and dieEvry time we kiss I feel that somethings missing inside
Evry little glow for me has simply died
What has happened to the love
Happened to the love the love we knew
Baby Im losing you losing you baby Im losing you
Even in my sleep I feel the heartache creep in my dream
All the love you had for me is gone it seems
Oh what have you done to me
Made it plain to see that we are through
Baby Im losing you losing youbaby Im losing you
I hate to say goodbye to you
But darling what am I to do
Just a toy to play when you are through you throw away
Not me
If you dont need me now Ill get along somehow in my pain
Wish little boy go find another toy for your games
And whats happening to me Ill get by you see
Now we are through
Baby Im losing you losing you baby Im losing you
Baby Im losing you losing you baby Im losing youHave you heard what they say to me
They say our love could never be
They say that we are much too young to be
They say that I will go away and she will cry
And she will cry
They say that we are much too young to fall
Its just that they dont understand thats all
That we are one oh we are one
Because I want her so bad and I cant live without her
Want her so bad I know Ill never doubt her
She is my love
I want it all tonight
They say that we will never see the stars
But they cant see the stars are really ours
For they dont know
The just dont know
Some day well go and run so far away
To prove that we dont care what people say
And youll be mine
And youll be mine
Because I want her so bad and I cant live without her

She is my love
I want it all tonight
Because I want her so bad and I cant live without her
Want her so bad I know Ill never doubt her
She is my love

OohYou were a lovely child
And your hair was like the morning sun
And i knew we were in love
We were alone to dream a dream
We held our love that held our hearts
And who are we who knew
All there was in life and coming through
And every lonely sad mistake
Every change and interchange we make
We held our love and that held our hearts
Until until ohI never fell in love so easily
Where the four winds blow I carry on
Id like to take you where my spirit flys
Through the empty skys
We go alone never before having flown
Faster than lightning is this heart of mine
In the face of time I carry on
Id like to take you where my rainbow ends
Be my lover friend
We go alone never before having flown
I am your hurricane
Your fire in the sun
How long must I live in the air
You are my paradise
My angel on the run
How long must I wait
Its the dawn of the feeling
That starts from the moment youre there
Youll never know what you have done for me
You broke all those rules I live upon
Id like to take you to my shangrila
Neither here or far away from home
Never before having flown
There Id like to take you where my spirit flys
Through the empty skys we go alone
Never before having flownI been thinking sitting on a pole
Im getting sick of doing what Im told
Just me and the mirror and my brain
But that was when I got an idea
Came like a gun and shot in my ear
Dont you think its time you got up and stood alone
Fifteen years I lay down on the ground
I couldnt feel any noise or hear any sound
Fifteen million years I spent down the line
But that was when I got an idea
Came like a gun and shot in my ear
Dont you think its time you got up and stood alone
Get up and stand alone
That was when I got an idea
Came like a gun and shot in my ear
Dont you think its time you got up and stood alone
Get up and stand alone
Thats when I got an idea Repeat He may take you to shows evry night
Fill your head with promise and music delight
And shower you with kisses of sweet ecstasy
But hell never need you
He may fly you for weekends away
Get your kicks in paris and drive to calais
Life is so romantic youre feeling alive
Hell only leave you
Living so exciting with your love affair
Your heart has made you blind to me
Im sorry but Im wondering
Please answer me
Can he love you like I love you
Can he take you through the night
Will he get you through the heartaches
And tomorrow hold you tight
You may still survive the storm but
He cant love you baby he dont love you baby
Like I do
Down the champs-elysee for some french cuisine
Youre lookin like a model from some magazine
And down to monte carlo for champagne on ice
Yes its so inviting
Your head is spinning youre floating on air
Your heart is beating but youre not aware
The things that he told you were only a lie
And hell only hurt you
Living so exciting with your love affair
Your heart has made you blind to me
Im sorry but Im wondering
Please answer me
Can he love you like I love you
Can he take you through the night
Will he get you through the heartaches
And tomorrow hold you tight
You may still survive the storm but
He cant love you baby he dont love you baby
Like I do
Can he know just what youre thinkin
When you dont have words to say
You may never understand that
He cant love you baby
Can he love you like I love you
Can he take your heart away
Will he get you through the heartaches
And tomorrow hold you tight
You may still survive the storm fade out I started a song as I walked down maypole mews
She lives down there
She cant refuse to hearing my song
I started a song as I walked down maypole mews
She lives down there
She cant refuse to hearing my song
Maypole mews wish I could see her
The memories me and she could share
But Im too shy to wish her good morning
But then I dont mind shes always there
I started a song as I walked down maypole mews
She lives down there
She cant refuse to hearing my song
One thing I know that I can be sure of
Youre giving me your love youre just the same
One thing I know we dont know each other
I look at your window and stand in the rain so
I started a song as I walked down maypole mews
She lives down there
She cant refuse to hearing my song
I started a song as I walked down maypole mews
She lives down there
She cant refuse to hearing my song
La fadeWhoa whoa lucky me
Oh can this be all my dreams have come true
Lucky me got you
I didnt realize until I looked in your eyes
And when you held me close to you
Baby thats when I knew
Oh well I walk down the street and my happy heart sings
Ive got this world on a string
You wanna know the reason shes standing by my side
To love me and kiss me till the day I die
Whoa whoa lucky me
Oh how happy well be
All my dreams have come true

And this is all I know
And I must choose to live
For all that I can give
The spark that makes the power grow
But I will stand for my dream if I can
Symbol of my faith in who I am
But you are my only
And I must follow on the road that lies ahead
And I wont let my heart control my head
But you are my only
And we dont say goodbye

And I know what Ive got to be
Immortality

My fate is on the wind
The king of hearts the jokers wild
But we dont say goodbye
We dont say goodbye
Ill make them all remember me
Cause I have found a dream that must come true
Every ounce of me must see it through
But you are my only
Im sorry I dont have a role for love to play
Hand over my heart Ill find my way

When you say you need me and then leave
Evrything you tell me is a lie
You and I just dont see eye to eye
Soon youll run there is no fun remaining
The life I once enjoyed youve surely taken
Im convinced for years Ive been your clown
The heart I gave well you have just forsaken
You are the worst girl in this town
You are the worst girl in this town ah
There are lots like you that its not true
Id be a fool to stay and join the queue
Youve stayed with other men behind my back
I know that if I stay Ill surely crack
The life I once enjoyed youve surely taken
Im convinced for years Ive been your clown
The heart I gave well you have just forsaken
You are the worst girl in this town
You are the worst girl in this town ah
You are the worst girl in this townId like to be the one to see your loving mind at the start
But I get claustrophobia cause theres too many boys in your heart
Id like to know how far youd go to use those lips of wine
But I get claustrophobia cause theres too many boys on your mind
Oh one two three and now theres me
You practice to deceive
You lead me on another one
Ive got no room to breathe
So bye bye you who cant be true Im leaving you behind
Cause I get claustrophobia cause theres too many boys on your mind
I get claustrophobia cause theres too many boys on your mind
Oh one two three and now theres me
You practice to deceive
You lead me on another one
Ive got no room to breathe
So bye bye you who cant be true Im leaving you behind
Cause I get claustrophobia cause theres too many boys on your mind
Too many boys on your mind
Too many boys on your mindOne year two years time goes by
People laugh and people cry
Every morning the clock strikes eight
I go to work
I close the gate
And on my way I sing a song
About my wife where I belong
If the clouds get together and talk about the weather
If its rain they anticipate
Baby make no mistake
Yes the storm will break but never me you see
Two years on two years on
But only you can see me
Only you can see me
For what Ive got
Sir Lancelot was just a dream and I am not
For I am he with something more
Its you and I reality
If the cloud get together and talk about the weather
If its rain they anticipate
Baby make no mistake
Yes the storm will break but never me you see
Two years on two years on
But only you can see me
Only you can see meI cant stand the mornin light
Now youre gone there aint no one to make it right
The way you do
Evry day I fall more in love with you
Knowing that you let this heart of mine
Be captured at the start
And I know you know that I cant get through
Am I living a lie when I reach for you
You gotta save me save me
Only you can keep me warm above the storm
You gotta save me save me
You know there aint a world enough without your love
Gotta lay my head rest my heart
Dream my dreams but theyre all of you
And they fall apart the way I do
Evry night I fall more in love with you
Praying for the day youll turn around
And make your love all mine
When a man goes down for the very last time
You can throw him a line
You can keep him alive
Ooo baby save me save me
Only you can keep me warm above the storm
Why dont you save me save me
You know there aint a world enough without your love
When do I get to be near you for all time
When do I get to be near you
When a man goes down for the very last time
You can throw him a line
You can keep him alive ooo
Save me save me
Only you can keep me warm above the storm
Why dont you save me save me
You know there aint a world enough without your love love
You gotta
Save me save me
Only you can keep me warm above the storm
Why dont you save me save me
Only you can keep me warm
Ooo baby
Repeat last verse and fade outTheres a light
A certain kind of light
That never shone on me
I want my life to be lived with you
Lived with you
Theres a way everybody say
To do each and every little thing
But what does it bring
If I aint got you aint got
You dont know what its like baby
You dont know what its like
To love somebody
To love somebody
The way I love you
In my brain

I know my frame of mind
You aint got to be so blind
And Im blind so so so blind

Do you know me

If you hear me

Is it raining in the sunshine
And the wind blows in my eyes
Lying face down to the hard ground
I can face the cloudy skies
And although I maybe dying I will bide my love
Ill be waiting Ill be waiting
Ill be waiting in the storm
You were my girl in the springtime
With the sunshine in my day
Your sweet lips your fingertips
And you touch me but you wont stay
Is it raining in the sunshine
And the wind blows in my eyes
Lying face down to the hard ground
I can face the cloudy skies
And although I may be dying I will bide my love
Ill be waiting Ill be waiting
Ill be waiting in the storm
Can you hear me
Are you near me
In the stormWhere do I go when all the stars leave the sky
And all the magic that you do
That aint no way to say youre sorry
Wont fix my broken heart
Dont ever leave me girl
How can you leave me lovin you
Where do I go when all the words turn to lies
And steal the feeling that we knew
That aint no way to say youre sorry
Wont fix my broken heart
Please dont ever leave me girl
How can you leave me lovin you
Well I got a chance got a chance
Well no chance at all no chance at all
That I can make you understand
Oh let there be a chance be a day_
Oh let there be a place far away
The love that you and I alone can live with us
The story that our children hear
One day my love day my love
That you my love were born to be by life
Where do I go when all the stars leave the sky
And all the magic that you do
That aint no way to say youre sorry
Wont fix my broken heart
Dont ever leave me girl
How can you leave me lovin you
break
Wont fix my broken heart
Dont ever leave me girl
How can you leave me lovin you
Where do I go when all the stars leave the sky
And all the magic that you do
That aint no way to say youre sorry
Wont fix my broken heart
Dont ever leave me girl
How can you leave me lovin you

Im a comingI saw my problems and Ill see the light
We got a lovin thing we gotta feed it right
There aint no danger we can go too far
We start believin now that we can be who we are grease is the word
They think our love is just a growin pain
Why dont they understand Its just a cryin shame
Their lips are lyin only real is real
We stop the fight right now we got to be what we feel grease is the word
Grease is the word is the word that you heard
Its got a groove its got a meaning
Grease is the time is the place is the motion
Grease is the way we are feeling
We take the pressure and we throw away conventionality belongs to yesterday
There is a chance that we can make it so far
We start believin now that we can be who we are grease is the word
This is a life of illusion a life of control
Mixed with confusion - whatre we doin here
We take the pressure and we throw away conventionality belongs to yesterday
There is a chance that we can make it so far
We start believin now that we can be who we are grease is the word
Grease is the word is the word is the wordWhat am I wishing for
Something Ive had before
Ive seen your face in the firelight
Ive needed your love in the dark of the night
What am I wishing for
Someone like you someone like you
I know that someday my love its gonna be all right
Someday my love waiting for you tonight
Love grows I know its gonna be all right now
What am I wishing for

Someday my love waiting for you tonight
Love grows I know its gonna be all right now
What am I wishing for
Someone like you
Someone like you
Someone like you fadeI stumble in the night
Never really knew what it wouldve been like
Youre no longer there to break my fall
The heartache over you
Id give it everything but I couldnt live through
I never saw the signs
Youre the last to know when love is blind
All the tears and the turbulent years
When I would not wait for no-one
Didnt stop and take a look at myself
And see me losing you
When the lonely heart breaks
Its the one that forsakes
Its the dream that we stole
And Im missing you more
Than the fire that will roar
Theres a hole in my soul
For you its goodbye
For me its to cry
For whom the bell tolls
Seen you in a magazine
A picture at a party where you shouldnt have been
Hanging on the arm of someone else
Im still in love with you
Wont you come back to your little boy blue
Ive come to feel inside
This precious love was never mine
Now I know but a little too late
That I could not live without you
In the dark or the broad daylight
I promise Ill be there
When the lonely heart breaks
Its the one that forsakes
Its the dream that we stole
And Im missing you more
Than the fire that will roar
Theres a hole in my soul
For you its goodbye
For me its to cry
For whom the bell tolls
Now I know therell be times like this
When I couldnt reach out to no-one
Am I never gonna find someone
Who knows me like you do
Are you leaving me a helpless child
When it took so long to save me
Fight the devil and the deep blue sea
Ill follow you anywhere
I promise Ill be there
When the lonely heart breaks
Its the one that forsakes
Its the dream that we stole
And Im missing you more
Than the fire that will roar
Theres a hole in my soul
For you its goodbye
For me its to cry
For whom the bell tollsOoh every day you make me cry girl
I cry too much
And today you say goodbye girl
Its just too much
Hey I swallowed each and every lie
That you gave to me
Where lies the man that I was
And the future that could never be
Tomorrow every one gonna know me better
And tomorrow every one gonna drink my wine
And tomorrow every one gonna read my letter
And my story of love and a love that could never be mine
Ooh ask you to be my wife girl
You were playing
Now I ask you where is my life girl
You were saying
Hey I swallowed each and every lie
That you gave to me
Where lies the man that I was
And the future that could never be
Tomorrow every one gonna know me better
And tomorrow every one gonna drink my wine
And tomorrow every one gonna read my letter
And my story of love and a love that could never be mine
And tomorrow every one gonna know me better
And tomorrow every one gonna drink my wine
And tomorrow every one gonna read my letter
And my story of love and a love that could never be mineEvery single word has been spoken
Its much to late to change your ways
Far too many vows have been broken
You cant expect a soul to stay
You think that you can stand and lie
It makes me laugh
You got no friends
It took a thousand years to find out why
Youll never see my face again
You know that youve been left before this night
Its come my turn to make it over
I wish that every thing was colored white
I wish that I could be a rover
You think that you can stand and lie
It makes me laugh
You got no friends
It took a thousand years to find out why
Youll never see my face again
Every single word has been spoken
Its much to late to change your ways
Far too many vows have been broken
You cant expect a soul to stay
You think that you can stand and lie
It makes me laugh
You got no friends
It took a thousand years to find out why
Youll never see my face againI cried for you I cried for you
I cried for two I lied for you
Saved by the bell on your own carousel
Now who can tell if youll love that man as well
Now Ill walk down heartbreak lane
I died for you I died for two
Ill live for you Ill give to you
Saved by the bell on your own carousel
Now who can tell if youll love that man as wellIts not worth one night on earth
Baby I know baby I know
I wont know whose lips youre kissing
Baby I know
You dont know what you have done
Baby I know baby dont go
You dont know what you are missing
Baby and so
Theres not a sacrifice too strong
Ive been alone for far too long
Id be a fool to fail I follow you
You must believe
Promise the earth
Give her the ocean
A kiss on the wind goes straight to the heart
Promise the earth
With tears of emotion
If fate is a force that tears you apart
Please believe me I would sell my soul for you
Its not too late
And we can turn back the time
Baby I know
I lay down with you in dreams
Baby I know baby dont go
I was driven by this vision
Baby and so
If I could testify to you
Then I could prove my aim is true
If I am guilty or Im innocent
You must believe
Promise the earth
Give her the ocean
A kiss on the wind goes straight to the heart baby believe
Promise the earth
With tears of emotion
If fate is a force that tears you apart
You know Im only human so what am I supposed to say
Course Im gonna miss you and curse the day you went away
What I would surrender if I could make you turn around
The world weve got together forever is on solid ground
Oooh baby dont go
Baby dont go
Baby dont go
Baby
Youre part of every dream
Before the dawn
You must believe
Promise the earth
Give her the ocean
A kiss on the wind goes straight to the heart make her believe
Promise the earth
With tears of emotion
If fate is a force that tears you apart
Baby believe
Promise the earth
Give her the ocean
A kiss on the wind goes straight to the heart
Promise the earth
With tears of emotion
If fate is a force that tears you apart
Baby believe
Promise the earth

You better believeHe steals hearts and he steals my kisses
He stole away my love
He steals my thoughts
And now it seems
He stole into my dreams
Cos hes a thief oh
Hes a thief
Hes a thief
Hes got me ensnared in his clutches
His love does not seem real
Hes got me there in solitaire
His love is made of steel
But hes a thief oh yeah
Hes a thief oh
Hes a thief
I locked my heart and threw away the key
But hes knocked once and open sesame
He steals hearts and he steals my kisses
He stole away my love
He steals my thoughts
And now it seems
He stole into my dreams
But hes a thief
Oh hes a thief
Hes a thief fadeoutI was lost in your love
I was held by your heart
And no secrets stood between us anymore
Im like a child learning pain
I was held by your chains
And my darling I was lost in your love
Theres been a diffrence of opinion to the way Ive been treating you
But you know that Ive tried to apologize
for all the bad times Ive put you through
On the chance that I could make you mine
Theres not a thing I would not do
And wrong or right Ill be with you and lost in your love
I was lost in your love
I was held by your heart
And no secrets stood between us anymore
Im like a child learning pain
I was held by your chains
And my darling I was lost in your love
Now I will follow you where the wild bird flies
Through endless skies I will go
So I can be so near you girl and all of this you gotta know
That when I get you here inside my arms
I never ever ever will let you go
And wrong or right Ill be with you and lost in your loveNow I like the way you move
Anyway that you make it work
And you offer something new
And the doorway is open for me
Now a man needs a woman
And I know that for me is true
And life we got too much reality
Theres gotta be other things to do
Me electrify you
Simply mystify you
Very strange but nice
Now somebody wrong
And somebody right
And somebody knows its neither one thing or the other
Its a fine line between taking and giving
Its a fine line
Its fine line between dancing and making love
Its a fine line
I can see the possibility
Anyway that you wanna be
We all got secret emotions
Anytime after the midnight hour
Now love dont get short on the action
Anyway you got the energy
My heart is a part of the plans you made
Youre the star of my sexual fantasy
Me electrify you
Simply mystify you
Hope you stay all night
Ill have you for dinner or breakfast in bed
Either way I get you
For the worse or for the better
Its a fine line between taking and giving
Its a fine line
Its a fine line between dancing and making love
Its a fine line
Its wild its weird its what we think about
This aint no strip club shame on you cos
You know somebody that got a bead on what you need
Dont sacrifice your love
You analyze dont minimize
What only you can rise above
Now I know that dont you think
I know your watching me
You got no claim to make
Well thats no excuse
And know the truth
You got brain drain long as theres a game to play
Sad but theres only one fool to blame
Its a fine line between taking and giving
Its a fine line
Its a fine line between dancing and making love
Its a fine line
You dont think my love should tie you down
I say love can turn your groove around
Watch me please you
Watch me play your game
Someday love will make your water flow
Its a fine line fine line keep repeating Ah I had a lot of love last night
Ah
Ah I had a lot of love last night
Ah
Ah
Ive given all my love away and Ive been left with none
But can you say that Im to blame for loving anyone
I used to think that I was always older then my time
Were all breaking promises who will cry this time
Were all breaking promises who will cry this time
Ah I had a lot of love last night
had a lot a lot of love
Ah
Ah I had a lot of love last night
had a lot a lot of love
Ah
Im casting all my dreams hereto my fish have gone to sea
And fate no longer has the faith to walk ahead of me
I always used to think that I was better then my kind
Were all breaking promises who will cry this time
Were all breaking promises who will cry this timeWhy aint we livinlivin together instead of being so so far apart
Why aint we livinlivin together instead of being so so far apart

Everybody can hear you say thats out of style
My brother is friendly for reasons if I am the same
Just for four hundred seasons we all live in rain
So I laugh in your face
Your only one race
Yes I laugh in your face and Im right
You lie just like the rest
But theres nobody best
So I laugh in your face and Im right
Ill pull out your plug so your small
Youll slide down the drain
On the steps of St Peters you all look the same
So I laugh in your face
Your only one race
Yes I laugh in your face and Im right
You lie just like the rest
But theres nobody best
So I laugh in your face and Im rightPlease believe me I will never be untrue
And dont believe the jealous lies they told to you
Oh no dont go dont make this poor boy cry
Ill be true I beg of you dont say goodbye
Now dont you know I love you more than I can say
And it would mean my life if you should run away
Oh no dont go dont make this poor boy cry
Ill be true I beg of you dont say goodbye
You just wont listen to my pleas
You want me beggin on my knees
So sit right down and listen while I beg you see
Ill never be untrue so please believe in me
Oh no dont go dont make this poor boy cry

Ill be true I beg of you dont say goodbyeChorus
Eve never pleases me and Kitty can
Eve never pleases me and Kitty can
When Kitty smiles the world stands still
I see a thousand golden daffodils
But when she cries the world just dies
I see a million tears in Kittys eyes
Chorus
Now Eve is bad and treats me cruel
She loves to see me looking like a fool
I find a way with words I say
To be in love in such a lonely way
Chorus
Now they are two and I am one
I cannot fall in love with everyone
So I must choose between the two
Made up my mind now I am choosing you
ChorusLiving in another world living in another world
I had a special dream tonight I heard an angel call
I kissed a girl from India I saw the China wall
If men are men and mice are blind theyll never see the sun
And if the sun should go away Ill find another one
Oh what am I
Theres no simple answer
Oh what am I now
Love is just a mystery
Oh what am I
No one lives forever
Oh what am I now
Youll go down in history
Livin in another world whoa
Livin in another world whoa whoa
Im gonna change your life tonight a secret destiny
Im slipping in the twilight zone where everything is free
We got the planes the factories the strength of Hercules

Oh what am I

Oh what am I now
Please conserve your energy
Oh what am I

Youll go mad eventually

No mater how long

Well never be alone
Dont wanna make a wrong headline
No matter how strong
Theyll be watching every move you make
Dont let em know they can beat you
Fortune favor the brave
Learn how to use that muscle
Take a little chance will get you
Everything you see
Living at the speed of light
Gotta make your heart beat faster
You gotta climb inside
Set that spirit free
Fight the good fight
Fingers to the bone
Gotta take a stand
And save this land of liberty
Stumble on the ground that shakes you
Push it to the point that breaks you
Little bit of fire it gives you
Soul of a winner
Help you bring them to their knees
In the face of the foe
Never let em drag you under
Dont you wanna leave behind ya
A legacy
Catch another streak of lightning
By the God of fire and thunder
Battle in the name of the nation
Making historyTake hold of that star I give to you
And tell me that you love me
Just as I love you
Take hold of that star and put it in your locket
And tell me that you love me
Just as I love you
Chorus
Id give you the moon or the sun
or the starlights with a love so true
And if it rains Ill give you a rainbow too
Take hold of that star and put it in your locket
And tell me that you love me
Just as I love you
ChorusIf you think that you can hurt me and make my cry
Tell me why tell me why tell me why
And if you think that you can hurt me with lies that cry
Tell me why tell me why tell me why
Now Ive got my reasons for feeling this way
Day after day and as nights go by
So if you think my heart is broken and I might die
Tell me why tell me why tell me why
All of the world is as lonely as me
Day after day and as nights go by
So if you think my heart is broken and I might die
Tell me why tell me why tell me why
Tell me why tell me why tell me whyHave you come to say its over
Is it something I have failed to do
There is only you to blame
Youre not the same one that I knew
Can there be no conversation
Any animation if you please
Do you know Im old enough to read between the lines
Oh baby dont be so misunderstood
Baby its just one word after all
Baby dont be so misunderstood
Baby its just one word after all
And we can fall and we can fall
We can fall
Theres gonna be a thunder in the air

Gonna be a shadow on the sun
Someones gonna get you in the end
I would still be lovin you

Chorus
Me and my little white mountain goat
And the seas all fields around
Me and my little white mountain goat
With his eyes all treacle brown
Repeat verses twelve and chorusGiving you an ultimatum
Try to figure out why you
Act the way you doavoiding me
And trying to keep your distance
Saw your image in a photograph
Couldnt cry so I had to laugh
And the jealousy that I felt inside
Gave way to pure frustration
And you dont fool me with your sexy innuendos
And all the secrets you hide
You find adventure when your sleeping
In a brave new world
But you dont see me anymore
No you dont
I stand alone
No you dont
Your head is full of illusions
Your heart is stone
But you dont say us anymore
No you dont
And the light is gone
No you dont
No you dont say us anymore anymore
You dont say us you dont say us
Like the devil in the deep blue sea
Gotta have you and must be free
And all you do is torture me
And question what I stand for
Im a victim of circumstance
Just like in modern romance
And in my situation we go
Straight to a hotel room
And we take our chances and when I met you
You were standin in the moonlight
And your defences were down
I took advantage of a golden opportunity
But you dont see me anymore
No you dont
I stand alone
No you dont
Your head is full of illusions
Your heart is stone
You dont say us you dont say us
Soon when the night is young
Ill be old and gone
All because Im down
You dont say us you dont say us
And you dont fool me with your sexy innuendos
And all the secrets you hide
You find adventure when your
Sleeping in a brave new world
But you dont see me anymore
No you dont
I stand alone
No you dont
Your head is full of illusions
Your heart is stone
You dont say us you dont say us
Come hold me like before
Do the things you need to do
What I asked before
You dont say us you dont say us
But you dont see me anymore
No you dont
I stand alone
No you dont
Your head is full of illusions
Your heart is stone
You dont say us you dont say us
Come hold me like before
Do the things you used to do
What I asked beforeLooks like its over
You knew I couldnt stay
Shes coming home today
Weve had a good thing
Ill miss your sweet love
Why must you look at me that way
Its over
Ohh sad eyes
Turn the other way
I dont want to see you cry
Sad eyes
You knew thered come a day
When we would have to say goodbye
Try to remember
The magic that we shared
In time your broken heart will mend
I never used you
You knew I really cared
I hate to say it at the end
But its over
Ohh sad eyes
Turn the other way
I dont want to see you cry
Sad eyes
You knew thered come a day
When we would have to say goodbye
Sad eyes
You knew thered come a day
When we would have to say goodbye

Hey hey
When we would have to say goodbyeLife is just a bore
Its a drag to leave my door
Guess Ill have to say
I just cry my life away
Ill buy a top hat to brighten up my lonely life
And they can see that Ive got the money for the things money brings
Put it on my head and each time I head to bed
Put it in a box near my dirty shoes an socks

And until she comes and she brings me happiness
This is what I want nothing more nothing lessRain comes down on a misty day
Light on the water and shes coming my way
To be fair shes only wearing a smile
Ease all my trouble just by driving me wild
And like the moon dont function without the night
We come together and shes hanging on tight
She makes me tremble like I never before
Bringing me up to keep me begging for more
In every hour to be - let me satisfy your heart
I can take the days in return for the midsummer nights
We know the journey to a better life - better life
And we never to be letting go
You got to learn to be lonely to find what youre living for
Making love on a midsummer night
I love those midsummer nights
You seen the bad times without a doubt
I know you need me - but you couldnt get out
You build your heaven - itll never be home
In a place without love - how could you ever have known
There may be one fool falling in love with you
You are the vision that Im hanging on to
Any world - any dream you can see
Can be yours and mine if we want it to be
Let me lie in your arms
Let me understand your love
I can take the lonely days in return for the midsummer nights
We know the journey to a better life - better life
And we never to be letting go
You got to learn to be lonely to find what youre living for
Making love on a midsummer night
I love those midsummer nights
Making love to me only
Running forever - I following you
And Im not afraid
For every hour to be
Let me satisfy your heart
In return for those midsummer nights

Its just a photograph of someone that I knew
Have you seen my wife Mr Jones

Dont go talking too loud youll cause a landslide Mr Jones
I keep straining my ears to hear a sound
Maybe someone is digging underground
Or have they given up and all gone home to bed

Dont go talking too loud youll cause a landslide Mr Jones
In the event of something happening to me

Takes all she wants
Empty future for you
And you wont get the best of
What you dream of

And I am all alone
Ive sent the children far away
To some obscure unknown
Its so sad

Close another door
Listen to my eyes
Close another door
Youre much too old to work
So wont you run away
When I was young I used to say
That age wont bother me
The life I had was very sad
It all went out to sea
Chorus
And though the sun is in outside
The rain is in my hair
Now my life is lived inside
Now all my life is mystified
My home is in my chair
Chorus
Let me go
Send me flowers and
Put me on a plane
Ive paid before
So Ive been told
At least Im alive
I may be old but Ive been told at least Im still alive
Fly me young fly and tomorrow yeah
Get me up
I been working so so very hardNow she didnt get off to a very good start
And she tangled with love
And he broke her heart
In a crumbling home had shown the childhood dreams were never real
I can along she was seventeen
With the sun in her eyes and you know what I mean
She grew up too soon in the shade of my love
She taught me how to feel
Loving each other was never enough
She was watching me grow and she wrote it up
In a book of life she gave to me the day the white ship sailed
Farewell my darling au revoir
I will pray every day for you
And she would stay alone while Im away
She wouldnt walk all alone in the city without me
She would stay alone
She wouldnt play in the dark
With this love inside my heart
I came home on a summer night
And the wind in her hair and she looked just right
There was never another kind of women could see right through my soul
Suddenly after the southern rain
She rode out of my life on the midnight train
And I fell to the ground
And the world became the last place I should be
Wandering I will wait for you
For the sound of your voice
The dreams that you make
The book of life you gave to me still keeps my flame alive
Nobody knows which way Im going
But I only search for you
So wont you stay alone
While Im away
If we both walk in the same direction maybe my eyes will see you one day
Stay alone
And may your dreams come to be
All your love inside of me
Stay aloneOh youre a holiday such a holiday
Oh youre a holiday such a holiday
Its something I thinks worthwhile
If the puppet makes you smile
If not then youre throwing stones
Throwing stones throwing stones
Ooh its a funny game
Dont believe that its all the same
Cant think what Ive just said
Put the soft pillow on my head
Millions of eyes can see
Yet why am I so blind
When the someone else is me
Its unkind its unkind
Yet millions of eyes can see
Yet why am I so blind
When the someone else is me
Its unkind its unkind
Ooh youre a holiday every day such a holiday
Now its my turn to say and I say youre a holiday
Its something I thinks worthwhile
If the puppet makes you smile
If not then youre throwing stones
Throwing stones throwing stonesLiving in a world that dies within
you are they who try and touch the wind
You could be the blessed one
that makes me love you
And doing what youve never done before
taking every wave that hits the shore
you could be a silver star that shines
on my blue island
Its gonna be a blue island
See you on a blue island
Take you to a blue island
Blue island
You can see the rain
You can feel the pain
that no part of me is going through
Everybody say
we can find a way
Do you know the place youre going to
Youre going to a blue island
This is what the lonely heart must know
This is what it takes to make it grow
You could be a child alone
But you may save the world
Maybe its the words that mean goodbye
There but for the grace of God go I
I can see an open door that leads to my blue island
Gonna be a blue island
See you on a blue island
Take you to a blue island
Blue island
Blue island
Blue islandAh
Well I been working up a fever trying to
Straighten up the mess in my mind about this place
I cant contain myself anymore
Cant you see its written all over my face
Why dont you get on your feet
Its about time you got to think
What ever happened to peace
Well open your eyes and youll see children laughing
Voices singin hearts a-beatin ah
Your always talkin right and talkin about
The world and its corruption and moral decay
But what you gonna do about it nothing
Cause youre more like children then children while they play
Why youre so clean through and through you wont shake hands
With a negro whos maybe cleaner then you
Well listen around and youll hear children laughin
Voices singin hearts a-beatin like they always do
So whats wrong with you ah
Youre so blown up with anger about the world
You write the songs about
Yet you dont even know your neighbors name
Now you want to go the the moon and live there
When you know itll only end up the same
How can he give you any gratitude
With your endless sickenin attitude
You strive to get ahead
But you leave each other dead
Cant you see children laughin
Voices singin hearts beatin like they always do
So whats wrong with you ah
Children laughin voices singin hearts beatin
Children laughin voices singin fadeAll that I need is just a piece of paper
Say a few lines make up my mind
so she can read it later when Im gone
Elisa goodbye Elisa
All that I need is just a quiet corner
Bring to the light things I must write

Live and live a lasting life
Town of tuxleys wheres I want to be

And money speaks louder than toys

Make them wide and make them tall
Break

Thats what the children they cry
Make me a soldier or castle so high
And to this we will buyNow if the aim in your life is to settle me down
I couldnt change my point of view
I got a lady in red at the back of my head
But the women in white is you
Do you wanna be the only one
Fade away in the morning sun
I could love you all of my life
You are my wife
Havent I let you know
We dont need no buried treasure
No buried treasure - we dont need it
We dont stand on ceremony
I love you only - Im proud of it
You can never be all you wanna be
When youre living for gold
We dont need no buried treasure
I still got you
I still go you in my soul
Well its a long way down and you gotta get up
You got to figure on a master plan
You couldnt do it if you dont get ready
When youre beaten by the other man
Do you wanna be the last one in
Play the game that you just dont win
I can see me making you cry
Saying goodbye
But I could never let you go
We dont need no buried treasure
No buried treasure - we dont need it
We dont stand on ceremony
I love you only - Im proud of it
You can never be all you wanna be
When youre living for gold
We dont need no buried treasure
I still got you
I still got you in my soul
Well youre taking my life in the palm of your hand
Make you mine for another day
Aint nobody doesnt need anybody
When the good times turn away
I dont wanna be the lonely one
Fade away in the evening sun
I could love you all of my life
You are my wife
Havent I told you so
We dont need no buried treasure
No buried treasure - we dont need it
We dont stand on ceremony
I love you only - Im proud of it
You can never be all you wanna be
When youre living for gold
We dont need no buried treasure
I still got you
I still got you in my soulPardon me if I use you in my dreams
You throw those angel eyes at me
Or could the beautiful woman be more than she seems
But she is not in love with me
All of my life I been looking for someone to carry my love away
A chip on my shoulder a misery suddenly there you are
Nobody knows but she knows that I love her
Its got to be growing
I cant wait no longer
Life goes on for the lonely man
When love goes wrong only love knows why
Life goes on for the lonely man
Well be the dreams well be the seasons
You and I I
Suddenly all the world gets in the way
You disappear into the crowd
Maybe the beautiful woman never really came
But I still call your name out loud
I want to know you but I never met you
Reality can be cruel
If a wandering soul meets another
They shouldnt be separated
Better in love with your head on my shoulder
But Ill never be satisfied
And if I cant see you
Life goes on for the lonely man
When love goes wrong only love knows why
Life goes on for the lonely man
Well be the dreams well be the seasons
You and I I
Living your life in someone elses heart
A lovers dream that has no end
There may be somebody you can base your world upon
Ill never be the same again
And theres a part of me here
And theres a part of me with you
But all of me loves you
Nobody gave me the feeling you gave me
Im so proud of
All of my days I will be here for you
And the love keeps running
And if I cant hold you
Life goes on for the lonely man
And theres a million words for the one goodbye
Life goes on for the lonely man
Well be the dreams well be the seasons
You and I I
Life goes on for the lonely man
And theres a million words for the one goodbye
Life goes on for the lonely man
Well be the dreams well be the seasons
You and I ILoose talk costs lives
People like to play
Were basically the same
We never lie
Loose talk costs lives
Dont look at me as if you dont remember me at all
There was laughter there was pain
But I wont make the same mistakes I made
You are too beautiful to me
I hide my tears inside the rain
Am I the soul you cast your spell upon
I had control and now its gone
Or are you someone who controls my heart and mind
And I will never say a word
And I will never say goodbye
Loose talk costs lives
People like to play
Were basically the same
We never lie
Loose talk costs lives
I can see that someone hung a sign around your heart
And it reads do not return
And there is so much trouble I could cause
Someone as beautiful as you
You can feel my candle burn
And I still recall some starry night
We had it all we held on tight
I promised I would come to you and catch you if you fall
And they will never know about us
For just one moment you were mine
Loose talk costs lives
People like to play
Were basically the same
We never lie
Loose talk costs lives
For just one moment just one moment you were mine
Loose talk costs lives
Our moment held in time
People like to play
Were basically the same
We never lie
Loose talk costs lives
Loose talk costs lives
People like to play
Were basically the same
We never lie
Loose talk costs livesWhere are you where are you
Night is day and day is night
Where are you where are you
Need you girl youre not in sight
Our love would grow but you leave and I know
That you dont love me where are you
I need you girl youre not in sight
I told you I told you
I was never coming back ah
You told me you told me
You would give my love the sack ah
Now as I fly you wont tell me goodbye
Cause you dont love me where are you
Now you give my love the sack ah
Now as my heart lies in pieces of eight
You were a part of my love but too late
I love you I love you
This I think that you should know
Ill be blue Ill be blue
You are still cause I must
Id like to stay but I know you wont play
And see things my way where are you
You are still cause I must go
You are still cause I must
I must go where are you Alons viens encore cherie
Jattendrai patiemment sous la lampe dans la vieille avenue
Then I may end
She had things to buy
I close my eyes
Yet I dont know why
I gave her money said she knew someone
And she said she wont be long
Lamplight keep on burning while this heart of mine is yearning
Lamplight keep on burning till this love of yours is mine
I sat alone with my thoughts and laughed
Then saw your face in an old photograph
I didnt think that I could live without you but what am I to do
Lamplight keep on burning while this heart of mine is yearning
Lamplight keep on burning till this love of yours is mine
Come home again dear
I have waited year after year
Under the lamp in our old avenue
If all in the world thats laughing why should it make us cryCowman milk your cow
Keep away from the dark skies
Who knows what the weather may bring
Could be snow when the white dove sings
That could be a million years
And thats a long long time
Tell me how many springs
Will it take before the end
And how many breathes will it take
Till the moment when we all decide
Maybe for a million years
And thats a long long time
Cowman milk your cow
Keep away from the dark skies
Who knows what the weather may bring
Could be snow when the white dove sings
That could be a million years
And thats a long long time
Tiger in your cage
Youre not different from the man I know
All my worlds a stage
Im just waiting for the evening show
That could be a million years
And thats a long long time
Cowman milk your cow
Keep away from the dark skies
Who knows what the weather may bring
Could be snow when the white dove sings
That could be a million years
And thats a long long time
That could be a million years
And thats a long long time
Long long long time
Long long long timeAnd the rain will fall it falls for you
And the clouds will break into tears
You should be here standing so near to me
Cept I know you should be sad
But give me time alone to get it out of my mind
Though say I know its only the weather
Cause every time it rains you are gone
And Im blue
Then I wake up then I wake up
And the sun will shine if just for you
And the trees will talk to the skies whispering lies
Heaven will pass to me yeah
Trains walk by and the birds disappear
Oh Why am I still here without you by my side
So I cry your name and love
The thought to me is back and how near
Then I wake up then I grow up
And the rain will fall
It falls for you
And the clouds will break
It should be near
And the sun will shine
If just for you
And the loveI dont know how but nights get lonely now
They keep appearing in my eyes
Such a warm and tender glow
For just one moment I remember all
The love we had was never all that bad
There were smiles and there were tears
On that special starry night with your arms around me
Held on tight
Wasnt that the way it was
Two strangers reaching for a worthless cause
Wasnt that the love we shared
Or just the restless years when no-one cared
I dont know why its hard to say goodbye
Or even justify the end
You meant so very much to me
Then to let you go start my life again
The love we had was never all that bad
There were smiles and there were tears
Till that special summer day
When I reached out for you you just walked away
Wasnt that the way it was
Two strangers reaching for a worthless cause
Wasnt that the love we shared
Or just the restless years when no-one caredThe woman in you brings out
The man in me
Its the woman in you
And the finer parts of your anatomy
But baby sharper than a knife
Help me to know you
Show me the night to satisfy
A sinner with the flash of an eye
Therell never be another me
I never knew love could wind me up
I dont do my stuff
Til you go walkin by
And maybe old enough to try
I never knew anyone in between
The devil and the angel
All in one and maybe old
Enough that I can ride
Your love let me burn
Let me slide down to your soul
You can pull me in
You can push me out
But your baby needs love
Somebody to hold
Show me what to do
The woman in you brings out
The man in me
Its the woman in you
And the finer parts of your anatomy
But baby stronger than the wind burn
In the fire out of the night
Ill teach you how to tremble
If you give me the night
Therell never be enough to me
I never knew I could find the best
But searchin out the rest there
Is no doubt and maybe we can
Sweat it out
I never knew we could find
A way this crazy situation
Over me and we forget about
The world outside
My love in your eyes
Theres no world
There is no time
You can hold me in
You can throw me down
But your baby needs love
Somebody to hold
Show me what to do
The woman in you brings out
The man in me
Its the woman in you
And the finer parts of your anatomyI walk the lonely streets
I watch the people passing by
I used to smile and say hello
Guess I was just a happy guy
Then you happened girl
This feeling that possesses me
I just cant move myself
I guess it all just had to be
Chorus
I cant see nobody no I cant see nobody
Mine eyes can only look at you you
I used to have a brain I used to think of many things
I watched the falling rain and listened to the sweet birds sing
Dont ask me why little girl
I love you and thats all I can say
Youre evry evry breath I take
You are my nights my night and day
Chorus
Every single word you hear
Is coming from this heart of mine
I never felt like this before
A love like yours so young and fine
And now as I try to forget you
It doesnt work out any way
I loved you such a long time ago
But in my eyes youll always be
Every single word you hear
Is coming from this heart of mine
I loved you such a long time ago
Dont know why
And I dont know why baby
Chorus Gone gone childhood days
Gone in so many ways
All that I have said and done
The castles we have overcome
At last you have found a friend
The sweetest voice will never end
And it echoes down the mountainside
People live and people die
Friendly face will always be
Wrapped up in my childhood days
Old dogs and worn out shoes
Even children sing the blues
How we must endure it all
To save Gods creatures great and small
All my world is there and then
The voices come to me again
And they echo down the mountainside
People live and people die
I still can see my Daddys face
Oh Lord this is a lonely place
Fast train train too slow
Maybe you got no place to go
Let me set your spirit free
Its crazy but you comfort me
We share together what we found
The force of love is all around
And it echoes down the mountainside
Little bit of soul we hide
Find us lost without a trace
Oh Lord this is a lonely place
Gone gone childhood days
Gone in so many ways
In all my children you can see
What old acquaintance means to me
Dream is mine and here it stays
All wrapped up in my childhood days
And it echoes down the mountainside
People live and people die
Tho I love you for always
I lost you in my childhood daysHey there woman I came to california
To find a dream I found you girl
Hey there baby you pointed my direction
With tender love changed my world
Ive been reachin for love so long

Ive been running down avenues
So filled with solitude and restless fears
Danger slow down hauntin me
Your love turnin me round rescued me
Danger warnin Ive seen the signs
Oh oh oh here I go this heart of mine
I set sail on a rainy day
Steerin my way through a cloudy sky
In this heaven my dreams are never ending
Theyre sending me through space and time
Youre the center of all my inspiration
Its a wonderland its so divine
I cant escape from this energy
You put a spell on me yeah no turnin round
Power of love has no gravity
Its got a hold on me Im paralyzed
Danger slow down hauntin me
Your love turnin me round rescued me
Distant dreams of yesterday
When I was down and far away
You promise me love but Im scared of losin
What I got what I got today
Danger slow down hauntin me
Your love turnin me round rescued me
Danger warnin Ive seen the signs
Oh oh oh here I go this heart of mine
Danger slow down fadeWhere is the sun
That shone on my head
The sun in my life
It is dead
It is dead
Where is the light
That would play
In my streets
And where are the friends
I could meet
I could meet
Where are the girls
I left far behind
The spicks and the specks
Of the girls on my mind
Where is the sun
That shone on my head
The sun in my life
It is dead
It is dead
Where are the girls
I left far behind
The spicks and the specks
Of the girls on my mind
Where are the girls

Of the girls on my mind
Where is the girl I loved

The girl that I loved
Shes gone

Of my life ve gone away
All of my life

The spicks and the specks
Of my life ve gone away
Everybody
Spicks and Specks
Spicks and SpecksI grabbed my hat and I went walking in the rainy night
My world turned upside down
I heard the roaring of the engines of a DCthree
Im Casablanca bound
The stewardess was standing staring in a fashion
That could only take my breath away
The pilots voice came on the intercom
And told me he was workin for the CIA
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
And hes lost in a dangerous world
So keep on runnin runnin in the black of night
Secret agent
Just keep on runnin runnin at the speed of light
Secret agent
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
And three days later I was woken by a lady in black
She took my photograph
And in the safety of the shadows
Threw her cameras down the elevator shaft
She ran and stumbled in the darkness of the empty streets
My job had just begun
And without warning I was shaken by a blinding light
Didnt see the gun ooh
And hes lost in a dangerous world
So keep on runnin runnin in the black of night
Secret agent
Just keep on runninrunnin like the speed of light
Secret agent
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Secret agent
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Secret agent agent
Look out
So keep on runnin runnin till you get away
Youre a secret agent
So keep on runnin runnin in the black of night
Youre a secret agent
So keep on runnin runnin in the black of night
Youre a secret agent
Just keep on runnin runnin like the speed of light
Cause youre a secret agent
Just keep on runnin runnin till the break of day
Cause youre a secret agent
Just keep on runnin runnin till you get away
Cause youre a secret agentDidnt I like to hold you in my hand
I was doing you no harm
I made you understand
All my life Ive been that way
It happened long ago
Didnt I pray to love you through the night
I was dreaming wide awake
The early morning light shine on me
A sorry state
My heart has told me so
And the storm clouds gather overhead
No shelter we can share
Lie down in my flower bed
I got no control
I would sell my soul
To be there
So forever do or die
We just belong
Kiss hello no wave goodbye
And the heat is stronger
For the moment when we touch
No wind can hold me
Come from loving you too much
And the nights are longer
Make it like a memory
Make it like a dream unreal
Make it like we never met
But I cant forget
Its how I feel
Make it like a memory
Take away the sound and the sight
Therell never be another love
With the power of you and i
Maybe Im wrong to hold you in my hand
I believed you when you lied
I tried to understand
All my life Ive been that way
It happened long ago
Make it like a memory
Make it like a dream unreal
Make it like we never ever met
But I cant forget
Its how I feel
Make it like a memory
Take away the sound and the sight
Therell never be another love
With the power of you and iYou better run just as fast as you can Ive got no reason to try
You did it to me and Im takin a stand Youve got a reason to cry
Fairy stories in the penny arcade
You bought my love and I paid
Im not trying to make history
You could have been good to me music
Fairy stories in the penny arcade
You bought my love and I paid
Im not trying to make history
You could have been good to me
Spent my life a-makin my love to you
Ive got no reason to try
Got no reason left for makin you blue
Youve got a reason to cry
Fairy stories in the penny arcade
You bought my love and I paid
Im not trying to make history
You could have been good to meSitting here all alone
Wondering what to do
Life went faster than the time
I had to achieve the things I had in mind
Their disguise I see with my eyes
Many things I should have realized
A long time ago long long time ago
Never changing ever aging
It drags from day to day
I wish that I had found myself
Before it robbed me of the time
Oh no oh no
I should have realized
A long long time ago
A long time ago
A long time ago
break
Seeing things open doors
People invited me into
Oh they were so good to me
And always helped me on my way
Then I woke from this dream
Known that I should have realized
A long time ago
Long long time ago
Another day another way
I dont care what people say
No I realize that theres no other way for me
Suppose Ill just have to live from day to day
Oh no oh no
I should have realized
A long long time ago
A long time ago
A long time agoIn your eyes I see only one
Find me the place for us thats where I belong
There we rise your glory and mine
Your pain is over now I make you shine
Still believing
All the love in the world wont take me away from you
My love is stronger I am what you make me
All the love in the world wont take you away from me
In all my wonder I forever lay down here with you
I find when love slips away
Reach out for all you can before its too late
There you fly returnin to me
Out of your darkest nights I stand alone
Still believing
All the love in the world wont take me away from you
My love is stronger I forever lay down here with you
My love is true all your darkest nights
I stand alone still believing
All the love in the world wont take me away from you
My love is stronger I forever lay down here with you
All the love in the world wont take you away from me
My love is stronger I forever lay down here with you
All the love in the world wont take me away from youIncidentally there should some changes made
Youve got to work if you should have to save
An apple is a fool but lemons never do forget
Youve got to play it cool before they come and throw the net
Wait a while and straighten out the tie you wear
Youve got to take it easy if you dare
An apple is a fool but lemons never do forget
Youve got to play it cool before they come and throw the net
Dont be blind youve got a thinking mind
Stop the bells that ring so loud
Dont nod your head youll draw a crowd
Just think of everything youve worked so hard to bring
The lemon sings my song
Hes known it all along
Incidentally there should be some changes made
Youve got to work if you should have to save
An apple is a fool but lemons never do forget
Youve got to play it cool before they come and throw the net
Dont be blind youve got a thinking mind
Stop the bells that ring so loud
Dont nod your head youll draw a crowd
Just think of everything youve worked so hard to bring
The lemon sings my song
Hes known it all along
Incidentally there should be some changes made
Youve got to work if you should have to save
An apple is a fool but lemons never do forget
Youve got to play it cool before they come and throw the netWatching every day go by living in a foolish game
Just the way I feel today
Living my life without you
Never hear a single word living in a lullaby
Praying every tear I cry
Living my life without you
And everywhere you go I fly I love you with a special feeling
And darling till the day I die baby never stop believing
Ill be reaching out Ill be reaching out
Reaching out theres a woman goin through me
Ill be reaching out got a chance to hold you to me
Everything is lonely and I need you
Living my life forever forever
Watching every day go by
Living on the one I love
What I got is not enough
Living my life without you
And I believe in yesterday yesterday was once tomorrow
With love with love wide open every waybaby youre the light I follow
Ill be reaching out Ill be reaching out
Reaching out theres a woman going through me
Ill be reaching out got a chance to hold you to me
Everything is lonely and I need you
Living my life forever

Living my life forever
Reaching out Ill be reaching out Repeat So many lovers too many nights
Face in the mirror that keeps you alive
So close together so far apart
Im so afraid without you
Rain on the river Ill never cross
Wind on the ocean the feeling is lost
I still believe that you cry for me
Will I survive without you
Like a fool I was waiting
Like a fool for you to come back
Fool I was standing alone in the rain
Like a fool I was dreaming
Like a fool to lose you this way
And now Im just fooling myself
Hearts go a-beating love out of time
Streets without pity I search for a sign
Oh I keep running into the night
But Im still lost without you
Too many lovers too many nights
Face in the window that keeps me alive
So close together so far apart
Will I survive without you
Like a fool I was waiting
Like a fool for you to come back
Like a fool I was standing alone in the rain
Like a fool I was dreaming
Like a fool to lose you this way
Like a fool I was standing alone in the night
I traveled so far
In the lonely lonely night
In the lonely and me
Like a fool I was waiting
Like a fool for you to come back
Like a fool I was standing alone in the rain
Like a fool I was dreaming
Like a fool to thing you would stay
Like a fool and now Im just fooling my selfHey there little girl welcome to my world

But its only love for you that I walk this lonely road
I must follow the wind follow the wind
And the wind will take me hold before the cold
Every stay I have counted
Each flower I have seen
But the place where Im going theres no grass as green
I must follow the wind follow the wind
And the wind will take me home where I can dream
In the hour I am lonely youre love will be mine
I will stay in your arms dear until comes the time
I must be on my way for my home is anywhere
I have no time to stay I have no time to care
I must follow the wind follow the wind
As the wind gently blows in my hair
I must follow the wind follow the wind
As the wind gently blows in my hair
I must follow the wind follow the wind
As the wind gently blows in my hairThere are times that I should go away
To think of you and I
For it isnt only now I need your love
All of my life all of my life
In the night time when I lie awake
And think of you in my heart
For it isnt only now I need your love
All of my life all of my life
Oh wouldnt you believe me if I told you
That I love you and I do
Everyone believes me when I tell them
Why dont you why dont you
When I think of things that ought to be
And I feel your hand in mine
Yes it isnt only now I need your love
All of my life all of my life
All of my life all of my life
Oh wouldnt you believe if I told you
That I love you and I do
Everyone believes me when I tell them

Cos youre a bad girl
And all you ever do is break my heart in two

This love of mine
A waste of time

Youre gonna be a sad girl
I aim to throw your love away
Cos youre gonna cheat me
I know its true and Im warning you
Stay away from me stay away from me

Stay away from me stay away from me
Stay away from me stay away from me
Stay away from me stay away from meIn the summer of his years he would always smile
He would laugh every day if he was here to stay
For the summer of his years
In the daylight of his dreams he would save his tears
He would always hear when there was no one near
For the summer of his years
For the summer of his years
For the summer of his yearsIve discovered for myself this time
The start of everything to me
Is to know our love is older than the sea
But dont let another flame inside
Your fire-proof heart
cause Im not your full-time lover
And its tearing me apart
Ive been hangin on this line too long
eight hundred and fifty-five-seven thousand and nineteen
Dont you ever answer
eight hundred and fifty-five-seven thousand and nineteen
Dont you hear the word
Search for a sign baby
She was the past and the future
I just got burned
eight hundred and fifty-five-seven thousand and nineteen
Is a private number
I know in your mind that you think
Its a crime but I had to call
First and last there will
Never be a past or a future
If you kill my phone
Baby lifts her eyes
And Im a slave to all the lies
And Im forever lost
I believe in you and me
Together and it keeps this love alive
eight hundred and fifty-five-seven thousand and nineteen
Dont you ever answer
eight hundred and fifty-five-seven thousand and nineteen
Dont you hear the word
Search for the sign baby
She was the past and the future
I just got burned
I have suffered for my sins today
With the pain of love
Before the dawning comes
The darker is the night
Im born to be the one to share your life
That shows I dont need no operator
I dont want no one to know
How much I need you
eight hundred and fifty-five-seven thousand and nineteen
Dont you ever answer
I know in your mind that you think
Its a crime but I had to call
First and the last there will
Never be a past or a future
If you kill my phone
Baby lifts her eyes and Im a slave to all the lies
And Im forever lost
I believe in you and me together
And it keeps this love aliveWhen I was small and Christmas trees were tall
We used to love while others used to play
Dont ask me why but time has passed us by
Some one else moved in from far away
Now we are tall and Christmas trees are small
And you dont ask the time of day
But you and I our love will never die
But guess well cry come first of May
The apple tree that grew for you and me
I watched the apples falling one by one
And I recall the moment of them all
The day I kissed your cheek and you were mine
Now we are tall and Christmas trees are small
And you dont ask the time of day
But you and I our love will never die
But guess well cry come first of MaySunday morning woke up yawning filled the pool for a swim
Pulled down the head and looked in the glass just to see if I was in
Went up the stairs and kissed my woman to make her come alive
cause with fifteen kids and a family on the skids
I got to go for a Sunday drive
Fifteen kids and a family on the skids
I got to go for a Sunday drive
Thats how they are so I grabbed out the car convertible fifty-nine
Headed to the freeway tried to find the Pasadena sign
Ten miles and three quarters I wasnt feeling any more alive
cause with fifteen kids and a family on the skids
I got to go for a Sunday drive
Fifteen kids and a family on the skids
I got to go for a Sunday drive
I used to be a minstrel free with a whole lot of bread in my bag
I used to feel that my life was real but the good Lord threw me a snag
Now Im gonna be the same as me no matter how I try
Cause with fifteen kids and a family on the skids
I got to go for a Sunday drive
Fifteen kids and a family on the skids
I got to go for a Sunday drive
Turned round the car and headed for home I guess I realized my fate
Ten miles and three quarters more I pulled up outside the gate
Twenty more kids were stood inside and that made thirty-five
Cause with an orphanage full of thirty-five kids
I got to go for a Sunday drive
An orphanage full of thirty-five kids
I got to go for a Sunday drive
Sunday morning woke up yawning filled the pool for a swim
Pulled down the glass and looked in the mirror just to see if I was in
Went up the stairs and kissed my woman to make her come alive
cause with an orphanage full of thirty-five kids
I got to go for a Sunday drive
An orphanage full of thirty-five kids
I got to go for a Sunday drive

They laugh as they walk on through
And no one will know its you
Youre the girl who hurt me
Ill never see your lovely face

Ill hide it so oh
Theyll never know
And all the time until I scream and run
While I go on dreaming about you
For all this love that Ive been giving
Must I go on living without you

I walk with my head held high
And no one will know
Inside Im the boy who lost you
Ill never see those angel eyes
Youre just a devil in disguise
Ill hide it so oh

Oh theyll never know
Oh theyll never know
Oh theyll never know
Oh theyll never know
Oh theyll never knowone thousand, nine hundred and seventy-four
Some nights we made our love in the sand
And at the tide we held our love in our hands
And we listened to music the ocean was playing
The words that our two hearts were saying
That only two lovers can make
Let us ride on the wind while this moment is real
Your the light of my life
You are welcome to my Charade
And this felling knowing you blessed me forever
And believing I have been touch by your love
And the pleasure of knowing the evening wont tare us apart
We can follow the sun to the day light is gone
We can gaze up the sky till the night is over
Light of my life
You are welcome to my Charade
And this felling knowing you blessed me forever
We can follow the sun to the day light is gone
We can gaze at the sky till the night is over
Light of my life
You are welcome to my Charade
And this feeling knowing you blassed me forever
We can follow the sun to the day light is gone
We can gaze at the sky till the night is over
Light of my life
You are welcome to my CharadeJumbo said to say goodnight
See you in the morning
Please dont lose your appetite
He knows who is yawning
tomorrow you can climb a moutain
Sail a sailboat trough a fountain
Jumbo said he say goodnight
Play no games hed say to me
We know who is wrong
So please dont make no hesitation
There will be no recriation
Jumbo said to say goodnight
Hes a friend of yours
Listen you can chew it
If its loud enough you can hear it
Cause its narrow as a sparrow
And it shoots a bow and arrow
Throa top thats made with
Powder with a gun its even louderLook at me Im riding high
Dont know whats wrong with me
Cant you see Im not the guy
That I pretend to be
Though I know I will be lonely
But our love will never die
I close my eyes everyday I close my eyes
The more I try the more I fail
Id like to run away
But if I try you pass me by
I know that I cant stay
Though I know I will be lonely
But our love will never die
I close my eyes everyday I close my eyes
Though I know I will be lonely
But our love will never die
I close my eyes everyday I close my eyes
I close my eyes Repeat I could be king of kings wear a crown and all the things
Id want Id never need
Id be an ace in an aeroplane and every year Id fly to Spain
If I could get the nerve to plant the seed
Chorus
Oh tell me how to say goodbye
I see her face in myself
Why tell me why I made her cry
If only had my mind on something else
Captain of the submarine beneath the icebergs never seen
A hero with a medal for everyday
I find me famereach the top
I keep on pushing never stop
If I could just forget her name
ChorusOoh love was true yesterday
I love you evry way
I saw you standing there
You gave me cause to stare
And then I knew I had to have you
You could be mine if you tried
All that you do is tell me lies
You think that loves a game
But I dont feel the same
I should have known that Ill get the pain
Ooh love was true yesterday
I love you evry way
I saw you standing there
You gave me cause to stare
And then knew I had to have youMother Im going to join the Air Force today
I dont care what the neighbors may say
But Im going to join the Air Force today
MotherI dont care what my father might think
Perhaps its going to drive him to drink
But I dont care what my father might think
Dont ask me why its my mind and its right
Dont ask me why its my mind
Its better its better than being alone
Alone on the ground Now I find
MotherIve got to join the Air Force you see
Ive seen my friends and they all agree
Thats its better than joining the army or going to sea
MotherIve go to join the Air Force you see
Ive seen my friends and they all agree
Thats its better then joining the army or going to sea
Mother Mother MotherShe takes the heart of mine
She make it beat in time
In fact shes mine forever

We came to love in the neighborhood
And the love dont cease to grow
And if you need me darlin
Ill be dreamin on
Dreamin on for you baby
Dreamin on for you woman-child
Dreamin on for you baby
She makes the skies grow dark
She makes the darkness bright
She make the wind grow warm in
The wake of another cold and stormy night
And anywhere she needs me Ill be runnin to

And tho Id really like to be with you
She gave me love when there was no love
And I would not let her go
So if you need me darlin

AhfadeI never knew until tonight of the danger
That any man could lose his life to a stranger
Catch me when I am falling
Ive been burned by the fire before
And girl I tell you no lies
I dont wanna feel the pain anymore
But I need you tonight
All of my trouble my torture and tears
Its over for now gone with the wind
But I need you tonight
So afraid of the past that you made me tonight
Gone its gone with the wind
I know that once upon a time Id surrender
And lovin you was twice as nice but not forever
And I got too much emotion
And then love has just cut like a knife
And you know it tears me apart
Cause I dont wanna feel the pain anymore
But I need you tonight
All of my trouble my torture and tears
Its over for now gone with the wind
But I need you tonight
So afraid of the past that you made me tonight
Gone its gone
I tell you no lies
I dont wanna be alone anymore
But I need you tonight
All of my problems my torture and tears
Gone with the wind
You know I need you tonight
But I need you tonight
All of my sorrows are fading and gone with the wind
You know I need you tonight
All of my trouble my torture and tears
Its over for now gone with the wind
But I need you tonight
So afraid of the past that you made me tonight
Gone its gone with the windOoh ooh ooh
When you wait and you watch
And youre wishing for something wild
I figure I can please you someday someway
I figure I can put your love on trial
Im taking you back to school
Talk about making it something real
Nobody could deny you anything
Chorus
You know Id do anything
Anything for you
You know Id do anything
Anything for you
You know Id do anything
Anything for you
You know Id do anything
Anything for you
You you you
You can run with the fun
You can tickle my nerves inside
In the face of heartbreak heartache

Better we make it soon
Let it be the one that make you
Cry for more
Anyone else would buy you anything
Id do anything
Chorus
Id do anything

Chorus
Id do anything

I cant explain it what she was thinking of and when
Mother Nature she put us both together
And the way she touched me and I ran that red light
And so I said I love her she tell me I dont matter
I try to kiss her but every dream is shattered
No early warning except the morning after
Look in the mirror like a rabbit in the headlights
She keeps on coming back for more
She keeps on coming back for more
She keeps on coming back for more
Champagne and roses breakfast in bed
Wrapped in each other and out of my head
She keeps on coming back for more
She keeps on coming back for more
She aint no Cleopatra I aint no Julius Caesar
I aint no Casanova she aint no Mona Lisa
She charm a nation she send you out to die
And we were flying when she ran that red light
I aint no Valentino she aint no Greta Garbo
No Aphrodite Ill never be Apollo
But when we come together theres no one else can follow
Theres no tomorrow when we run that red light
She keeps on coming back for more
She keeps on coming back for more
She keeps on knocking at the door
Drunk on desire erotic delights
Sooner or later shell kiss you good night
She keeps on coming back for more
She keeps on coming back for more
Midnight die in the arms of a lover dream time shes mine always here
Hold tight I close my eyes and shes gone small town daytime disappear
She keeps on coming back for more
She keeps on coming back for more
She keeps on coming back for more
Drunk on desire erotic delights
Sooner or later shell kiss you good night
But she keeps on coming back for more
She keeps on coming back for more
She keeps on knocking at the door
She keeps on coming back for more
She keeps on coming back for more
She keeps on coming back for moreYoure not meant to be alone
Ill share your dream
Ill show you love youve never known
Two flames together in the deep of the night
Im up in your love
Close by you when you call
Ill take my stand
One chance to make or lost it all
This time my journey to wherever you are
I sail on your river so far my love well never be found
If you believe
We got eyes that see in the dark
And the power of love lives for making you mine
And in the light of close investigation
Is it only my imagination
I got you
Moonlight shining on your face
My bridges burned
With all my tears that you replaced
Two hearts together is a beautiful sight
Ill take you to heaven so far my love will follow you there
If we believe
We got eyes that see in the dark
And the power of love lives for making you mine
Am I the light of someone you need more of
Let me be that love you can be sure of
Is it only my imagination
I got you
Like the eagle that flies in the sun
Ill be lost in your fire before we are done
And the view from my window is brighter
Born to be all you need
We got eyes that see in the dark
And the power of love lives for making you mine
Am I the light of someone you need more of
Let me be that love you can be sure of
Is it only my imagination
I got youI wasnt born to be alone that was a lesson I was shown
To know that love was just a lie
I ran away to think it over
But its over and I try to take a stand on what is real
Someone has shown me how to feel
Im like a shadow in the night
Im like a river in an ocean
Im a flame without a light
And now Im cryin evry day
And Ive been cryin evry day
And I been think of your love
I keep turnin I keep turnin
I keep turnin I keep turnin
Well your love is a cathedral and I came down here to pray
And now Im cryin evry day
Can there be any wonder why to be living under
love is a revelation only few can share
I could be a mountain strong but the pain about you
Long as I live without you
I would still be there
I wanna die die away
Never lovenever cry
And I been walkin in the rain
And I been hangin on a dream
All the faces and the places that our love has ever been
Now Im cryin evry day
And I been cryin evry day
And I been thinkin of your love
I keep turnin I keep turnin
I keep turning I keep turnin
Well your love is a cathedral and I came down here to pray
And now Im cryin evry day
Can there be any wonder why to be living under
love is a revelation only few can share
I could be a mountain strong but the pain about you
Long as I live without you I would still be there
I wanna die die away
Never love never cry
I wasnt born to be a fool but Im a fool to be around
Im a man without a country Im a King without a crown
And then youre throwin me away
Another world another time
But if anyone belongs to anybody you were mine
And Im cryin evry day
And I been cryin evry day
And Ive been thinkin of your love
I keep turnin I keep turnin
I keep turnin I keep turning
Well your love is a cathedral and I came down here to pray
And now Im
RepeatHow did you find there was somebody
More than you want me
I never understood
Maybe I have never had you
But I have been lonely for you lately
I cant wait another day
And when you let me get you close to me
You run and leave me
Chorus
Paying the price of love
The start of my end over you
When youre doing it for someone
Wholl never be free
Now is all there will ever be
No more to live without you
All of the nights I dream about you
Oh
Deep in the dark of the night
Im a man on a mission
But safer with you home
Never would I make you sorry
You are the only drug I crave
And Ive been saving every day
I held it all inside
I pray you dont forget
Youve got me
Paying the price of love
My heart in my hands over you
But the battle is just not fair
Youll never be free
That emotion is always replaying
You know the strongest heart is broken
When it falls
You turn and walk away and let it die
Ive got this picture in my head
Of you in someone elses bed
And I am torn apart
Im torn apart inside
Ill build my world around you
I was nothing when I found you
Paying the price of love
ChorusYou been teaching me a lesson that I never learned
You never make it through a lifetime without being burned
Everything I ever thought you were - you turned out to be
Since you gave your love to me
When I met you on a monday
My life has stood still
I belong to every moment that your love can fill
Let me be the only heart you mend
Turn out the light and take it right to the end
Living with you
In the madness of my mind
In a world I could not find
But you knew what to do
Living with you
Theres a full moon on the rise
Theres a fire in your eyes
And I was born to be
Loving you under my skin
Youre everything to me
I could not love you more
And you know that you are mine
And thats what Im living for
There will never be a question of somebody new
I could make it through a lifetime with someone like you
Let me be the only heart you mend
Turn out the light and take it right to the end
Living with you
In the madness of my mind
In a world I could not find
But you knew what to do
Living with you
Theres a full moon on the rise
Theres a fire in your eyes
And I was born to be living with youWine and women and song will only make me sad
Love and kisses and hugs the things I never had
If this should end I dont mind
If this should end I will find
What shall I do
What shall I do
What shall I do
What shall I do
Cars and buses and trams make a lot of noise
All my women have gone out with other boys
If this should end I dont mind
If this should end I will find
I wont complain
I wont complain
I feel no pain
I feel no pain
Ooh if this should end I dont mind
If this should end I will find
I wont complain
I wont complain
I feel no pain
I feel no pain
Wine and women and song will only make me sad
Love and kisses and hugs the thing I never had
If this should end I dont mind
If this should end I will find
I wont complain
I wont complain
I feel no pain
I feel no pain
I wont complain cry
OohFirst I rise then I fall
Seems like you dont want the love
Of this man at all
And its sure been a lonely time
Right up to the time I met you
So if you take a love like mine
Be tender with my love
You know how easy it is to hurt me
Fanny be tender with my love
Cause its all that Ive got
And my love wont desert me
So you say to yourself boy
Youre out of your brain
Do you think Im gonna stand here
All night in the rain
And its the start of a love affair
The moment when I first met you
And if you want Ill take you there
Be tender with my love
You know how easy it is to break it
Fanny be tender with my love
Cause its all that Ive got
And my love wont forsake me
With my love
Our love will seal it together
Oh with our love
You made a promise
Youll always love me forever
Be tender with my love
You know how easy it is to break it
Fanny be tender with my love
Cause its all that Ive got
And my love wont forsake me
Be tender with my love
You know how easy it is to break it
Fanny be tender with my love
Cause its all that Ive got
And my love wont forsake me
Be tender with my love
You know how easy it is to hurt me
Fanny be tender with my love
Cause its all that Ive got
And my love wont desert me
Be tender with my love
You know how easy it is to break it
Fanny be tender with my love
Cause its all that Ive got
And my love wont desert me
Be tender with my love
You know how easy it is to hurt me
Fanny be tender with my loveby thorne lewis gibb one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-nine
Clouds grew grey when you refused to stay
The falling rain joined in with tears upon my chin
I met you it was a rendezvous
No other heart I knew could give me love so new
Years soon came between you and i
Time passed by someone else caught your eye
Heavens of clouds up above whizzing by
I look around youre not to be found
I could cry with thoughts of your goodbye
Our hearts would always fly as high as evry sky
Now I stand inside an empty land
And evrywhere I go no sweeter heart Ill knowAh I had a lot of love last night
Ah
Ah I had a lot of love last night
Ah
Ah
Ive given all my love away and Ive been left with none
But can you say that Im to blame for loving anyone
I used to think that I was always older then my time
Were all breaking promises who will cry this time
Were all breaking promises who will cry this time
Ah I had a lot of love last night
had a lot a lot of love
Ah
Ah I had a lot of love last night
had a lot a lot of love
Ah
Im casting all my dreams hereto my fish have gone to sea
And fate no longer has the faith to walk ahead of me
I always used to think that I was better then my kind
Were all breaking promises who will cry this time
Were all breaking promises who will cry this timeI wander lonely as a cloud
I keep my head above the crowd
Aint nobody else as big as me
But I must remember friends
What has to start just has to end
Everybodys got a destiny
And I know when the swallows flies
Yes I know and the earth just dies
Then Ill be told what I am
The swallow and me
Ill look after number one
Ill forget the beggars son
Everybodys got to stay alive
Ill keep a-walking amongst the clouds
Ill keep my head above the crowd
Ill watch them live Ill watch them die
And I know when the swallows flies
Yes I know and the earth just dies
Then Ill be told what I am
The swallow and meWhen the day is done and the night is near
Happiness is gone when youre not here
And all the games and songs they disappear
When the day is done
I believed in you what you were to me
Evry dream I knew became reality
And all the worlds I knew became a memory
cause I believed in you
I gave you evry thing love
Together we could bring love
I remember when I gave you
The love of a woman
The love of a woman
I believed in you what you were to me
Evry dream I knew became reality
And all the worlds I knew became a memory
cause I believed in youThere she goes my daytime girl
Spreading her wings like a high flying eagle
All the people will stare as she falls to the ground
Heaven knows my daytime girl
Never been kissed she dont know what shes missing
All the kisses there are to be found
All the wisdom of people she used
She took advantage of this
Taking time to remember the past
Remembering all she has missed
What a dream this place has been
Said when she left I believed when I saw him
All the seeing believing come true
All the wisdom of people she used
She took advantage of this
Taking time to remember the past
Remembering all she has missed
There she goes my daytime girl
Spreading her wings like a high flying eagle
All the people will stare as she falls to the groundBaby I cant figure it out
Your kisses taste like honey
Sweet lies dont gimme no rise
Oh oh what youre trying to do
Livin on your cheatin
And the pain grows inside me
Its enough to leave me crying in the rain
Love you forever but youre
Driving me insane
And Im hanging on
Oh oh Ill win Ill never give in
Our love has got the power
Too many lovers in one lifetime
Aint good for you
You treat me like a vision in the night
Someone there to stand behind you
When your world aint working right
I aint no vision I am the man
Who loves you inside out
Backwards and forwards with
My heart hanging out
I love no other way
What am I gonna do if we lose that fire
Wrap myself up and take me home again
Too many heartaches in one
Lifetime aint good for me
I figure its the love that keeps you warm
Let this moment be forever
We wont ever feel the storm
I aint no vision I am the man
Who loves you inside out
Backwards and forwards with
My heart hanging out
I love no other way
What am I gonna do if we lose that fire
Dont try to tell me its all over
I cant hear a word I cant hear a line
No man could love you more
And thats what Im cryin for
You cant change the way I feel inside
Youre the reason for my laughter and my sorrow
Blow out the candle I will burn again tomorrow
No man on earth can stand
Between my love and I
And no matter how you hurt me
I will love you till I die
I aint no vision I am the man
Who loves you inside out
Backwards and forwards with
My heart hanging out
I love no other way
What am I gonna do if we lose that fire
Loves you inside out
Backwards and forwards with
My heart hanging out
I love no other way
What am I gonna do if we lose that fire
Loves you inside out
Backwards and forwards with
My heart hanging out

I was held by your heart
And no secrets stood between us anymore

And my darling I was lost in your love
Theres been a diffrence of opinion to the way Ive been treating you
But you know that Ive tried to apologize
for all the bad times Ive put you through
On the chance that I could make you mine
Theres not a thing I would not do
And wrong or right Ill be with you and lost in your love
I was lost in your love
I was held by your heart
And no secrets stood between us anymore
Im like a child learning pain

And my darling I was lost in your love
Now I will follow you where the wild bird flies
Through endless skies I will go
So I can be so near you girl and all of this you gotta know
That when I get you here inside my arms
I never ever ever will let you go
And wrong or right Ill be with you and lost in your loveYou say its better to behave
Just like I never met you
Why is it only I can cry
And you can say goodbye in a minute
Dont you remember I was your friend
And you can just erase all those days
And those tender reflections we bear
We promised not to fall in love
But it was there and soon I was in it
Already I was more than your friend
Its harder for me
No words or expressions
Can make you hungry for me
Ive never seen you on your knees
Like Im beggin you
Dont give up give up on each other
Back where we started
No love to hold us down
Ill never give another anymore than I gave to you
Will never come around
Always and always
You told me love ever and ever
Together the dream will come true
If we turn back
If you turn back to me
You wont be sorry if you stay
Ill stake my life upon it
Little flame inside us can be fed
Take our precious love to the limit
Its the one that you need and its your friend
Its harder for me
No words or expressions
Anything that makes you worry
Ive never seen you on your knees
And Im in a hurry
How is it you can break my heart
But you cant be sorry
Push away whoever you please
But Im begging you
Dont give up give up on each other
Back where we started
No love to hold us down
Ill never give another
Anymore than I gave to you
Will never come around oh
Dont give up give up on each other
We cant lose tomorrow

You may not know but I do miss you earnestly
Of all the moments in our time theres none like this
And evry day when our lips met theres none so bliss

How can I meet other girls when you wont let me go
My hearts still in a whirl and gee I feel so low
I dont know why I feel this way
Id like to leave if I may
I cant go to play you have got a hold on me
You make me work all day
Why dont you set me free
Youre on my mind almost all hours of the day
Id like to leave if I may
Its plain to see that I dont need ya anymore
Why dont you stay beside and let me through the door
I know that in my life Ive made one big mistake
Youll only hurt me more if we dont make the break
Im telling you so hear what I say
Id like to leave if I may
Its plain to see that I dont need ya anymore
Why dont you stay beside and let me through the door
I know that in my life Ive made one big mistake
Youll only hurt me more if we dont make the break
Im telling you so hear what I say
Id like to leave if I mayIts a circle
I believe in change for the better girl
Those ebony eyes
Does love only seem to be satisfied
And in a world that lives without it
It makes the safest medicine
And all the summer nights
And you know that I know
I dream about you and I wont let go
And its been so long
And I cant go on
Its my destiny
And I must be strong
You know its all right
And it may be wrong
My destiny
And I must go on
Ooh hold you til the sun comes out
Ooh smother me
I must be insane in love
To let you treat me like a fool
Kinder to be cruel of you gotta lie
By your side
Thats the place to be seen
til the day I die
Ooh I did nothin to start it
Im just an aimless passenger
And all the summer nights
Ive been lost to the storm
I dream about you
And it keeps me warm
And its been so long
And I cant go on
Its my destiny
And I must be strong
You know its all right
And it may be wrong
My destiny
And I must go on
Make me tremble when Im seeing you
Im born to live through the pain again
Im moving high and low
Im gonna get you but I dont know whenBabe
It seems every night and day I get to lose
And I always held the faith inside
That love would find a way
And I always reached for more
Than the others ever saw
I was always the first to follow
My foolish prayer
And the feelings that I have are more than
Any soul can bare
Only when I wake
Then I can be sure of who I am
Im half the man I should be
When youre gone and youre telling me
This is love but just in case
I keep my heart in a secret place
Safe under lock and key
Til I know its only me
One of us got to be the one thats true
One for the other and the love comes through
Right here or out in space
Give my heart to youbabe
But just in case just in case
Tell the world that I come to claim
Your tomorrows
Let the universal word go out
A million miles away
And history has shown
that when the seed is sown
We are livig in a time when the tears fall
Where they might
But we hear each other much more than those who
See
We are not alone
Love is there for everyone who needs
And for anyone who cries
And I will alaways have you here with me
And youre telling me
This is love but just in case
Keep my heart in a secret place
Safe under lock and key
Til I know its only me
One of us got to be the one thats true
One for the other and the love comes through
Yoursmine and face to face
Give my heart to youbabe
But just in caseJust before you break my heart
I feel that there is something I must say
Before you go your way
Go on have your fun and see if you can break
Their hearts like me big man youll never understand
That a girl needs to love and be loved as i
Both your hearts should be in the sky
And you know that its true you know that its true
When it happens to you when it happens to you
Though I really care for you
I think its only fair for you to try
Go ahead and say goodbye
Maybe one day when you fall I think that i
Shall tell them all and so oh maybe then youll know
That a girl needs to love and be loved as i
Both your hearts should be in the sky
And you know that its true you know that its true
When it happens to you when it happens to you
break
Go on have your fun and see
If you can break their hearts like me
Big man youll never understand
That a girl needs to love and be loved as i
Both your hearts should be in the sky
And you know that its true you know that its true
When it happens to you when it happens to you Its another woman
Hey it could be me it could be anyone
Yeah she got the energy to blind the sun
And she make me glow
She sparkle and I see the light
I miss her every moment she is out of sight
Shes a necessity
My baby keeps rolling me
Watch her glide
This girl is bonafide
Shes got what causes chaos
Shes got the power that I cant explain
Blowing through each other like a hurricane
Look at me Im twenty-seven stories high
There may be somebody else and
I dont want to live like that
No I dont want to live like that
Dont want to live like that
No I dont want to live like that live like that
Just another voice in the wilderness
Stick with me forever
Cross my heart and hope to die
You should give me everything and so will I
And the world will know
I say I will not lie
You know more lovers than one for some become a necessity
My baby keeps rolling me
Live on stage
Exposing my jealous rage
Life can be complicated
I give you something you can talk about
Love is like a prison and you cant get out
These things are hard to find
You say the world is flat but
I dont want to live like that
No I dont want to live like that
Dont want to live like that
No I dont want to live like that live like that
Just another voice in the wilderness
Walking through the fire
Running like a river til the race is won
Im risking everything to be someone
I will stick by you
We know but we will not fail
Lifting of the spirit and the flesh prevails
And the fight is on
This love it keeps rolling on
Watch me fly
Into the clear blue sky
This is the age of wonder
I am the one
I dont want to live like that
No I dont want to live like that
I dont want to live like that live like that
Just another voice in the wildernessIn my mind talk about rebecca suddenly so fine

He sure shall find the weariness and dreariness of life thats growing thin
Yet he didnt have so very far to go
With a pencil in his hand he will travel on as planned
With a mere step in the mountain to a light
Craise Finton Kirk see him go on his way
Oh they dont know where he is
Very very nice very very nice
Even in the morning when he slept
Something odd is missing
Theres nothing very much to talk about
And nothing very much to see
Craise Finton Kirk see him go on his way
Oh they dont know where he is
Very very nice very very nice
Talks about the place hed like to go
And you never see the worrying and hurrying and that makes a person slow
Yet you wouldnt think hed be so hard to find
Yet he looks so very busy but theres nothing on his mind
And his wavy hair continues not to grow
Craise Finton Kirk see him go on his way
Oh they dont know where he is
Very very nice very very nice
Craise Finton Kirk see him go on his way
Oh they dont know where he is
Very very nice very very niceThe preacher talked to me and he smiled
Said Come and walk with me come and walk one more mile

There is something I would like you all to see
Its just a photograph of someone that I knew
Have you seen my wife Mr Jones
Do you know what its like on the outside
Dont go talking too loud youll cause a landslide Mr Jones
I keep straining my ears to hear a sound
Maybe someone is digging underground
Or have they given up and all gone home to bed
Thinking those who once existed must be dead
Have you seen my wife Mr Jones
Do you know what its like on the outside
Dont go talking too loud youll cause a landslide Mr Jones
In the event of something happening to me
There is something I would like you all to see

Dont go talking too loud youll cause a landslide Mr JonesSo many things that you could say or do
Dont wanna say goodbye
So many nights that I would cry for you
But you were cold as ice
Now Im searching for
Someone I can be sure of
Sacrifice the only one that I need
No hideaway for the runaway
Every creature of love had excited me
Someone is breaking your heart heart heart
So tomorrow Ill tell you that Im sorry
And its too late to worry if
Someone is breaking your heart heart heart
Just an echo of a distant dream
That slowly disappears in the
Magic of the ecstasy
That flows between the tears
Then before my eyes the crystal was broken
I swallowed every promise you made
No hideaway for the runaway
Every creature of love had excited me
Someone is breaking your heart heart heart
So tomorrow Ill tell you that Im sorry
And its too late to worry if
Someone is breaking your heart heart heart
Moonlight is cruel as the light
And the future is only a lie
Oh baby
Birds of a feather will fly
Im alone in the night
No hideaway for the runaway
Every creature of love had excited me
Someone is breaking your heart heart heart
So tomorrow Ill tell you that Im sorry
And its too late to worry if
Someone is breaking your heart heart heart
So tomorrow Ill tell you that Im sorry fadeAll the kings horses and all the kings men
Couldnt put me back together again
My heart lies in pieces all over the ground
Whos gonna help me when youre not around
And I know inside me that nobody cares
Whatever happens to me
I live my life as a plea
All the kings horses and all the kings men
Couldnt put me back together again
I was in love when I sat on my wall
No one could hurt me no one at all
And I know that somewhere my love walked away
She threw my love to the sky
Nothing to do but to cry
All the kings horses and all the kings men
Couldnt put me back together again
All the kings horses all the kings horses
All the kings horses all the kings horsesMy mind is open now Im on the other side
Though you remember my name
And if you go away Ill get it off somehow
Ill leave it all in the air Nono
Turn me down Repeat 
Oh how Ive tried
Really and sincerely Ive tried
There is a song I hear it all around
But I dont hear a sound
If you were with me nowId let you know my mind
Love is so easy to lose Nono
Turn me down Repeat 
Oh how Ive tried
Really and sincerelyWatch what you say to that girl that I love
You best be true or Ill be seeing you
Dont tell her lies say things to make her cry
I Ill be there so you best beware
I love that girl she is the girl
For her I would die
Dont fool around or Ill break you down if you try
You gotta watch what you say
Dont you dare hurt my love
I Im still the one
And Ill be here when youre gone
break
I love that girl she is the girl
For her I would die
Dont fool around or Ill break you down if you try
You gotta watch what you say
Dont you dare hurt my love
I Im still the one
And Ill be here when youre gone
OhohohohThis is the life you saved laid out before you
Everything that I think I have been and what I am now
Nothing can change the way I feel about you
Better we go on our separate ways
Nothing is left but the endless days
Nothing to cry but your name
Dont you look back dont say a word
I will be lonely for you I will be standing for you
Dont you despair
I will be there for you
Farewell to you goodbye for me
I will be waiting for you I will be lonely for you
Dont you despair
I will be there for you
Ohh ohh
I will be there
Ohh ohh
I will be there
Maybe this time next year well be together
You can wipe away all of the tears bring truth to the lies
There was a silent dream we made a promise
Wed be there for each other forever
Borne like a ship on the oceans roar
Beating a path to your open door
Nothing will keep me away
Dont you look back dont say a word
I will be lonely for you I will be standing for you
Dont you despair
I will be there for you
Each night I pray to God above
You will be waiting for me you will be lonely for me
Dont you despair
I will be there for you
Ohh ohh
I will be there
Ohh ohh
I will be there
Ohh ohh
I will be there
Ohh ohh
I will be there
Ohh ohh
I will beYou and me were both the same
In this life a lonely game
I used to be a happy man
And now I understand just what its all about
I never had a doubt on the chance of love
As a boy I lived down here
I always saw you near
To be together was happiness
And I just cant forget the moment we first kissed
Id like to try again on the chance of love
Yeah on the chance of love
Ill do anything to get you by my side
On the sound of love I will love you girl
Youll be mine
All the world would then be free
An apple falls from an apple tree
You and I will be together
And you will understand when I take your hand
Ill open up the door to the chance of loveIf your heart tells you so that you should leave me
Dont try to forget you and I never met
And before you fly one kiss should tell me why
Youve forgotten all the words that you once said
Long as Ive got you there beside me
Long as youre there to stand and guide me
The love we share no one can ever tear apart
Long as Ive got this life Im living
Long as its you the love Im with then
Ill keep on calling you sweetheart
If my love for you cant make you happy
Just open the door and you wont see my anymore
And before you fly one kiss should tell me why
Youve forgotten all the words that you once said
When you said
Long as Ive got you there beside me
Long as youre there to stand and guide me
The love we share no one could ever tear apart
Long as Ive got this life Im living
Long as its you the love Im with then
Ill keep on calling you sweetheartWhen I see you out of sight
I dont care to feel all right
I just dont like to be alone
When you walk away from me
Leave this man in misery
I just dont like to be alone
And when Im holding you
I find the things you do
When Im with you
Im not blue Im not blue
When I see you out of sight
I dont care to feel all right
I just dont like to be alone
And when Im holding you
I find the things you do
When Im with you
Im not blue Im not blue
When I see you out of sight
I dont care to feel all right
I just dont like to be alone
I just dont like to be alone
I just dont like to be aloneWritten by rm gibbr lawrence
With these words we speak of love
Its hard for us to end
Its all a fallacy
That people do pretend
Release one
The changes that I see
I tremble and I shake
Were down in history
For only one mistake
Chorus
So far so good
So far so good
Twentieth century sole survivor
So far so good
No neighbourhood
I cant escape your fire
I wont be far away
Dont worry about the night
And I will take away
The trouble in your life
Release two
When danger follows
It will take you by surprise
No desert island
You can run to when you hide
Chorus
Bridge
Its such a tragedy
To fight for what we cannot win
And all our golden days are gone foreverI wasnt very happy when you let me down
Still Ive made my own decision
Im gonna get back to the people put my faith around
Back with the people get up off the ground
Livin life was easy when you were by my side
Now youre gone its too much effort
Now Im gonna get back to the people put my faith around
When youre back with the people nothing brings you down
Im gonna get back with the people put my faith around
When youre back with the people nothing brings you down
Using what Ive learned and living what I preach
Makes the hard thing very easy
Now Im gonna get back to the people put my faith around
When youre back with the people nothing brings you downSomeone keeps on telling me how much he loves me so
Writes it on the wall outside so I will always know
Whos been writing on the wall again
Whos been writing on the wall again
Whos been writing on the wall again
Lori I love you lori I love you
Evry evening I come home its waiting there for me
Three little words one little voice someone I cant see
Whos been writing on the wall again
Whos been writing on the wall again
Whos been writing on the wall again
Lori I love you lori I love you
Is he tall or is he small
I wonder what his game is
I wish hes write it on the wall
And tell me what his name is
I dont know if his hair is blonde or if his eyes are blue
But I know that when I meet him im gonna love him too
Whos been writing on the wall again
Whos been writing on the wall again
Whos been writing on the wall again
Lori I love you lori I love you
Is he tall or is he small
I wonder what his game is
I wish hed write it on the wall
And tell me what his name is
I dont know if his hair is blonde or if his eyes are blue
But I know that when meet him Im gonna love him too
Whos been writing on the wall again
Whos been writing on the wall again
Whos been writing on the wall again
Lori I love you lori I love you
Whos been writing on the wall again
Whos been writing on the wall again fadeInstrumental onlyA child that hides behind a chair
Almost afraid to grow without you there
Whisper words that make you see
What youve come to mean to me
A voice that rises from the heart
The hunger that seizes me
And tears my soul apart
And serving only to renew
How I came to feel for you
Through your love Id seen
Forever we became as one
I never saw you turn away
My love was blind
You call me when your storm is over
Crying over love that I can give you
When the night is the colder
Holding on to me
Cause its so hard letting go
And its so hard not to cry
With your face that lies
You memorize the reason why
And when love is gone
Then one of us will know
Its so hard letting go
Foolish that I still believe
That love should never die
It makes me cry to witness
Where the story ends
All the lovers in the world will
Echo all the words that I will leave you
When the night is lonely
Only goes to show
That its so hard letting go
And its so hard not to cry
And I kneel for yesterday
When you were mine
And when the love is gone
Then one of us will know
Its so hard letting goThere are times that I should go away
To think of you and I
For it isnt only now I need your love
All of my life all of my life
In the night time when I lie awake
And think of you in my heart
For it isnt only now I need your love
All of my life all of my life
Oh wouldnt you believe me if I told you
That I love you and I do
Everyone believes me when I tell them
Why dont you why dont you
When I think of things that ought to be
And I feel your hand in mine
Yes it isnt only now I need your love
All of my life all of my life
All of my life all of my life
Oh wouldnt you believe if I told you
That I love you and I do
Everyone believes me when I tell them
Why dont you why dont you
When I think of things that ought to be
And I feel your hand in mine
Yes it isnt only now I need your love
All of my life all of my life
All of my life Repeat Oooo every day you make me cry girl
I cry too much
And today you say goodbye girl
its just too much
Hey I swallowed each and every lie that you gave to me
Where lies the man that I was and the future that could never be
Chorus
Tomorrow every one gonna know me better
And tomorrow every one gonna drink my wine
Andtomorrow every one gonna read my letter
and my story of love and a love that could never be mine
Oooo Ask you to be my wife girl You were playing
Now I ask you where is my life girl You were saying
Hey I swallowed each and every lie that you gave to me
Where lies the man that I was and the future that could never be
Chorus
And
ChorusAnother lonely monday morning and I dont want to face the world outside
No control
You got someone there to make you smile
But I cry alone
Givin those secret feeling
You never cooperate share your love with me
I try in vain to seize your heart
Please dont keep me waiting for that sign
Give me one good reason why you say goodnight and mean goodbye
Please let me
Let me wake up in your arms
Let me go down in your dreams
There is so much we can do before tomorrow and what tomorrow means
I want to get close to you
Every single word I swear is true
On bended kneesi beg you
Let me wake up in your arms
Its gotta be now or never that heaven in your eyes
You touch me hand and I just die
If you got no one there to see you through Im standing by

Another lonely monday morning and I dont want to face the truth inside
cause youre not mine
Maybe Ive been reachin far too high

But I wont let you forget me let me
Let me wake up in your arms

Baby I want to get close to you
Every single word I swear is true
On bended knees I beg you
Let me wake up in your arms
Nobody wants to sleep aloneWe take each other and walk through the open door
From the first time that I saw you
To the way you look tonight
I was shaken by your spirit
I was blinded by your light
And the world that I used to see is gone without a trace
Replaced by your eyes and the smile upon your face
And I will not turn away
cause you might disappear
I was haunted by your heart
And I felt that you were here
And funny when the time is right
When lightning strikes
Youre not alone
Baby I will pray for you my whole life through
This day
Well be together
Husband and wife
Now and forever
The rest of our lives
Well take me to heaven ah
Take me tonight ah
There is nothing words can say
On this our wedding day
Oh now is the hour now is the sowing of the seed
I will take tomorrow
I will lay it at your feet
And the two of us escape from the sadness of the world
From the thunder and the darkness
From the hunger and the hurt
You know I will remember well the mission bell
That rings your name
And baby there could never be
A memory like you
Well be together ah
Husband and wife ah
Now and forever ah
Lovers for life oh
Well take me to heaven ah
Take me tonight ah
There is nothing words can say
On this our wedding day
This is my pledge to you

And we will find another plane
Well be home again
And tonight Im going to find true love true love
Well be together
Husband and wife
Now and forever
Lovers for life

Take me tonight ah
There is nothing words can say
On this our wedding day
This our wedding dayLook at me I dont know what Im doin
Ever since I looked at you
How did I get this crazy feelin
Could it be Im in love with you
Ever since I saw you in the moonlight
Ive had this feeling through and through
Since that time I havent done a thing right
Could it be Im in love with you
Golly gee I dont know where Im goin

break
Golly gee I dont know where Im goin
Im tryin to make you see
Oh boy I got to make her fall in love with me
Night after night Im always dreamin
Why dont you make those dreams come true
Cant you see how much I really love you
Why dont you learn to love me too
Love me too
Love me tooI thought Id already touched the sky
I got to know you and I dont know why
But all of my life couldnt mean as much
As just being touched by you
I never thought of me growing up
Got my directions but the road was rough
Its only the dream of a teenage queen
But somehow I made it through
And Id love to see
Those faces of those friends I left behind
And even those who spoke for me
Just trying to be kind
And no one said I love you just the way
I know you do
and I love being in love with you
Living inside your heart
The giving and the taking
You are not forsaken
I love being in love with you
Thank you just for choosing me
That we should be
Being in love forever
I stare and wonder at what I found
I just discovered why the world is round
Round in a circle my arms will be
And doing the same as you
It aint right its only for you and me
Only the lonely so it seperately
Keep it alive on the food of love
But only the chosen few
In my life you see some changes in me
We listen and we grow
Any child that clings to childish things
Is trying to let go
And up to now
Id thought Id seen as far as I could see
repeat twice and fade outHere comes the night again
Nights that ever end
Aint got no friend to guide me anymore believe me
I just want your heart
Were two roads apart
To walk on the white sands with you forever more
Mando bay mando bay where the happy children play
Where my heart just longs to stay
Im going home to mando bay
One more night with you
Paradise on blue
Well walk on the sand and Ill fall in love with you
You know my arms are open wide
I cant wait so long
Till I walk on the white sand with you by my side
Mando bay mando bay where the happy children play
Where my heart just longs to stay
Im going home to mando bay
Here comes the night again
Nights that never end
Aint got no friend to guide me anymore believe me
I will be right there
The sunshine in your hair
To walk on the white sands with you forever more
Mando bay mando bay where the happy children play
Where she longs for me to stay
Im going home to mando bay
Mando bay mando bay where the happy children play
Where she longs for me to stay

And now I sit on the sand hill
I sing our song to the sea

Beckoning hands made you fly

In august october the grass grew
The sky was blue and I want you
Now as I look out my window
I see the world carry on

Beckoning hands made you fly

Flowers in the meadow in the morning light
You know satisfy the song inside
And the dream is making you care everybody smiles
And the dream is taking you there
Theres a little bit of heaven on the village green
And the Bunbury Eleven that you never see
And they take all comers in the month of June
On a Friday Saturday Sunbury afternoon
On a Friday Saturday Bunbury afternoon
On a Friday Saturday Bunbury afternoon
They all say it couldnt be real
Shakin their head in wonder
Makin it long drive home
And when the sun and the moment is gone
Breakin that spell were under
We played a part in the heart of a beautiful memory
Theres a baby in a cradle and a wise old man
Young lovers happy to be hand in hand
Everybody finds their way they will learn the secret in time
Theres a ring on her finger and a love that shows
And the Bunbury Eleven say the rumor goes
They re married in the church in the month of June
On a Friday Saturday Sunbury afternoon
On a Friday Saturday Bunbury afternoon
On a Friday Saturday Bunbury afternoon
Theres a wind in the willows when the day is done
People disappearing in the golden sun
You know everybody smiles
Theres a little bit of heaven onLittle child I have found
If I stood up and looked around
Id see a brand new face staring right back at me
I believe I am sure
That Im taller then I was before
Building a brand new bridge into sincerity
But its the times like this we must learn to grow
Throw a penny for my children they are going down
When the light shines down much brighter many souls are found
And cant believe what theyre saying in the overground
Throw a penny for my children going down
Listen to the wise man as he breathes
Hes really loving me loving me
He must be loving me loving me
At night I turn my face into the wind
And I whisper secretly what means the most to me
And bring him close
Make it bad make it good
Make it easy to be understood
I see a velvet day breaking across the sky
I believe I am sure
I am taller then I was before
Building a brand new bridge
I know Im gonna try
But its the times like this we must find out why
Throw a penny for my children they are going down
When the light shines down much brighter many souls are found
And I cant believe what theyre saying in the overground
Throw a penny for my children going down
Throw a penny for my children for my children going down
Throw a penny for my children for my children going down
Throw a penny for my children for my children going down
Throw a penny for my children for my children going down fadeYou could read her lips well as I was able
She was into taking you where you aint been
I was looking in at the stroke of twelve
She came in the back door
You could see her climb the stairs
And the two of us we wait we wait
Ill cover you girl I cover you
Cover you with
Cover you with kisses
Shower you with love
Twist you up and turn you round
All night all night
Cover you with kisses
Taste you with my tongue
Live on itchy fingers
All night long all night
You could see her legs underneath the table
You could see the burn was on when she moved on you
I think I went insane when the flesh is weak
The more that we discover
If we only trust just the two of us
You play me you play me
Ill cover you girl I cover you
Cover you with
Cover you with kisses
Taste you with my tongue
Live on itchy fingers
All night long all night
Born to make love she was
To get up you go down
Its easy
Cover you with kisses
Shower you with love
Twist you up and turn you round
All night all night
Cover you with kisses
Taste you with my tongue
Live on itchy fingers
All night long all nightNo you cant keep a good man down
When you got a good woman to keep it up
No you cant stand on firmer ground
When love is the question I got enough
Ooh with lips so sweet
Our love just cant be beat my darling oh yeah
A love like yours and mine
Can stand the test of time my darling oh yeah
But for tomorrow -- tomorrow never comes
Love is the secret -- goes living on
No you cant keep a good man down
When you got a good woman to keep it up
No you cant stand on firmer ground
When love is the question I got enough
Just when I need you show me the way
You came into my world -- turned my night to day
What good is a man without a woman
But for the trouble -- trouble always comes
Love is the secret -- goes living on
No you cant keep a good man down
When you got a good woman to keep it up
No you cant stand on firmer ground
When love is the question I got enough
Ooh your love is strong
Keep me forever youre my darling oh yeah
A love like yours and mine
Can stand the test of time my darling oh yeah
But for tomorrow -- tomorrow never comes
Love is the secret -- goes living on
No you cant keep a good man down
When you got a good woman to keep it up
No you cant stand on firmer ground
When love is the question Ive got enoughNow it is dawn and a new day is born
But with a trail of despair
The new day was shining but many had gone
Farmer Ferdinand Hudson had lost much more than hed won
He sat by a table and cried in his rum
The cobwebs hung heavy and dreary beside
All that looked at him could barely decide
He passed for one day so to sleep in that night
And early that morning he diedIm a mine of information
Im a stranger to the cause
I been watchin you watchin me babe
But the words I had are lost
Just wanna be everything you need babe
And Im begging you to say in my heart
A room with a view
Theres only a fool there
I will never give up never give up never give up
I will never give up never give up never give up
I will follow you home
How can you turn me away
Did you ever get hungry or thirsty
With a dream to satisfy
You dont wanna be safe from being lonely
But youre throat is kinda dry
Did you ever get senseless or defenseless
An exception to the rule
Aint nobody pushin you but youre rushin in
And Im beggin you to stay in my heart
Whatever it takes to make you belong there
I will never give up never give up never give up
I will never give up never give up never give up
Love knows no other way
Being together and hearing you say youll be mine
Youre my world
And Ill be forever yours
Did you ever get hungry or thirsty
With a dream to satisfy
You dont wanna be safe from bein lonely
But youre throat is kinda dry
Did you ever get senseless or defenseless
An exception to the rule
Aint nobody pushin you but youre rushin in
And Im beggin you to stay in my heart
Whatever it takes to make you belong there
I will never give up never give up never give up
I will never give up never give up never give up
I will follow you home
How can you turn me awayYou stepped into my life
And Im oh so happy
You stepped into my life
Stepped into my life
Stepped into my life
And Im oh so happy
You stepped into my life

Before you came my way
I always checked this out
So much pain in love
And so alone inside
I never thought
That Id believe in love so much
But darling when you came close to me
Suddenly suddenlyLove me
Just a little bit longer
Love me
I remember times my love
When we really had it all
You were always there to make me smile
To help me when I fall
Ooh I cant believe youre leaving me
When theres so much more to say
I cant let you go
Ooh Every time I look at you
I still can feel the glow
Let it be let it grow
Ooh Love me please
Just a little bit longer
Together we can make it
Our love is much too young to break it
Love me please
Just a little bit harder
Together we can make it
Our love is much too young to break it
Oh all I ever wanted was
To have you to myself
Then I see you standing there
In the arms of someone else
Ooh You know a girl can stand so much
And its more than I can fake
I cant let you go
Ooh every time I look at you
I still can feel the glow
Let it be let it grow
Ooh Love me please
Just a little bit longer
Together we can make it
Our love is much
Too young to break it
Love me please
Just a little bit harder
Never even tried to see things my way
Its hard on a woman
When love aint no love at all
And when you walk away
From me baby youre gonna be sorry
Im begging you please
Love me please love me love me
Just a little bit longer
Together we can make it
Our love is much too young to break it
Love me please just a little bit harder
Just a little bit harder just a little bit harder
Together we can make it
Our love is much too young to break it
Love me please just a little bit longerLala I got a letter in this town

LalaI do not need you
Nor do I listen to the words you say
Strongly I heed you
But every promise seems to fade away
Who is the clown that walks in the steps of my shadow
Is it the man who does what he can but never does it right
How can I prove
There is no reasoning or asking why
Only to prove
I love you deeply with the sun in my eyes
Who is the clown that walks in the steps of my shadow
Is it the man who does what he can but never does it right
How can I prove

Borne on the wind
Alls fair in love and in war
Steady and sure

When the dream is gone
Its a lonelier place
I kiss the morning goodbye
But down inside you know
We never know why
The road is narrow and long
When eyes meet eyes
And the feeling is strong
I turn away from the wall
I stumble and fall
But I give you it all
I am a woman in love
And I do anything
To get you into my world
And hold you within
Its a right I defend
Over and over again
What do I do
With you eternally mine
In love there is
No measure of time
We planned it all at the start
That you and I
Would live in each others hearts
We may be oceans away
You feel my love
I hear what you say
No truth is ever a lie
I stumble and fall
But I give you it all
I am a woman in love
And I do anything
To get you into my world
And hold you within
Its a right I defend
Over and over again

I close my eyes and I see you there
Shower me my precious love
With all the good things two people can share
When it seems like the sky is falling
I need you near me so desperately
cause we forget so easily
All the magic two people can be
Being lonely makes it oh so hard for me to carry onOh though I know youre so far away
Im reaching for you needing you both night and day
Sometimes a man finds out too lateThat life slips by each moment we live
cause we dont know how rare it is
All the loving two people can give
break
And though I know youre so far away
Im reaching for you needing you both night and day
If theres a time I feel downhearted
I close my eyes and I see you there
Shower me my precious love
With all the good things two people can share
When it seems like the sky is fallingI need you near me so desperately
cause we forget so easily
All the magic two people can be

You hurt me and you fool around
You dont even give me a chance
Well its over and Im telling you

Saying what you dont really mean
Now I know where you go and all the plans you made
Playing for a love not a dream
All that I want is you now and somehow I let you down
Lost in my pain that where I lie
You got to stop think again before you give it to him
Stop baby one of us got to lose
You gotta stop think again before you lost the heaven
Stop baby one of us got to try
Oh its a great big world that we live in
Pleasure and pain thats where I lie
You got to stop think again before you give it to him
Stop baby one of us got to try
Midnight you leave me taking the part of me
That loves you like he loves you only more
Birds crymy sky falls
Darkness becomes my life he got you
I got nothing to be living forIm not a ghost I am a man
I only do the best I can
Believin I will find a way
Its just a price that you must pay
For my friends they put me down
So I go from town to town
They all say that Im a clown
They play high and I play
They play high and I play
I play the game I see the light
I walk in day you walk in night
Believe me boy it aint no good
In doin what you never should
All my friends they put me down
So I go from town to town
They all say that Im a clown
They play high and I play down
They play high and I play

All my friends they put me down
So I go from town to town
They all say that Im a clown
They play high and I play down
They play high and I playb gibb
Now Ive been accused of going hollywood
Chasing some cinematic schemes
But Ill give you panavision pictures
If you give me technicolour dreams
I never thought in terms of growing old
Nothing is ever as it seems
But Ill give you panavision pictures
cause you give me technicolour dreams
Up there walking on air
Id like to show you how
I loved you way back then
As much as I need you now
Some people like to send the world away
Some sunlight on some silver beams
And Ill give you panavision pictures
cause you give me technicolour dreams
Oh wow look at us now
All of our dreams fulfill
I would implore you still
From under your windowsill
Sometimes Id like to send the world away
Some sunlight on some silver beams
So Ill give you panavision pictures
cause you give me technicolour dreams
Technicolour dreams
Ill give you panavision pictures
cause you give me technicolour dreams
Go far follow your star
Ill help you climb that hill
I would adore you still
From under your windowsill
Sometimes Id like to send the world away
Some sunlight on some silver beams
So Ill give you panavision pictures
cause you give me technicolour dreams
Technicolour dreamsSee the children play the ball
See them play along the hall
It makes me cry to see them smile
I see the moon I see the sky
I see reflections in my eyes
And theres no one to share my life
I need a life to go my way
So every night I pray
Just give me someone for my life
I feel a clown
People try to play me down
And theres one thing I never found
The sound of love
See the old man walk the lane
See him walk along in pain
It makes me cry to see them smile
I watch the moon I watch the sky
I see reflections in my eyes
And theres no one to share my life
I need a life to go my way
So every night I pray
Just give me someone for my life
I feel a clown
People try to play me down
And theres one thing I never found
The sound of love
The sound of love
Everybody loves the sound of love RepeatsNight grows cold
Ive been lonely so much
Out of reach
Save it only for me
Nothing in life is the same
And the sooner we stop to start
And theres a heart like mine
Somewhere in this world
Theres a heart like mine
Beating but left to burn
Maybe you can hide your face forever
And God knows its true
That when you search for someone
Theres a heart like mine
Theres a heart like mine
To be heard to be heard
Souls on fire
Feel her voice in your ear
She goes on
Living only for me
Nothing you say could be wrong
Cause you give me the lovers sign
And theres a heart like mine
Somewhere in this world
Theres a heart like mine
Beating but left to burn
Maybe we can share it all forever
But not til we do
Im gonna search for someone
Theres a heart like mine
Theres a heart like mine
To be heard to be heard
And baby are we waking up together
Cause God knows its you
If there is love for someone
And theres a heart like mine
Somewhere in this world
Theres a heart like mine
Beating but left to burn
Maybe we can share it all forever
But not til we do
Im gonna search for someone
Theres a heart like mine
Theres a heart like mine
To be heard to be heard
Theres a heart like mine
Theres a heart like mineTake hold of that star I give to you
And tell me that you love me
Just as I love you
Take hold of that star and put it in your locket
And tell me that you love me
Just as I love you
Chorus
Id give you the moon or the sun
or the starlights with a love so true
And if it rains Ill give you a rainbow too
Take hold of that star and put it in your locket
And tell me that you love me
Just as I love you
ChorusIm a fool Ive taken no advice
And Im so cruel Im talkin to you nice
But then again you may not take me back
Oh just to put my hat back on your rack
Guess I dont know why I bother with myself
You will find a part of me in someone else
I never argued with the fact that she is mine
I only hurt her and kissed her three times out of nine
You have the edge to talk to men and make them feel at home
You spent that every lasting cent on someone thats not your own
Bear with me theres bound to be a chance
To heal the wound and start back our romance
I gained a heart and part of it is yours
Oh just to see my love walk through these doors
Oh and my lifes bound out ahead I can not look
And if you read me then I am just a book
You dont care if rain falls in my room
You wont be there if trouble fills my spoon
Im just a clown that plays around with misery in my way
Forgetting all the rules of love fadeWhat would I say if you should turn away from me
I do not know if there are words that I can see
I only know that I am reaching too high
And who are we to touch the wind
And say our ship is coming in
The turning tide
Tell me the answer in your changing mind changing mind
I dont know if love can last
When time is gone and we are on the roundabout
Would you still laugh and be a clown when love runs out
Or will you say that I am reaching too high
And who are we to touch the wind
And say our ship is coming in
The turning tide
And who are we to touch the the wind
And say our ship is coming in
The turning tideJust one more night my love
And all that we believe becomes a lie
And loneliness will disappear
With the tears we cried
How could you leave me believin
That its too late to be
All the love the love we were
How can you turn me away
When I stumble in
Help me break your dream of her
I wonder why its goin wrong
Never understood the meaning all along
Somehow I believe in evrything
Came the warning light
And the story ends
And Im in love with you baby
Just one more night my love
And all that we believe becomes a lie
And loneliness will disappear
With the tears we cried
Would you be leaving tomorrow for someone else
While I die for you inside
Can there be one of us anyone feel no pain
Dont it hurt to say goodbye
It must be right to let it end
Im playin with pieces of my heart again
Somehow I believe our love will grow
from the midnight hour to the morning glow
And I believe in you baby
Just one more night my love
break
Just one more night my love
And all that we believe become a lie
And loneliness will disappear with the tears we cried fadeIntrumental onlyWhen I was just a little boy when I didnt know
My daddy put me n his knee and showed me the way to go
He said a woman will do her best to make a fool out of you
So be a man and stand the test and see what you can do
Im glad I am born a man
Im glad I am born a man
If you got what it takes my boy
You can always choose
Work it out before its too late my boy
Make sure you never lose
Im glad I am born a man
Im glad I am born a man
Born a man
Every woman wants her man to live and learn on her land
Where I go baby you go
Arrangement man and wife
Im glad I am born a man
Im glad I am born a man
Born a manWhen I dont see you
And I dont know where youve been
There gets to be a question in my mind
It hurts to love you
And the knife goes through the heart of me
When youre gone I lose a part of me thats hard to find
Dont want to fall asleep without you
Dont wanna wake dont wanna wake up when youre gone
I dont know what you do that makes me love you
But then love dont mean surrender
And its time I let it show
Youve got someone else in love with you
And I deserve to know
Youve been laying our
Love on the line
Thats my suspicion
When I see her in your eyes
Love undermined
No ammunition
I dont wanna love you paralyzed
I dont wanna love you paralyzed
Some misty morning
When she does the same to you
When she makes you feel like I do
Thats the day
She cant have you
She cant build a wall around you
She cant love you like I love you
Anyway
I know by midnight if you leave me
No lies can make the difference
More hearts get broken now than need be
Its right to face the woman
That steal the away man
If theres anything to get you back
That I must do I can
And our love will never be
Love on the line
Thats my suspicion
When I can see her in your eyes
In your eyes
Love undermined
Im on a mission
I dont wanna love you paralyzed
I dont wanna love you paralyzed
My life I wont surrender
Ill find out where you go
Theres someone else in love with you
And I deserve to know
And its dying in the heart of me
And our love should never be
Love on the line
Thats my suspicion
When I can see her in your eyes
In your eyes
Love undermined
No ammunition
Dont wanna love you paralyzed
Love on the line
Thats my suspicion
When I can see her in your eyes
Love undermined
And Im on a mission
I dont wanna love you paralyzed
I dont wanna love you paralyzed
Love undermined
Thats my suspicion
When I can see her in your eyes
Love on the line
Thats my suspicion
When I can see her in your eyesHow can you decide whats better
From inside your heart
Better not to try
Its better not to start
Someone making love to you
It shows under the skin
Anyone can win
Someone like me can win
In it for the money
Whatever whatever
In for the love
That hungers me for the start of things
Someone elses body
All your loving brings
There must be something more
Something more
These walls have eyes
These walls have ears
They see the lies
That hide the fears
They watch us live
They watch us grow
What lies ahead
What lies below
When that magnificent woman
Lays back
Behind the beat
Better not to sleep
Someone making love to you
Perform that magical skill
Go in for the kill
You move in for the kill
Kill for the money
Whatever it takes
Kill for the love
Waiting until the hunger breaks
Someone elses body
Your destiny
And even all that is sacred
Is sacred is the secret is mine
These walls have eyes
These walls have ears
They see the lies
That hide the fears
Each babys cry
Each song is sung
These walls have heard
Each bell thats rung
If spiders crawl
These walls within
Theres room for all
When fate steps in
We celebrate
All things we crave
What life is lost
What love we save
One for the money
Oh the planet shakes whenever we burn
I want my love all over you
Its all the love was meant to be
We keep the secret with me
These walls have eyes
These walls have ears
They see the mask
That hides the years
One spark of joy
One voice to laugh
Those days foretold
In photograph
They watch us live
They watch us grow
What lies ahead
What lies below
These walls have eyes
These walls have ears
These walls have eyes
These walls have ears
They wont survive
For all the tearsOne road to happiness
One road to loneliness
The devils hand or the promised land
Which one will you choose
Life is a strange thing
It can make you happy or sad
Theres two roads that you can take
The good one or the bad
One road to happiness
One road to loneliness
The devils hand or the promised land
Which one will you choose
You may take the long road
Lots of people do
But you will find no peace of mind
Till jesus comes to you
One road to happiness
One road to loneliness
The devils hand or the promised land
Which one will you choose
If you take the bad road you will never see
The happiness that you would find through all eternity
One road to happiness
One road to loneliness
The devils hand or the promised land
Which one will you choose
One road to happiness
One road to loneliness
The devils hand or the promised land
Which one will you chooseVerse one
Angel eyes
High above suspicion
What you do
Nobody questions why
Set your watch
Another situation
And you believe
Shell run away with you
Release one
So wonderful for you
That makes you happy
How wonderful to see
That you can get to dream
So wonderful a dream
The pressure on you
To keep her in your heart
As mine is dying
Chorus
Do something for your love
If anybody wants you
Something for your love
Anybody wants you
Something for your love
Anybody wants you
Something for your love
Anybody wants you
Body moves
Changes her position
Into view
Let the people stare
She dont care
She got no competition
She plays that game
That only she can win
Release two
So wonderful for you
That makes it easy
Both fighting for your heart
As mine is dying
Chorus
Bridge
All of me
With all of you
You just got to do
ChorusLove is higher than a mountain
Love is thicker than water
You are this dreamers only dream
Heavens angel devils daughter
Say my mind should I go with her on silent nights
Shell drive me crazy in the end
And I should leave this paradise
But I cant leave her
while I need her more then she needs you
Thats what Im living for
Love is higher than a mountain
Love is thicker than water
You are this dreamers only dream
Heavens angel devils daughter
Say my thought should I find out she dont care at all
Shell leave me crying in the end
Wandering through the afterglow
But I cant leave her
While I need her more then she needs you
Thats what Im praying for
Love is higher than a mountain
Love is thicker than water
You are this dreamers only dream
Heavens angel devils daughter
Love is higher than a mountain
Love is thicker than water
You are this dreamers only dream
Heavens angel devils daughterHush my darling sleep my lover
Therell be rain till we run for cover
Lost in love in a world of strangers
Something only the lord arranges
Oh my darling now I found you
Want to live all my life around you
Youre my light in a world of sorrow
Scared of losing this dream tomorrow
I just want to hold you forever forever
Loving one another thats how it should be
Needing you beside me together no never
Try to rediscover no other but me
Oh my darling if you leave me
I lose the love that has always freed me
Not knowing angel whats coming after
Never hearing youre golden laughter
Oh my baby hearts like thunder
Cant escape from the spell Im under
I surrender to all your treasure
Endless nights of pain and pleasure
I just want to hold you forever forever
Loving one another thats how it should be
Needing you beside me together no never
Try to rediscover no other but me
break
I just want to hold you forever forever
Loving one another thats how it should be
Needing you beside me together no never
Try to rediscover no other but me
repeat last verse and fade out Its the way that she walks
Its the way that she moves
You can lose your mind
Makes you so wet
She can make you forget
Its a pantomime
Analyze fantasize
Anything your heart can tell you
Agony ecstasy
Ooh you got lucky
Do you love her
Do you love her
Does it burn so deep
That you just dont sleep
Do you love her
Do you love her
Ah no all right
Ooh you lucky
It can make you feel good
It can make you feel fine
Its a borderline
Its the way that she runs
All her fingers and thumbs
Up and down your spine
At a price paradise
Girl has got a lot to sell you
Hard lies paralyze
Ooh you got lucky
Do you love her
Do you love her
Does it burn so deep
That you just dont sleep
Do you love her
Do you love her
Oh no Alright
Ooh you got lucky
Oh babe does it bother you
When shes calling out my name in the night
Shes a part of me
And I wanna go
But I cant give in
Not without a fight
Agony ecstasy
Ooh you got love
Do you love her
Do you love her
Does it burn so deep
That you just cant sleep
Do you love her
Do you love her
Oh no all right
Ooh you got lucky
Oh no babe alright
Ooh you got lucky
Do you love her
Do you love her
Ooh you got lucky
Ooh baby alrightLittle boy with your smile so pretty now
What are you doing in my town
Little boy do you have a mother now
And are you planning on settling down
Do you know when your head grows grey
Will you feel the same as you did before
Cos when your old and grey
Youll still feel the way you do today
And nothings gonna change
Little boy now youre growing older
Youll need a shoulder to guide you through
And you find when you fall in love
You know youll cry just the way that I do
Dont you know theres a little girl to love
Thats what makes the world go round
But when youre old and grey
Youll still think the way you do today
And nothings gonna changeI fail to understand
Why you dont want my hand
I try to find whats on your mind
I wonder
Chorus
Why dont you stop and see
Why youre not loving me
Would it hurt to say Hello
Or dont you know
One minute women please
Id go down on my knees
To say to you with a word so true
I love you
ChorusAll the love of my mother I offer to you
And Ill try so very hard to get you through
If lay down my life for my King and country men
Would it change you for the better
It better be all right
To be always like children
Afraid of the night
If I gave up the cause what would you give me
to make up for all the things that I would lose
If I lay down my life for my King and country men
Would it change you for the better
It better be all right
To be always like children
Afraid of the night
Well you better get busy get it over and done
I was here when you arrived Ill be here when youre gone
If I give up my life for my King and country men
Would it change you for the better
It better be all right
To be never like people
Afraid of the night
Do do do etc fade outAll I need in my life
Just one love I can count on tonight
In the dark oh
Am I crazy to think we belong
Its possession
Oh baby possession
Possession
Baby what I wouldnt give for possession
Oh baby possession
Sweet obsession
Baby Id lay down my life
I cant fake masquerades
Your disguises just make me afraid
Yesterday oh
I was facing a future alone oh
Its possession
Oh baby possession
Possession
You know I would sell you my soul for possession
Oh baby possession
Sweet confession
You know I would lay down my life
Oh what Id do for possession
You know Id break every rule in the book
Ooh what Id do for an answer from you today
When Id pay any price for you
Twenty-four hours a day
Possession
Its crazy what people will do for possession
Oh baby possession
Sweet obsession
You know I would lay down my life for possession
Oh baby possession
Sweet confession
You know I would sell you my soul for possession
Oh baby possession
Sweet obsession

Sweet obsession
Oh baby possession
Sweet obsession
Driving my car we stop for awhile
Its getting so late and youre sending me wild
I know that its madness but ohh
Im scared oh so scared
Taking my hand try to settle down
We wont say a word till its over
And your eyes are so inviting I know that if we stay
Ill never take you home
You said you were seventeen but you are somewhere in between
That leads me on how old are you Oh
Ran away to open arms youre just a girl with womens charms
That leads me on how old are you Oh
You been busy lying youve made it up to now
Im caught up in the heat of the moment
If you love me and then leave me its the story of my life
And I wont be in the morning the man I am tonight
So little girl please try and understand
You mean more to me than a one-night stand
Im losing all resistance my head has lost control
Its wrong oh so wrong
Deep in the night shadows all around
Lost in the magic forever
And I know that when you touch me my heart wont let me down
Im scared oh so scared
You said you were seventeen but you are somewhere in between
That leads me on how old are you Oh
Ran away to open arms youre just a girl with womens charms
That leads me on how old are you Oh
Fighting all temptation Ive made it up to now
Im caught up in the heat of the moment
If you love me and then leave me its the story of my life
And I wont be in the morning the man I am tonight
You said you were seventeen but you are somewhere in between
That leads me on how old are you Oh
Ran away to open arms youre just a girl with womens charms
That leads me on how old are you Oh
Incomprehensible
That leads me on how old are you oh
You said you were seventeen but you are somewhere in between
That leads me on how old are you Oh
Ran away to open arms youre just a girl with womens charmsMany years ago I was a simple man
A simple man no worries me
I never lied
Please read me
Not much conversation ever came from me
I never saw reality
I never tried
Please read me
Maybe Ive been lying on your couch too long
Ill stay if you can see me through explain why
Please read me Please read me Please read meStormy nights Ive been waiting
Satisfy you oh yeah
But his love is just a game
And hes sellng you the same old lies
And Im hangin on the wire
And no closer to the fire
And you dont hear me when I cry
Chorus
You may need someone to lean upon
When hes gone when hes gone
And what is left is a love so strong
When hes gone when hes gone
You wouldnt believe to what extent
My mind is going to
You wouldnt deny me in your dreams
You couldnt belong to someone else
If you could see me now
And Id be the only one
When hes gone
My understanding that you remember
For whom the bell tolls oh yeah
I swear to you I pray
That you feel the battle rage
For the saving of my soul
And its a struggle to survive
You know its keepin us alive
And baby I dont wanna die
Chorus
I will be someone you lean upon
When hes gone when hes gone
And what is left is a love so strong
When hes gone when hes gone
I will be someone you lean upon
When hes gone when hes gone
Dont tell me its too late
And your love dont make me wait
I can see the end of time
With a love that makes you mine
And tonight I let you know
Theres a love that wont let goBaby oh no Ive been stuck here
Ive been searchin so long
Baby dont go millions of people were wrong
In the dark of the cold light of day
I will still be here
If my heart and my soul had their way
you would still be here
Another lonely night in New York
The city of dreams just keeps on getting me down
Cause my babys no longer around
And my feeling can never be found
Another lonely night in New York
And my sorry eyes are lookin out on the world
Baby you said a guy like me was way out of line
And knowing today your leavin was a question of time
In the mist of a sweet summer rain you will find me here
Should the sparkle of stars lose their way
Ill be holdin near
Another lonely night in New York
The city of dreams just keeps on getting me down
Cause my babys no longer around
And my feelings can never be found
Another lonely night in New York
And my sorry eyes are lookin out on the world
break
In the dark of the cold light of day
you will find me here
If my heart and my soul had their way
you would still be hereYou made a promise so did i
Youd never leave me alone
You wake me up in the middle of the night
Take what you what and youre gone
Tell me a reason for what I am
Ill never win this game you play
You wake me up in the middle of a dream
You make it over thats ok
It takes a million years for us to
Understand it all
All the love you need is why
It makes no difference now
There is no other you
Id rather die without you
Then let you go
My seasons in the sun
So many moments wasted
My love is living for you
And you should know
break
You make my world a better place
But I dont see you around round round
Could there be others Im replacing
No more love to be found
It takes a million years to make
You understand your heart
Let my love lay where it falls
It makes no difference now
There is no other you
Id rather die without you
Then let you go
My seasons in the sun
So many moments wasted
My love is living for you
And you should know
break
It makes no difference now
It makes no difference now
It makes no difference now
It makes no difference now
There is no other you
Id rather die without you
Then let you go
My seasons in the sun
So many moments wasted
My love is living for you
And you should know
repeat last verse and fade out A tint of blue deep down inside my heart each time I see you
It would take a lot to ease my pain from all these chains
A tint of red each time I see you with another
Just because I was your lover jealous I
I get so angry I could cry
A tint of blue why do you make me feel so sad
Why do you leave me feeling bad they way I do
A tint of blue
A tint of red each time I see you with another
Just because I was your lover jealous I
I get so angry I could cryI meant to fight it to the finish but you made me forget
And though its possible Im dreaming dont wake me yet
You know I love you I cant see the day for night
You know I twist around and turn around and then I give in
You end up in control of me its really a sin
I dont know what youre doing to me but I know its a crime
And baby I cant last another night
And every moment is eternity
And from the depth of my soul cant let another day go by
I follow my heart right up to the end as far as the eye can see
Im faithful and true and living up to your sacred trust in me
Ill never give out to somebody else I know where my arms should be
Im faithful and true and making it through your sacred trust in me
Your sacred trust in me
You take and you break me and do what you please
I stumble and I tremble and Im weak at the knees
The vision that lies before me is not reality
I tell you I cant wait another night
For every secret that your soul reveals
And you and I may get to know
That its real that its real
I follow my heart that leads me to you and all that my love should be
And you can be sure Im doing it for your sacred trust in me
Ill never give out to somebody else theres nowhere my heart should be
Im faithful and true and living up to your sacred trust in me
Your sacred trust in me
I follow my heart right up to the end as far as the eye can see
Im faithful and true and living up to your sacred trust in me
Ill never give out to somebody else I know where my arms should be
Im faithful and true and making it through your sacred trust in me
Your sacred trust
I follow my heart that leads me to you and all that my love should be
And you can be sure Im doing it for your sacred trust in me
Ill never give out to somebody else theres nowhere my heart should be
Im faithful and true and living up to your sacred trust in me
Your sacred trustI know that she loves you now
But your heart doesnt keep any vows
And thats a terrible way to treat your baby
A terrible way to hurt that girl
Its a terrible way you treat your baby
When you know that I love her
More than anything in this world
Her heart isnt for a game
So tell her you dont feel the same
For thats a terrible way to treat your baby
A terrible way you hurt that girl
Its a terrible way you treat your baby
When you know that I love her
More than anything in this world
Oh so sad leaving her behind
And if you give me the chance to take her hand
And try to change her mind
For its a terrible way to treat your baby
A terrible way you hurt that girl
Its a terrible way to treat your baby
When you know that I love her
More than anything in this world
For its a terrible way to treat your baby
A terrible way you hurt that girl
Its a terrible way to treat your baby
When you know that I love her
More than anything in this worldSee me loving you
A fool without a lover
How can that possibly be
Maybe you can show me why
I shiver when youre closer
I remember your touch without it
Let me drown in your ecstasy
Its got to be do or die
Dont tell me love is just one night
I know its not true
There should be someone there
To catch you when the rain falls
And you can turn away my Heaven
And maybe I was wrong
I depended on the inner voice of
Experience or just imagination
Whatever you believe in you can lose
And one way or the other
We can find another world we can run away to
Im living for the experience is only what you make it
You live forever but you never know that
Somebody loves you and when the sky is open
Fly away lovers can share Ill be there
And you can make the earth move
You can take me with no struggle
Lead me through your mystical dreams
Show me what you are
And we can make the wind blow
Youre the power and Im in it
You can be the fire I start
I want your heart
And let there be a story when the stories are told
I need to hear you say you love me when the night falls
We may never go to Heaven but one thing that is sure
You cannot ignore Ill make it more than
Experience is not an imagination
You get what you believe in if you choose
Somebody loves you I couldnt get no higher
Fly away lovers can share and well be there
Experience is not an imagination
You get what you believe in if you choose
And one way or the other we can find another world
We can run away to and I love you
Experience is only what you make it
You can come together when you let yourself go
And somebody loves you I couldnt get no higher
Fly away lovers can share and well be there
Experience is not an imagination
You can get what you believe in if you choose
And one way or the other we can find another world
We can run away to I I love you
Experience is only what you make itI know babys bad for my self-esteem
Find another face for your sympathy
Some of us cry some of them lie
but no one sees inside
The spark of babys eyes and I turn to stone
Maybe I cant survive in the danger zone
Sounds of the night
Streets without light
And babys not alone
Try to hold her to myself
Someone else is breaking all my dreams She
needs so many games to play
One more time I climb the stairs
Open up the door and she was gone
And baby here I go
like a lamb to slaughter
Dont stop haunting me in this old house like a lamb to slaughter
I still love you when youre not around
Im still waiting for your midnight ride like a lamb to slaughter
Ill still love you when its cold outside
Me so sorry that I let you down like a lamb to slaughter
But you keep haunting me in this old town
And the smile is no longer there
The face and the eyes and the hair
Nothing stands the test of time
You live forever never mine
I cling to dreams that turn to sand
Our life is now a distant land
We commit emotional suicide
Every single room is electrified
Your memory shadowing me
The house where sorrow hides
Pull it down blow it up
Help me send these walls of love away
And baby here I go
like a lamb to slaughter
Dont stop haunting me in this old house like a lamb to slaughter
I still love you when youre not around
Im still waiting for your midnight ride like a lamb to slaughter
Ill still love you when its cold outside
Me so sorry that I let you down like a lamb to slaughter
But you keep haunting me in this old town
Like a lamb to slaughter
Dont stop haunting me in this old house like a lamb to slaughter
I still love you when youre not aroundThere you are
Shiny as a morning star
Its a figure of speech
But youre still out of reach
You never told me loving you
Could be so wrong and right
And its gonna be a lonely night
I turn to you
You turn away
Youre looking at someone else
And here I am
Loving you more and more
We got an open door my love
Oh let it be just a state of mind
And suddenly you appear
Chorus
Im carried away
Im carried away
To be carried away
Im carried away
Cest la vie
So you wanna play another part
Can you say goodbye
Can you live a lie
Shell never give you what i
Gave you was my breaking heart
Better than I ever known
And if you can live without my love
You know youre gonna be alone
And here am i
Walking against the crowd
Calling your name out loud my love
Oh let it be just a state of mind
And suddenly you appear
Chorus
Im carried away
Im carried away
To be carried away
And Im carried away
Bridge
Baby there aint no final word
Ill be yours again
I got a world of tenderness
Yours until the end
Chorus
Im carried
Im carried
To be carried away
Im carried

One way or the other
Nobody wins without once giving in
So dont cry now dont cry now
Love is just a game you played in high school
Girls know how to be cruel
Most of the time girls are cruel to be kind
So dont cry now dont cry now
And we try to be cool as we dance in a crowded room
At the end of the day makin love to a paper moon
She said Boys do fall in love they make time
They get love on a Saturday night
And she said Hearts beat as they dance
In the street to a radio oh boys fall in love
Baby knows I like to be excited
No one wants to fight it
Its getting late so Ill just demonstrate
Dont cry now dont cry now
And we try to be cool as we dance in a crowded room
At the end of the day makin love to a paper moon
And she said Boys do fall in love they make love
They get love on a Saturday night
And she said Hearts beat as they dance
In the street to a radio oh
Oh boys do fall in love they make time

In the street to a radio oh boys fall in love
Boys boys oh boys boys boys
Oh boys boys boys
Oh boys boys boys boys

UnverifiedI was lost in your love
I was held by your heart
And no secrets stood between us anymore
Im like a child learning pain
I was held by your chains
And my darling I was lost in your love
Theres been a diffrence of opinion to the way Ive been treating you
But you know that Ive tried to apologize
for all the bad times Ive put you through
On the chance that I could make you mine
Theres not a thing I would not do
And wrong or right Ill be with you and lost in your love
I was lost in your love
I was held by your heart
And no secrets stood between us anymore
Im like a child learning pain
I was held by your chains
And my darling I was lost in your love
Now I will follow you where the wild bird flies
Through endless skies I will go
So I can be so near you girl and all of this you gotta know
That when I get you here inside my arms
I never ever ever will let you go
And wrong or right Ill be with you and lost in your loveGlass house that once was mine the sun will shine in on me
You change your mind you werent the kind to live on me
I remember yesterday turn my tears to laugher
Then you left and like a stray I came running after
I remember you at night palm trees softly swaying
I remember all the words you were softly saying
Glass house upon the hill so big and still the shady lane
Its ours my love until the day we say auf wiedersehenThe evening stars shine on me
The subway noises haunt silent street
The amber skies the shadowed walls
They lose their meaning when twilight falls
Im in heaven I cant go anywhere
I control two hearts on fire
Over and over
Cant you hear me calling
My love is alive
The silver streams of city lights
Reach out their arms to cut down the night
And so you see its not a dream
Ive got my woman to satisfy me
Im in heaven I cant go anywhere
I control two hearts on fire
Over and over
Cant you hear me calling
My love is alive
break
Im in heaven I cant go anywhere
I control two hearts on fire
Over and over
Cant you hear me calling
My love is aliveGreen fields where we used to wander
Purple valleys near my home
We would play there beneath the sky
And then I kissed you butterfly
Young girl you came restless
And you left me here to cry
My big teardrops in red pastures
For I loved you butterfly
Butterfly yeah
I dream about you lonely without you butterfly
Butterfly yeah
Each night Im sleeping your face goes creeping butterfly
Green fields where we used to wander
Purple valleys near my home
We would play there beneath the sky
And I kissed you butterflyJingle jangle my love wears silvery bangles
She likes to wander and thats why Im under
The spell of her jingle jangle
We used to cry on each others shoulder
Now that Im older she wanders ahead
Now that shes found love I still hear the sound of
Silvery bangles remain in my head
Jingle jangle my love wears silvery bangles
She used to wander and thats why Im under
The spell of her jingle jangleWhen I first saw you standing there you set my heart a-reeling
Baby you gave me such a feeling
My heart cries timber timber timber timber
Timber baby cause Im a a-fallin for you
Yeah yeah yeah
Well it happens every time I look in your eyes
Baby its paradise
My heart cries timber timber timber timber
Timber baby cause Im a-fallin for you

Timber baby cause Im a-fallin for you

Timber baby cause Im a-fallin for you
Whoa whoa whoa
Timber baby cause Im a-fallin for you
Whoa whoa whoa
Timber baby cause Im a-fallin for youGive me the honey wid the big butts on
Its time to stop the show
And show you how to flow right on
Its coming live like a flash
On the other side lift your hands and let me hear you dash
Bring up the sound and let it rise
Because this big fat jam will take you by surprise
Its just another rough move
From me to you and the posse from the EX-IT crew
So get your groove on and get a move on
And make it last to the way we slam this song
I rock a rhyme and let it last and show you mad styles
Because the flavours high and fly
Its time to show you how to flow
And move your big fat butt down on the dance floor
I hear the fever that youre bringing
Its just another song in your ear that Im singing
So let me show you how we swing it
Its time to make a stance and let the jam meet face to face
Just like I showed you in the past
I brake it right down wid a rhyme to make it last
Its just another funky jam taken from the Bee Gees
Set to make you jump and scan
I got the flavour and you know it come and check the sound
Because the big bands going down
So brake it down one and get this song on
I want to know are your feelings flowing strong
And if it is so I want to know Joe
Lets take it back to where the old school knows
Its just a rhythm and a rhyme makin it live
And coming back on a funky line
I hear the fever that youre bringing
Its just another song in your ear that Im singing
Now that the partys in affect all the ladies
Let me hear you say shake that thang
Now that youre standing on the set all the ladies
Let me hear you say shake that thang
Now that the partys in affect all the ladies
Let me hear you say shake that thang
Now that youre standing on the set all the ladies
Let me hear you say shake that thangI know how I feel
Lonely in the black of night
There can be no love for me now
Nobody listens when the words aint right
And you get into someone else
Its hard for me to know
Whos lovin who
And where do I stand
What did I do it all for
Theres no one I could love more
I did it for your heart alone
All that I try to be growin inside to me
I can be strong if youre there
And there is someone belonging to someone
And I got no one belonging to me
I live in a world where the face of an angel
Is all that a fool can see
You got the power to find me whenever Im lost
Where are you Who are we
I believe in time
Can eat away a heart of stone
And baby if I leave you too late
Its just a feather and the bird has flown
Its colder when the fire dies
With all the trouble Im in if I lose you too
Then what is my life
If I dont want to go through
Anything without you
Couldnt be life at all
I could be lyin on
You are the only one
We didnt make it by chance
And there is someone
Belonging to someone
And I got no one belonging to me
Im caught in a world on
The edge of tomorrow
Its all that a fool can find
I dont belong in the arms
Of a love that is lost
Nowhere to cry
There must be something we
Can say my love
Something except goodbye
And there is someone belonging to someone
And I got no one belonging to me
And there is someone belonging to someone
And I got no one belonging to meWell be lovers lovers lovers -- got to make you understand

repeat last verse and fade When morning time breaks
My lonely heart aches yeah
But no one I touch
Can tell me how much
A lonely heart takes
Cause the walls fell down
And the seas will drown
But nobody listens to my song
And the storm just broke
And the rain came down
But nobody listens to a clown
I look for your light
By day and by night
Im wasting my time
Just trying to find
Your face in my life
Cause the walls fell down
And the seas will drown
But nobody listens to my song
And the storm just broke
And the rain came down
But nobody listens to a clownNever more aware of what you do
I got you leaving me and missing you
And me believing that youve never done right
When youve never done wrong
You been coming to me late at night
Its not the eye alone that gives you sight
Ive never given anybody my soul
But Im coming undone
Im a survivor but Im reaching my low
But Im not ready to die
Im here for the kiss of life oh
Im here for the kiss of life oh
Just give me the kiss of life
Watch them hold you
Count their faces
A never-ending line
But theyre only
Imitations
Existing out of time
So now youre telling me its just a ring
You say its nothing but its everything
Im under pressure and Im under
Your gun and Im fingers and thumbs
You got the questions and the answers I know
Im being buried alive
Im here for the kiss of life oh
Im here for the kiss of life oh
Just give me the kiss of life
I cant stay here
Lost without you
Strangers in the dark
Holy angel
Living for you
To love and never cry
Im a survivor but Im reaching my low
But Im not ready to die

Chorus
Chorus
Im gonna believe in the LordI never fell in love so easily
Where the four winds blow I carry on
Id like to take you where my spirit flys
Through the empty skys
We go alone never before having flown
Faster than lightning is this heart of mine
In the face of time I carry on
Id like to take you where my rainbow ends
Be my lover friend
We go alone never before having flown
I am your hurricane
Your fire in the sun
How long must I live in the air
You are my paradise
My angel on the run
How long must I wait
Its the dawn of the feeling
That starts from the moment youre there
Youll never know what you have done for me
You broke all those rules I live upon
Id like to take you to my shangrila
Neither here or far away from home
Never before having flown
There Id like to take you where my spirit flys
Through the empty skys we go alone
Never before having flownIve seen the story
Ive read it over once or twice
I said that you say
A little bit of bad advice
Ive been in trouble
Happened to me all of my life
Ive lied and you lie
And who would get the sharpest knife
You know I couldnt be somebody like that
Im not the kind of man to throw his hat
Into the ring and
Go down without following through
The day turns into night
Go down following through
The day turns into night
Oh oh oh
This is just where I came in
Hope rides on
But Ill go anywhere
Yes Ill go anywhere with you
Time has gone
But Ill go anywhere
Yes Ill go anywhere with you
This is the danger zone
This is where I came in
They know not what they do
Forgive them all their sins
They know they cannot take away
What you have given me
Oh oh oh
This is just where I came in
Fade into color
Color into black and white
Under the bedclothes
Everything will be alright
I know that you know
Nothing ever stays the same
Said so I said so
The love will never speak its name
Never gonna find somebody like you
Beauty with a brain and a body too
I could never make a move on a woman that leads me on
Shes got a little bit of something for everyone
Its a little too late and the wolf is on the run
Hope rides on
But Ill go anywhere
Yes Ill go anywhere with you
Time has gone
But Ill go anywhere
Yes Ill go anywhere with you
I always told myself
I would regret this day
That I would fall apart
And watch you walk away
That you would cry out loud
And I would stand aside
Oh oh oh
This is just where I came in
I cant fly
But Ill go anywhere
Yes Ill go anywhere with you
This is the danger zone
This is where I came in
They know not what they do
Forgive them of their sins
They know they cannot take away
What you have given me
Oh oh oh
This is just where I came in
Oh oh ohI can make the sun shine out of the heavens
Sweet love love you forever
Just wait until the suns on your pillow
I can bring love cause thats all Ive got
I can bring love cause thats all Ive got
I can change the whole world if you are near me
No tears if you can hear me
Just wait until the suns on your pillow
I can bring love cause thats all Ive got
I can bring love cause thats all Ive got yeah
Ah
Just wait until the suns on your pillow
I can bring love cause thats all Ive got
I can bring love cause thats all Ive got
I can bring love cause thats all Ive gotOn a hill inside a house in Covewell Reach
Stands a man whos feeling very tired
Looking at a song he wrote some time ago
Could have made it big inside a Broadway show
Every day I go away and find ideas
Think Ill climb on top of somewhere high
Couldnt I write a song about a man whos dead
Didnt really know if he was off his head
Evrybody knows thats the way it goes
Too bad for Gilbert Green
We can tell the world that he was right
Sitting in his attic on a sunny day
Mending fifty goblets that are worn
Humming to himself a song of yesteryear
His hearing wasnt good but his eyes were clear
Evrybody knows thats the way it goes
Too bad for Gilbert Green
We can tell the world that he was right
Now the house is burnt along with Gilbert Green
Sad to see his sisters stand and cry
And in the basement lies a song that wasnt seen
Tells the tale of laughing men and yellow beans
Evrybody knows thats the way it goes
Too bad for Gilbert Green
Now we can tell the world that he was rightI saw you tonight
In the room where love had started once beforeAnd we opened up the skies
With your loving eyesYou take me back where you belong in my heart
One love frozen in time
Never be a bad love
Yours and mine
But I still remainI will never change
I will always love you
I will always take your part
And all the years of losing youAnd then being close to you againThe very chance that I could take your heart
Your hand in mine
You are inside of me
One more time
Dont you remember me
And the days that lie ahead
May all go wrong
But tonight my loveTheres no question in my mind where we should be
Its clear that youre alone and Im alone
And all the fools have goneYou open up so tears can fall from your eyes
True love can never die
We can make it one day - if we tryBe there - sunshine or rainI will never change
I will always love youI will always take your part
And all the years of losing you and thenMaking love to you againThe very chance that I could take your heart
Your hand in mine
I got a memory
For all time
Dont you remember me
Now my dream will come trueIf you love meDont let the day keep movin on with tears and pride
They hide the sun
Look to the road that lies ahead
Im turnin to the dream we left to die
Dyin alone cry for the moment you passed me by
Baby I dont now how Im only cryin now

Leaving me pain and sorrow
Losing you now

Dont look back dont analyze the tears you cry
Only the strong survive the silent sacrifice
And I I will be your heart of steel but power has a price
Aint it time that you believe in someone
Aint it wrong to let the years go by
Standing face to face forever live or die
Hold me like a child Im not alive until you do
What you hold in your hand is a miracle
And its dead if I dont have you
Hold me like a child and swear you never let me go
Youre the eye of the storm the reason I laugh or cry
Live or die I will stay with you
Take one breath one fundamental sign of life
No bad blood no pain can make you draw the knife
Ah We got a world of trouble but I will never change
And even if we fall tomorrow we will rise again
Now is the time we show each other these are the words I kept inside
Standing face to face forever live of die
Hold me like a child Im not alive until you do
What you hold in your hand is a miracle
And its dead if I dont have you
Hold me like a child and swear you never let me go
Youre the eye of the storm the reason I laugh or cry
Live or die I will stay with you
Live or die I will stay with you
Take one breath one fundamental sign of life
Dont look back we love each other live or die
Hold me like a child Im not alive until you do
Live or die I will stay with you

At the turn of the century
Im gonna buy myself a time machine
Go to the turn of the century
And all those people passing by
And the town crier makes his cry
At the turn of the century
Turn of the century
Big wide hats and men is spats
At the turn of the century
With those horseless carriages
At the turn of the century
And there are lots of things to do
On a bicycle built for two
At the turn of the century
Turn of the century
Everything happening
At the turn of the century
Im gonna buy myself a time machine
Go to the turn of the century
And all those people passing by
And the town crier makes his cry
At the turn of the century

Turn of the centuryBirdie told me I must get over you somehow
And she told me never to think of you right now
But its hopeless to say how can I forget the way she used to love me
I think about her in my time know in my mind its over
Looks like falling heaven is calling my name to me
Funny faces loving the traces left for me
But its hopeless to say how can I forget the way she used to love me
I think about her in my time know in my mind its over
Birdie told me I must get over you somehow
And she told me never to think of you right now
But its hopeless to say how can I forget the way she used to love me
I think about her in my time know in my mind its over
Birdie taught me how to get over youI dont believe in love
Im not afraid of the night
People who follow their hearts survive
Dont need the chains of life
I am no refugee
They say that the eyes of the soul surrender
Give me little lovin can we set the world alight
Evry thing I wanted walking right beside me baby
When I think Im losin I just look at you and
Baby I believe in miracles
Burnin through the night
Shinin with the power of lightning so exciting
Im on a journey I dont know if I can make it on my own
Baby I believe in miracles
Destination your desire
And baby oh sweet baby

The stranger that stands in the wind survives
Give me little lovin can we set the world ali	ght
Evry thing I wanted walking right beside me baby
When I think im losin I just look at you and
Baby I believe in miracles
Burnin through the night
Shinin with the power of lightning so exciting

Right in the prime of life
Heartaches and sadness
Lost in the madness
Cuts just like a knife
Dead or alive
I will fight to survive
And the night is still young
Cause I know tomorrow Ill be
Breaking in a brand new heart
But its hard when you are not around
Precious time to stop and start
And its hard the second time around
Questions and answers
What can the future bring
Take it or leave it
Better believe it
Love where is your sting
Paying the price
Of the pressure inside
And tonight I will run
Cause I know tomorrow Ill be
Breaking in a brand new heart
But its hard when you are not around
Precious time to stop and start
And its hard the second time around
Breaking in a brand new heart
But its hard when you are not around
Precious time to stop and start
And its hard the second time aroundYou get your pleasures out of hurting me honey
You get your kicks out of watching me cry
You play around an awful lot to hurt me honey
Why do you laugh when there are tears in my eyes
I dont think its funny honey
My days are not so sunny
Why dont you make up your mind
Let me put my arms around you
Make rainbows all around you
But I dont know if you are mine
If I was yours and you were mine my little honey
We could be happy till the very day I die
But all you ever want to do is hurt me honey
Why do you laugh when there are tears in my eyes
I dont think its funny honey
My days are not so sunny
Why dont you make up your mind
Let me put my arms around you
Make rainbows all around you
But I dont know if you are mine
I dont think its funny honey
My days are not so sunny
Why dont you make up your mind
Let me put my arms around you
Make rainbows all around you
But I dont know if you are mine
But I dont know if you are mine
But I dont know if you are minePeople in their pride believe its easier for them to leave
Their problems in the arms of others running to their mothers
Lasting love is such a funny thing
When youre in love youre on the wings
Youre not in love its good for you
cause you can do the things you want to do
Its you big chance to take it baby
Its you big chance youll make it baby
When youre high and mighty youll remember how I loved you
Youll be thinkin how you hurt me when I needed you beside me
In the night is such a lonely time
I dream of you and thats a sign
It means that I am still a fool
And I am still so much in love with you
Its your big chance so take it baby
Its your big chance dont fake it babyIve never been sorry for the way I was raise
The enemy fewer
And the love that I made was a symbol of the times
A celebration of the wine I made a memory in you
Ill still be the reader of the letters you write
Ill never be lonely for the rest of my life
Theres a corner in my heart we can never be apart
No we can never be apart
No tomorrow you be gone tomorrow

You mean the world to me
Someone else that we both call love
In your eyes

I was born to be with you on the day you were born
A beautiful angel with her face in the sun
She was searching for the moon
In every sparkle in the spoon you havent changed

In every corner of the world
If any smile becomes a tear
I will shelter you from the rain

I lose your love forever
But thats the darkest side of me
The games we love to play
I dont mind your lies
Are we friends or are we enemies
Tell me what the message is
Love is blind
Im not wearing any make-up now
Everything you see is real
God only knows we fall in love
God only knows we fall apart
Do we turn around and walk away
Never wise enough to know that it was beautiful
Telling me its beautiful
Telling me its beautiful
To think that I was sent to hurt you
You say that I went too far
You say that to stay forever
Then you tell me nevermore
I was always there
Before you turn to stone
There were lonely voices calling
Theres a night thats falling
And Ill make you feel the voodoo
What I do to you
And what you did to me
And bringing us together
But thats the darkest side of me
The games we love to play
I dont mind your lies
Are we friends or are we enemies
Tell me what the message is
Love is blind
Im not wearing any make-up
Everything you see is real
God only knows we fall in love
Do we turn around and walk away
Never wise enough to know that it was beautiful
Telling me its beautiful
Im not wearing any make-up
Everything you see is real
God only knows we fall in love
God only knows we fall apartIve been here all your life
Watching your crying game
You were the heaven in my lonely world
And he was your sun and your rain
I was losing you before I ever held you tight
Before you ever hold me in your arms
And I wont make you blue
And maybe an everlasting love will do
Ive got an everlasting love
So tall so wide so high
Above the rumble of thunder down below
Its your love I need
Its the only show
And its you on an everlasting dream
Can take us anywhere
Are the tears of yesterday
We killed the pain
We blew away the memories of the tears we cried
And an everlasting love will never die
Take me out of the cold give me what Ive waited for
If its the pleasure of taking my heart that you need
Then it only makes me love you more
I was yours before the stars were born
And you were mine
I could have saved you all the pain you knew
And I wont make you cry
And maybe an everlasting love can try
Ive got an everlasting love
So tall so wide so high
Above the rumble of thunder down below
Its your love I need
Its the only show
And its you on an everlasting dream
Can take us anywhere
Are the tears of yesterday
We killed the pain
We blew away the memories of the tears we cried
And an everlasting love will never diePassed the stage of sympathy
No longer living on the pain oh baby
Though I learned my lesson well
You got me with your magic spell
Im back in love again
I let you go for what you are
Should never be restrained
I simply set you free
You found me lost without you girl
And the love you say was missing
A love that brightens up the night
Youll never be short of the reasons
You can rely on all you need
Never be lost inside each other
And you know by the second time you fall
You were not in love at all not in love at all
Like the precious love that grows
You made my life on earth like I was
Never born before you I got the wings of love
To rise above the storm
But we were not in love
Sad to say were not in love
Not in love at all
How did you get to be a mine of information
Ill be the one that puts you wise
You know its not just that I want to dry
Any little tear you cry Im in love with you baby
Well never see all of the seasons
You can be my eternity
Never be lost
To cry myself to sleep in sorrow
Were not in love at all
Like the precious love that grows
And you and I will be
A story with no happy ending oh baby this I vow
The greatest love you will recall
That we were not in love
Sad to say were not in love
Not in love at all
Then why do I cry not in love at all
We are not in love at all
I just dont sleep at night
Not in love at all oh baby not in love at allMaybe theres a reason why we broke up
I could dedicate my life to something new
But I must have been asleep but then I woke up
Working out why I was still with you
All the things I wish I could have been
Wouldnt I be someone someone
And I would be respected
In the prime of my life Ill do evrything right
Ill begin
Wouldnt I be something something
I would get a reputation
In the prime of my life Ill do evrything right
Ill begin
Midnight stars are shining on my shoeshine
Telling me the things Im gonna be
Now the hurts all gone Ive pushed them all behind me
And the world is gonna fall in love with me
All the things I wish I could have been
Wouldnt I be someone someone
And I would be respected
In the prime of my life Ill do evrything right
Ill begin
Wouldnt I be something something
I would get a reputation
In the prime of my life Ill do evrything right
Ill beginIm dead my lifes been sold
All my years are cold
No trees to hide my head
All my roads are red
And in the Easter
I will see that same old sun that shone
And in the winter
I shall stand in seas of snow alone
I will wait for you yeah
Your eyes will shine like new yeah
I close my eyes and youre nowhere
And Ill wait for you for one million years
My face has long been wet
Ever since we met
We wed I knew shed stay
Then I passed away
And in the Easter
I will see that same old sun that shone
And in the winter
I shall stand in seas of snow alone
I will wait for you just like you want me to
I close my eyes and youre nowhere
And Ill wait for you for one million years
And Ill wait for you for one million yearsNot many days when the summer is gone
And the water is dry
The silence of war
You can never go home
You can not ever go home
So many lights in the heaven I saw
When the living were dead
And the mother instead
Keeps her little boy warm
Keeping her little boy warm
Fools never knowing
Never knew which storm was blowing
No one left to save the day
Only night last forever
All the truth dont change my weather
Let me live let me hide away
And all my world has torn apart
No glow of love no beating heart
There is danger on the earth tonight
And Im alone
When the hunter comes
When the hunter comes
Down from the cities and the valleys of woe
And the rivers of blood
And the army of souls
They will never grow old
Nor will they ever be cold
So many nights with the love in my arms
When lay down beside you
Who can tell when the moment is gone
Never be over and done
Fools never trying
Never knew which child was crying
Youre the reason for the rain
Its the road that you followed
Make it so theres no tomorrow
Only people are that insane
And all my love is nothing more
Than feelings that I had before
There are strangers on the earth tonight
And Im alone
When the hunter comes
When the hunter comes
When the hunter comes
break
Therell be no return
Should be die to learn
When the hunter comes
When the hunter comes
When the hunter comesWhere are you I love you Where are you I love you
Where are you to keep me warm
I had a dream of a place far away
I followed a river where the dead man would play
And Im leaving in the morning
And Im leaving in the morning
And I wont die so dont cry Ill be home
Those big black diamonds that lie there for me
By the tall white mountains which lie by the sea
And you a man whos as tall as the sky
Followed a river where thousands have died
He was leaving in the morning
He was leaving in the morning
If I come home and my women has flown
Those big black diamonds that lie there for me
By the tall white mountains which lie by the sea
Oh oh oh oh oh
Say goodbye to auld lang syne Repeat until fadeVerse one
Read my letter
And I pray you understand
Just you let her
Just let her force my hand
Release one
Be your judge and jury
Are we guilty of lies
When two worlds collide
Chorus
No one lover can last forever
So dont you sever the lifeline
Just two people who do whatever
Dont sever the lifeline
Your two faces
Which one do I know the best
Theres no story you can hide
That stands the test
Release two
Through the flame and the fury
Will tomorrow survive
When two worlds collide
When two worlds collide
Chorus
Break
Chorus twice and fadeYesterday was history who knows what there is gonna be when we meet again
Will you smile and tell the world about me
Can there be no doubt about me I was your friend
As I gaze upon a sea of smiling faces
Walk amongst the glow of moonlit places
The look in your eyes to see your smile
Wont bring you back to me
I remember things we planned
The world would never understand but we found a way
And the world of love you gave to me
Each moment is a memory whatever they say
As I gaze upon a sea of smiling faces
Walk amongst the glow of moonlit places
The look in your eye to see you smile
Wont bring you back to me
For the look in your eye to see your smile
Wont bring you back to me
Yesterday was history who knows what there is gonna be when me meet again
Will you smile and tell the world about me
Can there be no doubt about me I was your friend
As I gaze upon a sea of smiling faces
Walk amongst the glow of moonlit places
The look in your eye to see your smile
Wont bring you back to me
For the look in your eye to see your smile
Wont bring you back to me
For the look Repeat I tell my troubles to the coalman

Evry day and evry night without you

Make it evry day for you and I
Givin me the chance to go on believin
Girl you gotta go on believin

So much to say
Making all the words I save them all inside
Then I see you and they disappear
Like leaves beneath the snow
And life dont wait for everyone
And yesterday I let you go
Im watching you tonight
And I waited for so long
Ive been living on your memories
In a world where we were one
And you told me you could make it on your own
Im watching you tonight
And its making me cry
When I lost you I lost everything
But our love should never die
Not mine my love is born to be your love
Oh baby to make history near you
But the moment when I see me in your eyes
Youre gone youre gone
You can say goodbye if you want to
I love you but Ill try to understand
But in my soul I know its meant to be
Together you and me
But I know you came to fade away
Like voices in the wind
And I wonder if you feel my love
Its stronger than its ever been
Im watching you tonight
And theres no other one
All the love we gave eternally
Now its dying in the sun
Not mine my love was born to be your love
Oh baby to make history near you
But that moment when I see me in your eyes
Youre gone youre gone youre goneThere was a little girl I had planned to marry
This was my love I didnt want to share it
I thought that love would make my life bright and sunny
She said she couldnt love me cause I didnt have no money
So everyday I have to cry some
Everyday I have to cry some
Dry the water from my eyes some
Everyday I have to cry
I had me a girl and yes I really loved her
Every night well I was thinking of her
But you cant mix love with money
Cause if you do you gonna hurt somebody
So everyday I have to cry some
Everyday I have to cry some
Dry the water from my eyes some
Everyday I have to cry
Lord I know that Im just a poor man
But is it wrong to love cause Im not a rich man
But you cant mix love with money
Cause when you do you gonna hurt somebody
And everyday I have to cry some
Everyday I have to cry some
Dry the water from my eyes some
Everyday I have to cry
Everyday I have to cry some
Everyday I have to cry some
Dry the water from my eyes some
Everyday I have to cry
Everyday I have to
Let the water fall from my eyes
Everyday I have to
Let the water fall from my eyes
Everyday I have to cry some
Everyday I have to cry someFrom daybreak to sunset you are the heart of me
Saying what you dont really mean
Now I know where you go and all the plans you made
Playing for a love not a dream
All that I want is you now and somehow I let you down
Lost in my pain that where I lie
You got to stop think again before you give it to him
Stop baby one of us got to lose
You gotta stop think again before you lost the heaven
Stop baby one of us got to try
Oh its a great big world that we live in
Pleasure and pain thats where I lie
You got to stop think again before you give it to him
Stop baby one of us got to try
Midnight you leave me taking the part of me
That loves you like he loves you only more
Birds crymy sky falls
Darkness becomes my life he got you
I got nothing to be living forTake the short way home intro
Youve been makin up your mind
And I can save you from the trouble
That your heart is goin through
And I can tell you what your
Futures gonna be
Maybe we can open up your eyes
Baby you cant leave me now
There is lightning in the city
Stranger than you ever saw

Sweet voices calling wild echoing around this child
Sweet Faith Ill be joining you when my storys over
Dee doo doo doo dah dee doo doo
doo doo doo dee doo doo doo dee doo dah day
Small secrets in the wind blowing till the end begins
Oh my children stand by me till my storys over
Dee doo doo doo dah dee doo doo
doo doo doo dee doo doo doo dee doo dah day
If I were you and you were me those voices they would cease to be
They wont be free to torment me again
But in my bed again last night those voices spoke of wrong and right
They spoke of darkness and of light
They spoke of weakness and of might
The spoke of people in the snow
And distant places long ago
The spoke of fire and falling rain
Of health and wealth and death and pain
Nah
Sweet voices calling wild echoing around this child
Sweet Faith Ill be joining you when my storys over
If I were you and you were me those voices they would cease to be
They wont be free to torment me again
But in my bed again last night those voices spoke of wrong and right
They spoke of darkness and of light
They spoke of weakness and of might
They spoke of people in the snow
And distant places long ago
They spoke of fire and falling rain
Of health and wealth and death and pain
They spoke of people in the snow
And distant places long ago
They spoke of fire and falling rain
Of health and wealth and death and pain
La la Verse one
Sunday mornin its a quarter to five
You keep on talkin like your love is a prize
Bird in flight spreadin her wings
Sittin pretty in a city of sin
Release one
I dont mind adventure with a stranger
Trouble deep at the scene of the crime
Testify that Im not superstitious
Its tough enough to find out why you
Chorus
Radiate you bait your love with money
Celebrate a body to behold
Generate a state of wild emotion
Dont waste your money my love is not for sale
Funny faces in the shadows of night
Pain and pleasure is your only disguise
Radiate your fates on the fire
Stay awake love is a lie
Release two
In the street life is your creation
Trouble deep if you wake up on your own
Im a slave to sweet investigation
Its tough enough to find out why you
Chorus
Break
Chorus three times to fadeYou are the one all the songs that Im singing
You are my laughter and pain
So here I am on my knees and Im beg you
Dont let it happen again
You have said you found someone else
You let me stand in the rain
So here I am on my knees and I beg you
Dont let it happen again
Give me a chance to believe that believin
For once take away all the strife
For you are my life all the reasons for livin
So please let me live my own life
Give me a chance to prove that its true
break
So here I am on my knees and I beg you

So please let me live my own life
Give me a chance to prove that its true
You are the one all the songs that Im singing
You are my laughter and pain
So here I am on my knees and I beg you
Dont let it happen again
Dont let it happen againI dont need anybody I dont need anyone
Take it nice and easy mama take it on the run and I dont care
Id show my body anywhere
Aint no big city winners gonna pass my buck anywhere
Aint no four leaf clovers gonna settle my luck and I dont care
Go down to the courthouse and Ive been on display
Dont you think that I dont know
it aint been a perfect da but I dont care
Id sell my body anywhere
In the name of creation I cant find an explanation anywhere
Aint no easy rider gonna settle my luck and I dont care
Down down the road up the road
Down down the road up the road
Been rejuvenated to the highest degree
Aint no words describing what this feelings done to me and I dont care
Id show my feelings anywhere
Aint no heavy Mister Leathers gonna paddle my butt anywhere
Aint no four leaf clovers gonna settle my luck and I dont care
Down down the road up the road
Down down the road up the road
Down down the road up the road sing five timesWe are children of the world watching every day go by
Changes my life changes your life keeps us all anticipating
We are searchers of the truth every mans a boy deep down
Gotta say it how you mean it there aint no easy way
Like a bird in the wind like a tree in the storm
Like the breath of a child from the moment hes born
To the very last day when the curtains are drawn
We are children of the world asking every question why
From arrival to survival just to make it worth the waiting
We are faces in the night watching every day go by
Changes my life changes your life there ain t no easy way
In the back of your mind there is always a mark
Theres a wandering solo alone in the dark
You can keep it forever or tear it apart
We are children of the world watching every day go by
Changing my life changing your life keeps us all anticipating
We are children of the world watching every day go by
Like a bird in the wind like a tree in the storm
Like the breath of a child from the moment hes born
Till the very last day when the curtains are drawn
We are children of the world watching every day go by
Changes my life changes your life keeps us all anticipating
We are children of the world watching every day go by
Changes my life changes your life keeps us all anticipatingI should thank you for the flowers
Cant imagine how you came to think of those
That same colour rose for me
My world is made up of memories
You and I the laughter and tears
You never need to worry
I cant see anything
See anything but you
There could be so many others
But I cant see anything
See anything but you
I remember all the good things
When you held me for the first time
Things were right
On that rainy night for us
Love then now and forever
No time real and right where we are
As good as my eyes can be
I cant see anything
See anything but you
There could be some many others
But I cant see anything
See anything but you
No one ever cried
No one ever stood in the way
Evrybody lies
Evrybody buys what love is today
You can be a fool
In the beginning baby you were there
And when youre winning
What do you do
Dont ask me
I cant see anything
See anything but you
There could be so many others
But I cant see anything
See anything but you
There could be so many others but
repeat last verse and fade out Baby when I met you there was peace unknown
I set out to get you with a fine tooth comb
I was soft inside
There was something going on
You do something to me that I cant explain
Hold me closer and I feel no pain
And every beat of my heart
We got something going on
Tender love is blind
It requires a dedication
All this love we feel needs no conversation
We ride it together ah ha
From one love to another ah ha
Islands in the stream
That is what we are
No one in between
How can we be wrong
Sail away with me
To another world
And we rely on each other ah ha
From one lover to another ah ha
I cant live without you if the love was gone
Everything is nothing when you got no one
And you walk in the night
Slowly losing sight of the real thing
But that wont happen to us and we got no doubt
Too deep in love and we got no way out
And the message is clear
This could be the year for the real thing
No more will you cry
Baby I will hurt you never
We start and end as one
In love forever
We can ride it together ah ha
From love to another ah ha
Islands in the stream
That is what we are
No one in between
How can we be wrong
Sail away with me
To another world
And we rely on each other ah ha
From one lover to another ah haWhisper whisper
What have you got
I got something that you need a lot

Then it would please you if I should call
Doesnt matter what your name is
I can do a million things to you
No explanations sexual patience
Most of the nations doing it too
No no no no noJealousy jealousy
Two oclock in the morning I dont see my love around
You say you want to be with me girl
But youre never to be found
I know youre seeing someone else
And its sending me insane
Jealousy taking me over and over again
Jealousy saying you love but inside you pretend
You say I go on needlessly
Finding wrong in all I see
But I know in my heart from the start
You wanted to play yeah
You know Im so alive with you
Telling love with all you do
I know Im gonna drive your love away away
You were my inspiration
You were the answer to my prayer
A lover I could depend on and soften all my cares
I cant believe youre out at night holding someone new
Jealousy taking me over and over again
Jealousy saying you love but inside you pretend
You say I go on needlessly
Finding wrong in everything I see
But I knew in my heart from the start
That you wanted to play
But you know Im so alive with you
Telling love with all you do
I know Im gonna drive your love away away
Jealousy jealousy taking me over and over again
Jealousy saying you love but inside you pretend
You say I go on needlessly
Finding wrong in all I see
I know in my heart from the start
That you wanted to play
You know Im so alive with you
Telling love with all you do
I know Im gonna drive your love away
Jealousy jealousy taking me over and over again
Jealousy saying you love but inside you pretend
Jealousy taking me over and over again
Jealousy jealousy taking me over and over
Jealousy I cant help myself
Taking me over jealousy fadeWhen do I cry
This breakin heart

When were apart
And there are two of us
With our secret love
Sleep pretty baby while you wait so long
Livin with a love thats not just make believe
Lonely nights I see your candle glow
And in my mind I trace
Together we can take away
The time and the space
Baby when you got a secret love
Every little touch is not enough
Every little moment were apart is pain to me
Maybe we can find some hideaway
Everybody knows but who can say
Secretly you know Id follow
Anywhere to make it happen
Anyway you want me Ill be standing by
I dont want to lose the one I hunger for
Naked eyes they watch us everywhere
Nowhere to run I cry
Everything to lose and no alibi
Baby when you got a secret love
Nothin you can do but rise above
Secretly you know Id follow
Anywhere to make you happy
When do I cry
This breakin heart
Just hurts me more
When were apart
And there are two of us
With our secret love together we can take away the time and the space

Every little touch is not enough
Every little moment were apart is pain to me
Maybe we can find some hideaway

We got everything anybody needs
And its here with me with you
Baby Im satisfied makin my love to you
Makin my love makin my love
Cause you got me hypnotized
Before you took me by the hand girl
I was a statue in the sand girl

But that was just the way we were
Til you make a world of love in you
We got everything anybody needs
And its here with me with you
Baby Im satisfied making my love to you

Its a different look
Its a different time of day
One look in her eyes
How can I make you understand
Shes the one good thing thats happened in so many years
Theres been so many tears
When we lost the dream
And the winter came
And you said goodbye
And I dont want another reason to cry
You be all you wanna be
You got the longest night
Baby be alone
I share my dream with someone else
I dont wanna talk about her
This women - shes tearing my world apart
This women - dont know what shes doing
This women - touchs me and I lose control
Shes living inside my soul
This women - I dont even know her name
This women - dont know what shes doing
This women goes through me like a hurricane
Falling in love again
To make those long legs mine - is all I care about
Shes got so much to give - I got to be the one
I got to have
Someone to hold
I got to make it with that women
When the nights get hot
And she goes walking by
And the city lights - and the city lights
They make you blind
I go insane
But am I crazy if she feels the same
You believe what you believe
You got the darkest night
Baby be alone
I take my love to someone else
She was made to measure for me
You be all you wanna be
You got the longest night
Baby be alone
I share my dream with someone else
I dont wanna talk about her
This women - shes tearing my world apart
This women - dont know what shes doing
This women - touchs me and I lose control
Shes living inside my soul
This women - I dont even know her name
This women - dont know what shes doing
This women goes through me like a hurricane
Falling in love againDont forget me ida come back to me again
Dont forget me ida dont forget my eyes
They way they beg you ida beneath the starlit skies
Sweet as apple cider softer than a tear
You took away the green grass and left me waiting here
The morning rains come home again the hunter from the hills
Evrybody needs you home again
I guess they always will
Through the storm you wander
Through each covered glen
Please dont forget me ida come back to me again
Dont forget me ida dont forget my eyes
They way they beg you ida beneath the starlit skies
Sweet as apple cider softer than a tear
You took away the green grass and left me waiting here
The morning rains come home again the hunter from the hills
Evrybody needs you home again
I guess they always will
Through the storm you wander
Through each covered glen
Please dont forget me ida come back to me againInstrumentalI feel my heartbeat
When you run your fingers through my hair
Yeah I can feel you
I can feel you by my side when youre not there
Yeah Just as my life fades to darkness
You you make me see the light
Show me that my search is over
I pay the price I pay the price
Tell you someday baby you and I should be one one
Do it always brighter than the eye can see we hide the sun
The taste of love is sweeter like honey on the vine
Like the wind that feeds the fire two souls become entwined
Someday baby you and I should be one one
So Im standing round this corner
Tall enough to touch the New York sky oh yes
My love is so blind
I just cannot hear or see the world go by oh yes
Someone can love so completely
One kiss should break the sea
Truth can be stranger than fiction
This love is real
This love is real
Tell you someday baby you and I should be one one
Do it always brighter than the eye can see we hide the sun
Ah we are one we are one
I will follow
Count on me Ill never let you down oh yes
My devotion
If love is like an ocean Ill surely drown oh yes
Youll be my only possession
Ill be a slave to you
We hold the power together
Just me and you
Just me and you
Tell you someday baby you and I should be one one
Do it always brighter than the eye can see we hide the sun
Tell you someday baby you and I should be one one
You know my life is in your hands
And every breath you take is planned
And all this love goes on forever
Tell you someday Baby you and I should be one one
Do it always baby you and I should be one one
Do it someday baby you and I should be one one
Do it always baby you and I should be one one
Do it someday baby you and I should be one one
Do it always baby you and I should be one oneone thousand, nine hundred and seventy-four
I was hungry and I was cold had a father far too old
Couldnt make it to the place hed like to be
In a tree trunk in the park he was living in the dark
Keeping other dogs like him for company
In the evening Id go down to a nightclub in the town
Try to get some bread to make another way
Back to the park Id go dig him out of the snow
You know hes lived a thousand years day to day
Well the days get shorter and the nights get longer
And you never learn to know
If you love one another could you look at each other
Could it ever really show
And at this moment in time you couldnt make up your mind
Now could you ever understand
Are you following me just like Moses to the sea
Do you think Ill give you freedom in the end
When Im long dead and gone will your love for me go on
Will I be the one you run to in the end
And all my dogs need a friend
It was a quarter to three in the summer of seventy-three
When I heard somebody call outside my door
Said Are you friend or are you foe
He looked up and he said no but Id like to come inside and know you more
Well the days get shorter and the nights get longer
And you never learn to know
If you love one another could you look at each other
Could it ever really show
And at this moment in time you couldnt make up your mind
Now could you ever understand
Are you following me just like Moses to the sea
Do you think Ill give you freedom in the end
When Im long dead and gone will your love for me go on
Will I be the one you run to in the end
And all my dogs need a friend
Need a friend
Need a friendone
How can you say that we cant get along
Baby Ive never ever done you wrong
No matter what you might say
Im gonna have my own way
Chorus
You do your lovin with me
Our kind of loving just has to be
Our love must last our life through
Dont you go leaving me blue
What would I do
two
Each time I see the one you used to love
Is it my heart or hers your thinkin of
I want to be on your mind
Leaving this big world behind
Repeat chorus
Ah
I want to be on your mind
Leaving this big world behind
Repeat chorusI wandered into your wonderland
With eyes open wide
You turn me into your yesterday
But you will remain inside of me
Like I care for you
Oh I care for you
Run wild out on the edge of time child
Carry your dreams away love
No one can hold you now
For you are an island
I may be broken
But understand my love will get by
There will be others along the way my love
They will try to care for me
Like I care for you
Oh I care for you
Run wild out on the edge of time child
Carry your dreams away love
No one can hold you now
For you are an island
Run wild out on the edge of time child
Carry your dreams away love
No one can hold you now
For you are an island
Run wild out on the edge of time child
Carry your dreams away love
No one can hold you now
For you are an islandYou took a mystery and made me want it
You got a pedestal and put me on it
You made me love you out of feeling nothing
Something that you do
And I was there and not dancing with anyone
You took a little then you took me over
You set your mark on stealing my heart away
Crying trying anything for you
Im in the middle of a chain reaction
You give me all the after midnight action
I want to get you where I can let you make all that love to me
Im on a journey for the inspiration
To anywhere and there aint no salvation
I need you to get me nearer to you
So you can set me free
We talk about love love love
We talk about love
We talk about love love love
We talk about love
You make me tremble when your hand moves lower
You taste a little then you swallow slower
Nature has a way of yielding treasure
Pleasure made for you oh
You gotta plan your future is on the run
Shine a light for the whole world over
You never find your love if you hide away
Crying dying all you gotta do is
Get in the middle of a chain reaction
You get a medal when youre lost in action
I want to get your love all ready for the sweet sensation
Instant radiation
You let me hold you for the first explosion
We get a picture of our love in motion
My arms will cover my lips will smother you
With no more left to say
We talk about love love love
We talk about love
You let me hold you for the first explosion
My arms will cover youMaybe theres a reason why we broke up
I could dedicate my life to something new
But I must have been asleep but then I woke up
Working out why I was still with you
All the things I wish I could have been
Wouldnt I be someone someone
And I would be respected
In the prime of my life Ill do evrything right
Ill begin
Wouldnt I be something something
I would get a reputation
In the prime of my life Ill do evrything right
Ill begin
Midnight stars are shining on my shoeshine
Telling me the things Im gonna be
Now the hurts all gone Ive pushed them all behind me
And the world is gonna fall in love with me
All the things I wish I could have been
Wouldnt I be someone someone
And I would be respected
In the prime of my life Ill do evrything right
Ill begin
Wouldnt I be something something
I would get a reputation
In the prime of my life Ill do evrything right
Ill beginIn the history of humans I have found
No stranger to the strange
Its the dream of your choice
That fate could not change
Its a mystery that is the universe
Ten times the speed of sound
Dont be concerned I will take care of you
Take you from mercury to mars
Just state what you need
And jane will be there for you
Were on a journey to the stars
We never stop short of our destination
Eyeballing the constellation
I am your driver and Im proud to say
In a word your flight will be smooth
I am your driver its your lucky day
We be gone
Together we move 	together we move
Apart from black holes body rolls
Ready for the danger
Ill get you home again
We got a green light hang on tight
You can rearrange your bags in the aisle
The airline with a smile
We never stop short of our destination
Eyeballing the constellation
I am your driver and my speed is great
Im a stone born to be smooth
I am your driver I take you away
We be gone
Together we move how can we lose
All aboard the	merry widow I have found
Our ship can race the wind
Chase it and win for she was a pioneer
Like others before she lead the line
And theres been good times some were bad
Some were just appalling
Its all in the scheme of things I suppose
It all comes down to what is real or what your dream is
One show of shows
Just follow your nose
Youll never stop short of your destination
Eyeballing the constellation
I am your driver and Im proud to say
In a word your flight will be smooth
I am your driver its your lucky day
We be gone
Together we move together we moveI got your love on me baby leavin me was yesterday
Oh I got to be the one you wont ever see me running away

And the glow of you livin inside me
Got me knowin we can never die
Fallin in love with you baby

When I really should be sayin goodbye

Id like to catch her but that girl is too fast
I wonder just how long this can last
You got nothin to lose

You got me crying like I thought I would never be
Love is believing but you let me down
How can I love you when you aint around
And I
Get to the morning and you never call
Love should be everything or not at all
And it dont matter whatever you do
I made a life out of loving you
Only to find any dream that I follow is dying
Im crying in the rain
I could be searching my world for a love everlasting
Feeling no pain
when will we meet again
Why do you have to be a heartbreaker
is it a lesson that I never knew
Gotta get out of the spell that Im under
My love for you
Why do you have to be a heartbreaker
when I was being what you want me to be
Suddenly everything I ever wanted has passed me by
This world may end
not you and I
My love is stronger than the universe
My soul is crying for you
and that cannot be reversed
You made the rules and you could not see
you made a life out of hurting me
Out of my mind
I am held by the power of you love
Tell me when do we try
Or should we say goodbye
Why do you have to be a heartbreaker
when I was being what you want me to be
Suddenly everything I ever wanted has passed me by
Oh
Why do you have to be a heartbreaker
is it a lesson that I never knew
Suddenly everything I ever wanted
My love for you ooh
Why do you have to be a heartbreakerIf you never rode west of the arizona border
You can turn the other way boy but youll never get far
You be living a lie
If you wanna see the wonders of the age you must follow the evening star
Evening star
Shine a little heaven on the stranger with no dream
Where you are you can see the loneliness I mean
And if I gotta fight I will never play somebodys elses game
I can follow the evening star
Starlight - you never need somebody elses name
If you follow the evening star
Have you ever know a sunset when the skys on fire
How you end another day boy
You been seaching to far
Like the desert I rode on any memory is lost in the restless wind
I just lie beneath the evening star
Evening star
Shine a little heaven on a stranger with no dream
Where you are you can see the loneliness I mean
And if I gotta fight I will never play somebodys elses game
I can follow the evening star
Starlight - you never need somebodys elses name
If you follow the evening star
Have you ever held a woman in the california moonlight
Put your money on a good night
If you never been there its a sight for sore eyes
If you wanna see the wonders of the age
Making love beneath the evening star
Evening star
Shine a little heaven on a stranger with no dream
Where you are you can see the loneliness I mean
And if I gotta fight I will never play somebody elses game
I can follow the evening star
Starlight - you never need somebody elses name
If you follow the evening starShadows falling baby we stand alone
Out on the street anybody you meet got a heartache of their own
It oughta be illegal
Make it a crime to be lonely or sad
It oughta be illegal
You got a reason for living
You battle on with the love youre living on
You gotta be mine
We take it away
Its gotta be night and day
Just a matter of time
And we got nothing to be guilty of
Our love will climb any mountain
Near or far we are
And we never let it end
We are devotion
And we got nothing to be sorry for
Our love is one in a million
Eyes can see that we
Got a highway to the sky
I dont want to hear your goodbye
Oh
Aah
Pulses racing darling
How grand we are
Little by little we meet in the middle
Theres danger in the dark
It oughta be illegal
Make it a crime to be out in the cold
It oughta be illegal
You got a reason for living
You battle on with the love youre building on
You gotta be mine
We take it away
Its gotta be night and day
Just a matter of time
And we got nothing to be guilty of
Our love will climb and mountain
Near or far we are
And we never let it end
We are devotion
And we got nothing to be sorry for
Our love is one in a million
Eyes can see that we
Got a highway to the sky
I dont want to hear your goodbye
Dont want to hear your goodbye
I dont want to hear your
And we got nothing and we got nothing to be guilty of
Our love will climb and mountain
Near or far we are
And we never let it end
We are devotion
And we got nothing to be sorry for
Our love is one in a million
Eyes can see that we
Got a highway to the sky
Dont want to hear your goodbye
Dont want to hear your
And we got nothing to be guilty ofAnimal stalking you at night
Im a sucker for someone
And I got the prey in sight
Lying on a bed of leaves
In the modern times
You forget and let your spirit breathe
Capture me my blood is red
Another victim of your ritual
For you my skin is shed
Ecstasy aint what you find
In the modern world
One flick of my tongue changes
The meaning of the world
And you say thats impossible
Thats not impossible to do oh
And you digest what I can see
The taste of you can be
I dont wanna get eaten alive
Cause youre so dangerous
No more hearts I can trust
You see I dont wanna get eaten alive
To be eaten alive eaten alive
I dont ever wanna be eaten alive
Now I got you on the run
The quicker my senses
And the chance is Im the faster one
I know the universal law
Primeval times with a little stimulation
Itll come once more
And you say thats impossible
Its not impossible to do oh
And you digest what I can see
The taste of you can be
I dont wanna get eaten alive
Cause youre so dangerous
No more hearts I can trust
You see I dont wanna get eaten alive
To be eaten alive eaten alive
I dont ever wanna be eaten alive
I dont wanna get eaten alive
Cause youre so dangerous
No more hearts I can trust
You see I dont wanna get eaten alive
To be eaten alive
Tie me to a tree crawl all over me
You can rip my shirt drag me in the dirt
I will be your slave anything you say
I dont ever wanna be eaten alive
I dont wanna get eaten alive
Cos youre so dangerous
No more hearts I can trust
You see I dont wanna get eaten alive
Cos youre so dangerous
No more hearts I can trust
You see I dont wanna get eaten alive
Cos youre dangerous
No more hearts I can trust
You see I dont wanna get eaten alive
To be eaten alive
Gotta do her crawl all over me
You can rip my shirt drag me in the dirt
I will be your slave anything you say
I dont ever wanna be eaten aliveTell me whats going through your mind
Out of all the changes your making out you find
Hey baby that our love has gone away
I dont really want to leave ya but its hard for me to stay
Everytime I turn around youre changing me
Draining all of my energy
Trying t make me something that Ill never be
Honey set me free from this misery
Its tragic the things you feel inside
cause its killing me to know I dont keep you satisfied
cause its magic to think that love so sweet
You took my hand and made me feel life was so complete
Everytime I turn around youre changing me
Draining all of my energy
Trying to make me something that Ill never be
Honey set me free from this misery
When I met you
You seemed to be so satisfied with everything in life
You promised me that you would always love me
If I were to make you my one and only one
Now lately it seems youre always trying to change me
Trying to rearrange me
Trying to make me into something that Ill never be
Changin me and you know girl I just wanna be free
Rearranging me changing me you keep changing me
Draining all of my energy
Everytime I turn around youre changing me changing me
Trying to turn me into something that Ill never be
Honey changing me changing me want to change me girl
I just wanna be me I just wanna be free
You keep coming round trying to change me changing me
ad lib and fade out She says she loves me and you say you dont
And life has no meaning if you wont
Shes one in a million a million to one
And love makes us so much stronger
We hide the sun
Its undercover youll discover we have lived a lie
I never meant a thing to you
All I did was waste your time if it hurts dont let it
Someone loves you you will find the way
She says she loves me and you say you dont
And life has no meaning if you wont
The one road to Heaven is hell when shes gone
And love makes us so much stronger
We hide the sun
Its wrong to go on blaming someone you dont even know
One song was all she sang to me
All her words were soft and low if it hurts dont let it
Someone loves you you will find the wayEvrybodys doin it stompin australia way

You know I love getting up in the morning
When the sun first strikes the trees
All the morning birds are sing above
Still bring back memories
Of a girl who stood beside me
When the rights I did were wrong
But she went back down the river
Just when I thought I could be strong
When I thought I could be strong
IOIIIIIOIO
IOIIIIIOIO
She never told me why she left me
But the letter say goodbye
Now my mornings are for wondering
And my nights to reason why
Why the stranger comes to steal the love
Of a girl I had hold
But she went back down the river
Just when I thought I could be strong
When I thought I could be strong
So I singWe all need somebody
Some stranger in the dark
You know I really love to love you
I gave it everything I got
To find you in someone elses arms
But I was always dreaming of you
The kind of love you follow
Not without a reason
Every last tomorrow
Every single season
Hold me in your power
Drag me through the fire
Watch me writhe in agony
Make me bleed and all I need
Is someone to believe in
Someone to believe in
Someone to believe in
Someone to believe in
Why I need someone to believe in
Black night and thunder
Under your spell you see the man
With the urge to go home with you
One soul forever lost
In your far off distant land
No one watches you like I do
All of lifes emotions
All that love can give you
To convey the feeling
Someones got to love you right now
Hearts of fire
Burning in the night
Tell you thats what love is
But what I really mean is
All I need is someone to believe in
Someone to believe in
Someone to believe in
Someone to believe in
Someone to believe in
Someone to believe in
All I need all I need
Hold me in your power
Drag me through the fire
Watch me writhe in agony
Make me bleed and all I need is
Someone to believe inSomewhere somewhere it must be you somewhere
Ill come running to you somewhere
As fast as I can as fast as I can
As fast as I can as fast as I can
Somewhere somewhere somewhere in the night somewhere
Be my guiding light somewhere and Ill come to you
As fast as I can as fast as I can
I dont know just where you are
You be my guiding light
I know somewhere there must be you for me
Somewhere somewhere somewhere in the night somewhere
Be my guiding light somewhere and Ill come to you
As fast as I can as fast as I can
As fast as I can as fast as I can
As fast as I can as fast as I can fade outThis is my dedication
This is my dedication
Im not a saint but stand accused
Youre with someone who thinks loves the same as being used
And now suspicious minds may say its over over
Whether I live or die you are my savior
Youre my savior
Its my deja vu sweet deja vu
Through the feast or famine Ill be with you
Sheltering arms reach out to you
This is my dedication Repeat 
The silent nights I cry your name

Dont look back dont analyze the tears you cry
Only the strong survive the silent sacrifice
And I I will be your heart of steel but power has a price
Aint it time that you believe in someone
Aint it wrong to let the years go by
Standing face to face forever live or die
Hold me like a child Im not alive until you do
What you hold in your hand is a miracle
And its dead if I dont have you
Hold me like a child and swear you never let me go
Youre the eye of the storm the reason I laugh or cry
Live or die I will stay with you
Take one breath one fundamental sign of life
No bad blood no pain can make you draw the knife
Ah We got a world of trouble but I will never change
And even if we fall tomorrow we will rise again
Now is the time we show each other these are the words I kept inside
Standing face to face forever live of die
Hold me like a child Im not alive until you do
What you hold in your hand is a miracle
And its dead if I dont have you
Hold me like a child and swear you never let me go
Youre the eye of the storm the reason I laugh or cry
Live or die I will stay with you
Live or die I will stay with you
Take one breath one fundamental sign of life
Dont look back we love each other live or die
Hold me like a child Im not alive until you do
Live or die I will stay with you
Take one breath one fundamental sign of life
Dont look back we love each other live or die
Hold me like a child
Take one breath one fundamental sign of life
Dont look back we love each other live or die
Hold me like a child

Dont look back we love each other live or die
Hold me like a child
Take one breath one fundamental sign of life
Dont look back we love each other live or dieI was lost in your love
I was held by your heart
And no secrets stood between us anymore
Im like a child learning pain
I was held by your chains
And my darling I was lost in your love
Theres been a diffrence of opinion to the way Ive been treating you
But you know that Ive tried to apologize
for all the bad times Ive put you through
On the chance that I could make you mine
Theres not a thing I would not do
And wrong or right Ill be with you and lost in your love
I was lost in your love
I was held by your heart
And no secrets stood between us anymore
Im like a child learning pain
I was held by your chains
And my darling I was lost in your love
Now I will follow you where the wild bird flies
Through endless skies I will go
So I can be so near you girl and all of this you gotta know
That when I get you here inside my arms
I never ever ever will let you go
And wrong or right Ill be with you and lost in your lovewritten by mgibbkipner

Ooh I send you down my love tonight
On a dream that I can hold you near
Will the message in your eyes
Take shape and crystalize
Or will you disappear
That feeling when you sigh
I could not want you more
Ah so close and yet so far
And you know its where we are
And the moment I have waited for
The rhythm of the turning tide
And every start that shines in harmony
Like the fairy tale you read
Like the only heart you need
Is here inside of me
And we are held in time
Your love lost in mine
There is no yesterday
Just the music on the bay
We can lie together
Make forever
One night for lovers
Kiss your lover tonight
On a night like this you lie awake
And no one can tell you why
You fall in love and love takes over
With no goodbye
Im dancing in your arms
Tonight Id give my life for you
If you were
Mia no te voy hacer llorar
Dime lo que quieras me amor
Its the way it has to be
If I get you close to me
I will not let you go
Say youll be in my arms
Dont make me wait so long
Ah love me with your lips
Touch me with your touch
Fill me up with one anticipation
One night for lovers
Kiss your lover tonight
On a night like this you lie awake
And no one can tell you why
You fall in love and love takes over
And there is no goodbye
Im dancing in your arms
And Im close enough to know
You make me yours
And you
Youre mine
Youre mine
And the wonder of it all
When tomorrow comes I call you mine
Im the promise you fulfill
In a lifetime you will still be mineClose your eyes do what you wanna
Baby how can I wait much longer
Make it hard to believe it happened to me
Morning comes too late tomorrow
All you lose is the dream you borrow
All you got is a soul thats born to be free
and cries to the wind
Waiting for you
My dream will find you someday
I stand beside my vision of you
And have you loving me
I still love you
I still love you
Though youre my imagination
You be there when we find salvation
Only then will there be no reason to hide
Stormy night out in the heaven
I believe in the true forever
Theres a bright new star when somebody dies
I cry to the wind
Waiting for you
Sweet love returning someday
The day you learn love happened to you
You will be here with me
I still love you
I still love you
Ill be waiting for you
Sweet love returning someday
The day you learn love happened to you
You will be here with me
I still love you

That you dont love me where are you

You told me you told me
You would give my love the sack ah
Now as I fly you wont tell me goodbye
Cause you dont love me where are you

You own the love that somebody shares
You should be with me spending your time

Holding me only but now
Im just watching the hours go by
Nothing to do but cry
Now you are gone
I should be glad
But I love you only
So thats why Im sad
Go to your baby dont make him cry
Each time you kiss him remember I die
Walls are my neighbors shadows my friends
Keeping me watching me there
All of the things we shared
Im just watching the hours go by
Nothing to do but cry
Now you are gone
I should be glad
But I love you only
So thats why Im sad

Walls are my neighbors shadows my friends
Keeping me watching me there

Now Im watching the hours go by
Nothing to do but cry
Now you are gone
I should be glad
But I love you only
So thats why Im sad fadeFirst I rise then I fall
Seems like you dont want the love
Of this man at all
And its sure been a lonely time
Right up to the time I met you
So if you take a love like mine
Be tender with my love
You know how easy it is to hurt me
Fanny be tender with my love
Cause its all that Ive got
And my love wont desert me
So you say to yourself boy
Youre out of your brain
Do you think Im gonna stand here
All night in the rain
And its the start of a love affair
The moment when I first met you
And if you want Ill take you there
Be tender with my love
You know how easy it is to break it
Fanny be tender with my love
Cause its all that Ive got
And my love wont forsake me

Fanny be tender with my loveMaybe its been so long
Our house looks kind of different
But the empty rooms still mean the same to me
And as I wander through the darkness
Ill keep crying one last tear
Now your lips are gone
Ill kiss your memory
Chorus
Ill kiss your memory
As though you were here
Ill hold your memories till you reappear
And as I wander through the darkness
Ill keep crying one last tear
Now your lips are gone
Ill kiss your memory
Ill kiss the thoughts of leaves that fell when summer was over
And Ill cherish all the thoughts you gave to me
And I will wander through the darkness
Ill keep crying one last tear
Now your lips are gone
Ill kiss your memory
ChorusI know how I feel
Lonely in the black of night
There can be no love for me now
Nobody listens when the words aint right
And you get into someone else
Its hard for me to know
Whos lovin who
And where do I stand
What did I do it all for
Theres no one I could love more
I did it for your heart alone
All that I try to be growin inside to me
I can be strong if youre there
And there is someone belonging to someone
And I got no one belonging to me
I live in a world where the face of an angel
Is all that a fool can see
You got the power to find me whenever Im lost
Where are you Who are we
I believe in time
Can eat away a heart of stone
And baby if I leave you too late
Its just a feather and the bird has flown
Its colder when the fire dies
With all the trouble Im in if I lose you too
Then what is my life
If I dont want to go through
Anything without you
Couldnt be life at all
I could be lyin on
You are the only one
We didnt make it by chance
And there is someone
Belonging to someone
And I got no one belonging to me
Im caught in a world on
The edge of tomorrow
Its all that a fool can find
I dont belong in the arms
Of a love that is lost
Nowhere to cry
There must be something we
Can say my love
Something except goodbye
And there is someone belonging to someone
And I got no one belonging to me
And there is someone belonging to someone
And I got no one belonging to meIts over and done but the heartache lives on inside
And whos the one youre clinging to instead of me tonight
And where are you now now that I need you
Tears on my pillow wherever you go
Ill cry me a river that leads to your ocean
You never see me fall apart
In the words of a broken heart
Its just emotion thats taken me over
Tied up in sorrow lost in my soul
But if you dont come back
Come home to me darling
You know that therell be nobody left in this world to hold me tight
Nobody left in this world to kiss goodnight
Goodnight
Goodnight
Im there at your side Im part of all the things you are
And youve got a part of someone else
Youve got to find your shining star
And where are you now now that I need you
Tears on my pillow wherever you go
Ill cry me a river that leads to your ocean
You never see me fall apart
In the words of a broken heart
Its just emotion thats taken me over
Tied up in sorrow lost in my soul
But if you dont come back
Come home to me darling
You know that therell be nobody left in this world to hold me tight
Nobody left in this world to kiss goodnight

Lord bless all lord let all be blessed
And when you sleep london streets are silent
All the world is full of song
And when you have woken after dawn has broken
Snow filled fens will vaguely fill your eyes
Youll be guided by good will
Now the bells in your town are ringing
Far away the joy of carols singing
Bringing all a song to share
Lord bless all lord let all be blessed
And when you sleep london streets are silent
break
AhWe can talk it over
You are alone like me
I could feel when you arrived

Of your devotion
Dont take the lies that you heard
They dont mean a word

Just like before
You are my love

Born to be in all you do
You are my destiny all of me

I said that you say
A little bit of bad advice
Ive been in trouble
Happened to me all of my life
Ive lied and you lie
And who would get the sharpest knife
You know I couldnt be somebody like that
Im not the kind of man to throw his hat
Into the ring and
Go down without following through
The day turns into night
Go down following through
The day turns into night
Oh oh oh
This is just where I came in
Hope rides on
But Ill go anywhere
Yes Ill go anywhere with you
Time has gone
But Ill go anywhere
Yes Ill go anywhere with you
This is the danger zone
This is where I came in
They know not what they do
Forgive them all their sins
They know they cannot take away
What you have given me
Oh oh oh
This is just where I came in
Fade into color
Color into black and white
Under the bedclothes
Everything will be alright
I know that you know
Nothing ever stays the same
Said so I said so
The love will never speak its name
Never gonna find somebody like you
Beauty with a brain and a body too
I could never make a move on a woman that leads me on
Shes got a little bit of something for everyone
Its a little too late and the wolf is on the run
Hope rides on
But Ill go anywhere
Yes Ill go anywhere with you
Time has gone
But Ill go anywhere
Yes Ill go anywhere with you
I always told myself
I would regret this day
That I would fall apart
And watch you walk away
That you would cry out loud
And I would stand aside
Oh oh oh
This is just where I came in
I cant fly
But Ill go anywhere
Yes Ill go anywhere with you
This is the danger zone
This is where I came in
They know not what they do
Forgive them of their sins
They know they cannot take away
What you have given me
Oh oh oh
This is just where I came in
Oh oh ohSee the cracks upon the wall
We do not know the meaning of it all
Aint no fire to warm my feet

Whilst sir fredrick harold robinson casually retires
Another day tomorrow cries alan crayon steel
All must be up early to have the morning meal
The maid comes with decanter and to the butler there
Said sir heres what you ordered
He said no one seems to care
It must be good to live in the house of lords
It must be good to live in the house of lords
The house is now in darkness before the coming day
But at five oclock that morning the master passed away
The housemaid drew the curtains and the doctors watched the dawn
And the brother bendix sadly watched the gardener mow the lawn
It must be sad to live in the house of lords
It must be sad to live in the house of lords
Grandma mildred marshall was pouring out the tea
When she heard about the news of sir fredericks tragedy
The hall is now in sadness and everybody cried
On the banks of burntley river is where sir frederick lies
It must be sad to live in the house of lords
It must be sad to live in the house of lordsNow you dont know what you have done
You made me what I thought I could never be
Out of the flames with my hands untied
No time to grieve for the loss
Hearts that come together for the first time
Sparks that fly around the room
Lets face it Im dealing with something I dont understand
But Ill kill you if you stop too soon
To tight to fight the system of love
You get to try what others only dream of
Right to the body you get what you want
Just once over my love I make your knees bend
Its the fire of faith heart of the soul
I can be your system if you lose control Ill plug into you
I know how to love you girl let me try
Come together we electrify
System of love system of love

Now you dont know what it is
Since you touched me my world has changed
Youre the one that I live and breathe for
You and me baby gone insane
Loving arms that gotta hold on to someone
I can see you watching me is that what you want
State to state a matter of time
That you may be slipping but youre too too too
To tight to fight the system of love
You get to try what others only dream of
Right to the body you get what you want
Just once over my love Ill make your nose bleed
And its all for the love heart of the light

Like a razor
Ive been livin on the edge
Am I losing control
Ive been pushed above
The point of no return
Under pressure I fell
Release one
My will is bending
Like steel
This talk of danger
Is real
Chorus
Its not my nature
To be sweet anymore
Its just the nature
Of the beast at your door
Its human nature
In the animal world
its human nature
its human nature
I am not responsible
For things I cant explain
You know the night is like a zoo
In the jungle
With your back against the wall
Your love is precious to you
Release two
The fever burnin through me
You free the spirit in me
Chorus
Break
Chorus repeat three times Maybe I dont want to know the reason why
But lately you dont talk to me
Darling I cant see me in your eyes
I hold you near but youre so far away
And its losing you I cant believe
To watch you leave and let this feeling die
You alone are the living thing that keeps me alive
And tomorrow if Im here without your love
You know I cant survive
Only my love can raise you high above it all
Dont throw it all away our love our love
Dont throw it all away our love
Dont throw it all away our love our love
Dont throw it all away our love
We can take the darkness and make if full of light
But let your love flow back to me
How can you leave and let this feeling die
This happy room will be a lonely place when you are gone
And I wont even have your shoulders for the crying on
No other womens love could be as true Im begging you
Dont throw it all away our love our love
Dont throw it all away our love
Dont throw it all away our love our love
Dont throw it all away our love
We changed the world we made it ours to hold
But dreams are made for those who really try
This losing you is real
But I still feel you here inside
Dont throw it all away our love our love
Dont throw it all away our love
Dont throw it all away our love our love
Dont throw it all away our love
Dont throw it all away our love our love
Dont throw it all away our love
Dont throw it all away our love our love
Dont throw it all away our love
Dont throw it all away our love our love
Dont throw it all away our love
Dont throw it all away our love our love
Dont throw it all away our loveI have been lying under a pillow of dreams
And feeling moments of swimming in cream
This is the start of the end goodbye
Hours of facing my life have damned
You are a good friend
Friendly as good friends can be
Your father wants you to live on his knee
This is the start of the end climb by me
Red sides and blue sides within remind me
I have been lying under a pillow of dreams
And feeling moments of swimming in cream
This is the start of the end goodbye
Hours of facing my life have damnedThere she was
She dragged my heart around
No desire to hurt you girl
I gave it all before I found
The damage had been done
Burning love I was too weak to fight
Searching fingers in the night
I should have been a stronger man
But I was overcome
Someone can steal your dream
You know love is blind
I cant lose you now
Or I lose my mind
Hold me like you know
Stay inside my soul
Its my love
And your love goes to show
Thats right thats right
You blame it on temptation
It happens all the time
Thats right thats right
You blame it on temptation
It happens all the time
I was wrong
So wrong to make you cry
All your friends may tell you why
You and I should say goodbye
The way that people do
Jealous words
Dont let them kill the flame
I wont let you forget my name
And no one feels the same way
That I feel for you
Live for you all my life
Live your night and day
With you on my side
I cant lose my way
Ill be a shoulder for you
Be a man of steel
Womens gone
That was just a dream
And you are real
Thats right thats right
You blame it on temptation
It happens all the time
Thats right thats right
Only you can save me
Save me from temptation eyes
Live for you all my life
Live your night and day
With you on my side
I cant lose my way
Ill be a shoulder for you
Ill be your man of steel
That womens gone
She was just a dream
And you are real
Thats right thats right
You blame it on temptation
It happens all the time
Thats right thats right
Only you can save meBaby I cant figure it out
Your kisses taste like honey
Sweet lies dont gimme no rise
Oh oh what youre trying to do
Livin on your cheatin
And the pain grows inside me
Its enough to leave me crying in the rain
Love you forever but youre
Driving me insane
And Im hanging on
Oh oh Ill win Ill never give in
Our love has got the power
Too many lovers in one lifetime
Aint good for you
You treat me like a vision in the night
Someone there to stand behind you
When your world aint working right
I aint no vision I am the man
Who loves you inside out
Backwards and forwards with
My heart hanging out
I love no other way
What am I gonna do if we lose that fire
Wrap myself up and take me home again
Too many heartaches in one
Lifetime aint good for me
I figure its the love that keeps you warm
Let this moment be forever
We wont ever feel the storm
I aint no vision I am the man
Who loves you inside out
Backwards and forwards with
My heart hanging out
I love no other way
What am I gonna do if we lose that fire
Dont try to tell me its all over
I cant hear a word I cant hear a line
No man could love you more
And thats what Im cryin for
You cant change the way I feel inside
Youre the reason for my laughter and my sorrow
Blow out the candle I will burn again tomorrow
No man on earth can stand
Between my love and I
And no matter how you hurt me
I will love you till I die
I aint no vision I am the man
Who loves you inside out
Backwards and forwards with
My heart hanging out
I love no other way
What am I gonna do if we lose that fire
Loves you inside out
Backwards and forwards with
My heart hanging out
I love no other way
What am I gonna do if we lose that fire
Loves you inside out
Backwards and forwards with
My heart hanging out
I love no other way
What am I gonna do if we lose that fireI am the searcher of my fortunes
Ive got my right hand on the wheel
Weve got to dig for buried treasures
I know exactly how I feel
I went walkin through a graveyard
Where the darkness is my friend
I heard all about the beginning
I want to see just where it ends
I have fed the jaded tiger
And every tiger knows my name
But just as long as long as I can see my face
I can tell myself my name
Dont want to live inside myself
Im much better of alone
But then you must believe in the fallin rain
In the morning
Bury me down by the river
Saved by the bell
Man for all seasonsGeorge was born somewhere inside London town
Working as he grew for that extra pound
Respected by all he married and made a home
To give his children more then he had known
But then he died with out an explanation
He never lied a very sincere relation
Years before a fire sent him in the street
It took him months of work to make ends meet
But then he died without and explanation
He never lied a very sincere relation I rolled into the smoke and there I lost my hope
I need someone to know me and to show me
The square peg fits the hole
Why havent I been told
I need someone to know me and to show me
Trafalgar Trafalgar Trafalgar please dont let me down
Ten hundred people roam through the place I call me home
I need someone to know me and to show me
Sitting cross-legged on my own and yet Im not alone
Dont need no one to show me
No one owns me
Trafalgar Trafalgar Trafalgar
Trafalgar Trafalgar Trafalgar please dont let me down
Trafalgar Repeat I aint got no claim to nothing
I dont mess with anyone
I walk my way
Living in a masquerade
And one day I looked behind me
At all the things Ive done
Thats the first mistake
I ever made
I was born to a lonely woman
In a town called Buffalo
Never knew the man
Who never stayed
With my twelve-string on my back
I discovered every track
Thats the first mistake
I ever made
With a million hearts Ive broken
I never kept the score
Memories of good love
Hate to stay
But I still remember someone
Who loved me so much more
Thats the first mistake
I ever made
So when nothings worth the living
And in the night I look above
Prayed about a million times
I prayed
I know my story ended
When I lost my only love
Thats the first mistake
I ever made
I was born to a lonely woman
In a town called Buffalo
Never knew the man
Who never stayed
With my twelve-string on my back
I discovered every track
Thats the first mistake
I ever madeBefore I heard your voice
I never heard a sound like that before
I want to hear it more and more
Take me to heaven
My love is stronger than the wall
Ill climb it till I fall
So I can hear you call
Your love
Id be the greatest man in the world
cause I can say I got the greatest girl
Id be the greatest man in the world
cause I can say I got the greatest girl
Before I saw your face
I never saw a dream like that before
I want to see it more and more
Take me to heaven
My love is stronger than the wall
Ill climb it till I fall
So I can hear you call
Your love
Be the greatest man in the world
cause I can say Ive got the greatest girl
Be the greatest man in the world
cause I can say I got the greatest girl
The greatest girl
Be the greatest man in the world
Oh Be the greatest man in the world
Be the greatest man the greatest man in the world
The greatest man be the greatest man in the worldI never really want to be alone
I had a woman once in my life and but now shes flown
Every night I keep seeing her face
I never really broke her heart She was a part of me
But thats the way it was now we live separately
When will you walk through this door babe
When you left I fell to pieces
But now I feel as good as if I were dead
Ill keep remembering all my life
Remembering when you were my wife
Remembering all my life
And Im facing a life that I must go through remembering
I first set my eyes on you one cold February
You made me go out of my way to make me feel fine
Oh but when will you walk through this door babe
When you left I fell to pieces
Now I feel as good as good as if I were deadI can think of younger days
When living for my life
Was everything a man could want to do
I could never see tomorrow
But I was never told about the sorrow
How can you mend a broken heart
How can you stop the rain from falling down
How can you stop the sun from shining
What makes the world go round
How can you mend this broken man
How can a loser ever win
Please help me mend my broken heart
And let me live again
I can still feel the breeze
That rustles through the trees
And misty memories of days gone by
We could never see tomorrow
But no one said a word about the sorrow
How can you mend a broken heart
How can you stop the rain from falling down
How can you stop the sun from shining
What makes the world go round
And how can you mend this broken man
How can a loser ever win
Please help me mend my broken heart
And let me live again
La la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la
Please help me mend my broken heart
And let me live again

People laugh and people cry
Every morning the clock strikes eight
I go to work
I close the gate
And on my way I sing a song
About my wife where I belong
If the clouds get together and talk about the weather
If its rain they anticipate
Baby make no mistake
Yes the storm will break but never me you see
Two years on two years on
But only you can see me
Only you can see me
For what Ive got
Sir Lancelot was just a dream and I am not
For I am he with something more
Its you and I reality
If the cloud get together and talk about the weather
If its rain they anticipate
Baby make no mistake
Yes the storm will break but never me you see
Two years on two years on
But only you can see me
Only you can see meTell me if dreams do come true
If so then I know that Im losing you
And you know the address where we live
But I swear therell be no turning back to you
I wont forgive
When do I and when do I
Know if theres an answer why
I wonder if I know where I fit in
How do I and how do I
Stop myself from gonna cry
I wonder if I know where I fit in
Tell me if dreams do come true
If so then I know that Im losing you
And you know the address where we live
But I swear therell be no turning back to you

When do I and when do I
Know if theres an answer why
I wonder if I know where I fit in
And how do I and how do I
Stop myself from gonna cry

And when do I and when do I

Tell me why tell me why tell me why
And if you think that you can hurt me with lies that cry
Tell me why tell me why tell me why
Now Ive got my reasons for feeling this way
Day after day and as nights go by
So if you think my heart is broken and I might die
Tell me why tell me why tell me why
All of the world is as lonely as me
Day after day and as nights go by
So if you think my heart is broken and I might die
Tell me why tell me why tell me why
Tell me why tell me why tell me whyleaving thats all you ever seem to say and Im tired
The wants you have me for have expired
Sleeping and reading every book I can find to get my mind off
In all I was a soul you were using
I am alone again
You cant believe the tears that Ive shed
Im on a bound down train
Dont desert me now or I am dead
People the sun is going down on your heads so read your paper
Theres no one there for you to confide in
Its instinct to always to have a shoulder to cry on
And to rely on
Someone there to share and to shine on
I am alone again
You cant believe the tears that Ive shed
Im on a bound down train
Dont desert me now or I am dead
Repeat 
I am alone again
You cant believe the tears that Ive shed
Im on a bound down train
Dont desert me down or I am deadSummers come and summers go
But I still need the rain
All your vines will overgrow
And winds will blow insane
But Im not goin to move
And I wont make you cry
You can shelter in my home
And I wont ask you why
Friends will come and friends will go
But you stay on my train
All your wines will overflow
As winds will blow insane
But Im not goin to move
And I wont make you cry
You can shelter in my home
And I wont ask you why
You can shelter in my home
And I wont ask you whyWhen I was ten years old my parents were poor
Our house was so cold
And I was still in school and learning
And then I never really got too far
And everyone we knew had money
And driving a car and driving a car
Now Im twenty-one
The street where I lived is blown up and gone
And Ive had a good day crying
And the world around has changed a lot
I never really gave much more
Much more then I got much more then I gotYouve had your troubles Israel

Would you leave the door open let me walk in again
Thats the way I been thinking bout tomorrow
I only know that friends cant be lovers againI wish there was another year another time
When people sang and poems rhymed
My name could be Napoleon
A thousand ships
A windy sail so huge and high
Its tall enough to touch the sky
Its beautiful but hard to find
But I just wasnt born in time
Walking back to Waterloo again
Where do I begin
In the brand new street
You can get a good seat at the end
I can dream
Of growing trees and things that live
And grass thats green
In meadows that have never been
But I still place my trust in the Queen
What is life
When a man is pressured
Based on wrong or right
And I dont know what it means
There must be more we havent seen
Walking back to Waterloo again
Where do I begin
In the brand new street
You can get a good seat at the end
Walking back to Waterloo again
Where do I begin
In the brand new street
You can get a good seat at the end
Walking back to Waterloo again
Where do I begin
In the brand new street
You can get a good seat at the endDont you drink with me cause you know that Im a loser
And Im proud of that fact as you can plainly see
Never did what people said I shouldve
Im just a low down critter who never did any good
Im just a low down critter who never did any good
I spend my life working up a sweat to be a bad boy
Getting girls into trouble every day
Going from town to town
Now I tell you Ive been around
Im just a low down critter who never did any good
Im just a low down critter who never did any good
Lay it on me yeah
Dont you drink with me cause I tell you that Im a loser
And Im proud of that fact as you can plainly see
Going from town to town Now I tell you Ive been around
Im just a low down critter who never did any good
Im just a low down critter who never did any goodI arise try to see my face through my disguise
And on the balcony I knew inside of me it will be done
Somebody stop the music
Somebody stop the tune
Somebody crown the clown with the red balloon
Somebody stop the music
Somebody stop the tune
Somebody crown the clown with the red balloon
I arose the truth will out the more it grows
Its not a mystery no one was hiding it from me
Somebody stop the music
Somebody stop the tune
Somebody crown the clown with the red balloon
Somebody stop the music
Somebody stop the tune
Somebody crown the clown with the red balloon
Dont love ya baby dont love ya Repeat 
Yeah today I saw the sun the sunGood morning mister sunshine you brighten up my day
Come sit beside me in your way
I see you every morning outside the restaurants
The music plays so nonchalant
Lonely days lonely nights
Where would I be without my woman
Lonely days lonely nights
Where would I be without my woman
Lonely days lonely nights
Where would I be without my woman
Lonely days lonely nights
Where would I be without my woman
Lonely days lonely nights
Where would I be without my woman
Good morning mister sunshine you brighten up my day
Come sit beside me in your way
Lonely days lonely nights
Where would I be without my woman
Lonely days lonely nights
Where would I be without my woman
Lonely days lonely nights
Where would I be without my woman
Lonely days lonely nights
Where would I be without my womanLion in my winter
Im a lion with no crown
You want to make me big man
A star on a screen
Some kind of James Brown
Or something in between
But when I look for money
You smother me in charms
I cant live on glory
When youre bending both my arms
I I was a lion in winter
And man I had friends
For miles around
I was a lion in my winter
What goods a lion lord
Without a crown
Youre living in a cave man
Upon your marble throne
You think you own the heavens
But youve got to be alone
You know you know I prayed for sunshine
A woman with my name
I dont want to live man
You gave away the game
I I was a lion in winter
And man I had friends
For miles around
I was a lion in my winter
What goods a lion lord
Without a crown
I was a lion in my winter
What goods a lion lord
Without a crownTook a plane to Cairo
Then a Cessna to Rome
I got hijacked to Tel Aviv
And its the first time that Ive flown
But Ive found my Shangri-la
In a place thats not too far back home
Took a train to Jordan
And to Texas and back
I met Lyndon B Johnson and I felt his hand on my back
But I found my Shangri-la
In a place thats not too far back homeEverybody wants to leave
Just like you and I
I have all year to smile
A tear for every eye
Life closed its eyes broke my world now I cry
Ive got to tell you Ive got the reasons
Cause Im a man a man for all seasons alive
And would I pray
What makes the world go round
I havent got today
My mind is lost and found
Life closed its eyes and said goodbye now I cry
But Ive got to tell you Ive got my reasons
Cause Im a man a man for all seasons alive
And would I pray what makes the world go round
I havent got today my mind is lost and found
Do do do do do do doI hear you calling me dearest too
My dearest
Im nearest than Ive ever been before
To have you calling me dearest once more
My dearest this picture
My own memory
Wishing this picture be reality
Where do I go from here
The lord took you away
And if you could see me today
I will remember you
I will remember you
My dearest sincerest
Theres no one but you and
Here in my heart
Youre my dearest too
Where do I go from here
The lord took you away
And if you could see me today
I will remember you
I will remember you
My dearest sincerest
Theres no one but you and
Here in my heart
Youre my dearest tooIn the name of love and life
Turn your face to the lonely night
But youre not alone when she calls you home
And this your world is on the edge
As good as lost but you know the way
Through the faceless town
And she pulls me down
I know the place and the time of our lives
So long ago
And all through the years never dies
All things must pass
Irresistible force meets an immovable object and
Human animal madness and blood starts to flow
Invisible fingers and indescribable pleasure
I get to find my personal god
I get to find my personal god
God of love god of gold
Ring of fire in the days of old
Its what Im living for and loves the only law
So answer Mayday SOS
Search me North East South or West
Its all I miss just the one last kiss
This is goodbye to the days of our lives
My fair-weather friend
I feel your sorrow and tears they are mine
I share to the end
Irresistible force meets an immovable object and
Human animal magic
How far can you go
The rolling of thunder and
You decide what youre after
I get to find my personal god
I get to find my personal god
I surrender
All or nothing
You must spread your wings and fly
I know the place and the time of our lives
My fair-weather friend
I feel your sorrow and tears they are mine
We share to the end
When an irresistible force meets an immovable object
Human animal madness and blood starts to flow
Theres bound to be heartbreak
You make it the hard way
I surrender
All or nothing
You must spread your wings and flyIs this your voice I heard
Speakin my name
I hang on every word
Each letter that I write
Every day every night
But I just cant live and learn
Talkin to myself and believin
I could live without you
Livin on the lies and beleivin that
Love would stay
Listen to me please and Im beggin on
My knees before you
But you dont show me the way
No you dont show me the way
He may change youre world and someday
He may break your heart
And you deserve no better
If you love him I will step aside
I offer this to you
So leave me as I love you still
And if he dont keep you warm
You know I will
You know I will
So this is who you are
And the rest of my life
I dedicate to you
And I know that love cant wait
Theres a moon and a sun
And a dream that sees me through
A little bit of change and
A little bit of my desire
I was shakin all over and
I didnt know what to say
Im the man in the middle and
The middle man catches fire
But I dont know how to go away
No I dont know how to go away
He became your hero somehow
I became your clown
And you deserve no better but my love
Is here and all I found
I offer this to you
So leave me as I love you still
And if he dont take your heart
You know I will
It aint wise
It aint smart
You say theres no doubt about it
If you decide
You got somebody else
When I want you to myself
I cant stop
I cant look
I cant say no more about it
But my love will go on
Just as long as the river flows
He will be your king but someday
He may let you down
Follow to the letter that my love is
Real and what I found
I offer it to you
So leave me as I love you still
And if he dont keep you warm
You know I willNow that were alone
No more hide and seek
You are the highest dream to me
And as you softly sleep
then I can tell you what it means
Locked in my arms like lovers lie
I will not let you slip away
Is this the summer of them all
Is this my night of nights
that you came to stay
Here you are owner of my heart
just the way that love should be
And theres something I must say to you
if you promise to believe
that its you Im living for
and I could not love you more
Seasons may come and seasons go
but these are the truest words I know
Face to face eye to eye
This is the summer of of our lives
One love that cannot die
Here you are owner of my soul
never let you say goodbye
And there is something I must say to you
we leave the world outside
and you have come to me at last we start
Open up your heart
let my deepest love inside
Im only doing what I have to do
If you promise to believe
that I could not love you more
Here you are you are owner of my heart
just the way that love should be
And theres something I must say to you
we leave the world outside
and you have come to me at last at last we start
Open up your heart
let my deepest love inside ah
Im only doing what I have to do
If you promise to believe
that its you Im living for
that its you Im living for
and I could not love you moreSay you never send me away
Making me a memory and
Telling me to find me a life
Change theres no changing
What cannot be changed
And you are witness to a silent conversation
Nothing but the black of night
No-one ever takes your place
Gotta let the pantomime play
Not to worry my telepathy
I bring you into me theres be no separation
And I tell you
I will climb inside your world
And at the dawn of history
I was born to find this girl ah
And I can see you with my eyes closed
I can feel you when youre near me
Just the knowing that you
Hear me could be
You could measure my love
I can touch you with my hands tied words of love
It dont take no extra feeling you wont believe
Let your imagination just run take a hand
You can measure my love
And they tell you
They can stop those tears you cry
And we can ride that storm together
And all the love that lasts forever
And forever and forever
Cling to the vine and the vine never breaks
Its a message from a ship to shore
For the soul and the sacrifice
Pain
Theres no fury like a woman scorned
We could be victims of a lethal combination
Its the hour
Its the sword that hides the stone
And one of us holds the power
There to forge our hearts together
Here forever and forever
And I can feel you with my eyes closed words of love
I can feel you when youre near me where you are
Just the knowing that you hear me could be Ill survive
You could measure my love
I can touch you with my hands tied words of love
It dont take no extra feeling you wont believe
Let your imagination just run Ill survive
You can measure my love my loveStill waters run deep
Just remember when we lie to each other
No one wins and losers weep
Reflection will show
This connection we can lean on each other
This is all we need to know
Now I admit Ive been a fool sometimes
I believe I may be losing you
Its now or never we talk before a tear is shed
Under your spell and over my head
You took me in your arms and you told me
We dont need to worry but you
You never say youre sorry
Keep this love alive for us its all I feel
How can we survive if we change what is real
Still waters run deep
Just remember when we lie to each other
No one wins and losers weep
Reflection will show
This connection we can lean on each other
This is all we need to know
I see the angel and the devil in your heart
I confess either one is my addiction
And where youre leading me
I dont have the will to fight
Out of the darkness and into the light
But living in your arms I can take it
Please dont make me shiver
I know together we deliver
Let the gods decide
Who finds the sweetest thrill
Who can justify the truth
God I love you still
Still waters run deep
Just remember when we lie to each other
No one wins and losers weep losers weep
Deception will show
Its a struggle when youre starved for affection ah
This is all we need
Oooh
Dont let him get too close to you
youve got a stranger on your mind
The dream is free
I know Im only human if I cry
Or maybe we should kiss and say goodbye
Ah Girl I love you still
Still waters run deep
Just remember when we lie to each other ah
No one wins and losers weep no one wins
Deception will show show
Its a struggle when youre starved for affection
This is all we need to know
Still Still waters run deep
Just remember when we lie to each other
No one wins and losers weep
Reflection will show
This connection we can lean on each other
This is all we need to knowIt happened in the middle of the night
When I thought I had control
Didnt want to be the one to fight
Didnt want to lose my soul
I was up for something more
Never thought Id get it started
Paralyzed polarized hung on every word
Im in love with the child inside
I dont have a right to follow you
Or have a license to get closer
A love that wont be denied
For you are something like Ive never seen
Im a man whose heart is crying
Just another one of my obsessions
You dont want to be a special toy
I never be the one to hurt you
Like every other girl and boy
Just another little indiscretion
Another game that you want to try
You can never be unfaithful
If you gotta love somebody
Oh oh
Want to make your mountains high
Want to take your valley low
Theres a moral to my story
Let me in and close the door
Until the morning light
What Id give to live inside you
Make me wait
We separate but only to return
Whisper and Ill be there
I dont want you to beg me to stop
I just want to drown in your desire
Love is for those who dare
All the cream is rising to the top
And its the love you save from dying
Ah
Just another one of my obsessions
Something I could never find
Its the kind of love that makes your heart
Feel obsessed with mine
Any battle for the one possession
Another game that you want to try
You can never be unfaithful
If you gotta love somebody
Oh
Just another one of my obsessions
You dont want to be a special toy
I never be the one to hurt you
Like every other girl and boy
Just another little indiscretion
Another game that you want to try
You can never be unfaithful
If you gotta love somebody
Oh
Just another one of my obsessionsFrom the highest tower
I will call you home
Its the same old story
love will find its own oh
You come to me conspiracy of the night
The heart that you want just happens to be mine
Thieves in the dark you ought to be locked in chains
but you wind up on my side and what will be will be
That you wear a disguise the epitome of deceit
The face of a friend invisible on the street
If you are battling to be mine Im victorious in defeat
and I surrender I surrender I surrender
Anybody want me anyone know my name
Do it in a lifetime
you be dust and the soul survives
Evens up the score ah
From the highest tower
I will call you home
Its the same old story
love will find its own
And I surrender
take me for all time
Love that lasts forever
and I surrender
We are elite prisoners of the night
We fight to the finish and savour the delights
Its your body that got me beat and Im crumbling at your feet
I surrender I surrender I surrender
I surrender
I will walk through fire to keep you safe and sound oh no oh no
In the final hour turn my life around oh no
and I surrender take me for all time
You are the air that I breathe oh
I will walk through fire keep you safe and sound
In the final hour turn my life around oh
This is my life life story story Ive been lost and found oh no oh no
In the final hour in the final hour turn my life around oh no
And I surrender surrender
take me for all time
I surrender ah
love as warm as wine
I surrender ah ahMiracles happen
You know miracles happen
Miracles happen
You know miracles happen
If we just try
We can put it back together you and I
And all the bad is blown away
I never said goodbye
Is the writing on the wall
That makes you see
And its the saviour of my soul
And what I say that must be heard
With love in every word
Close your eyes dont let go
Dont get lost in the falling snow
Always out of place alone
With someone youre not sure of
Broken wings dont arrive
Its a storm but you still survive
Its gonna take a miracle
So I go around believing you
I say good night stay forever and
Nobody knows how much
I pray for you at night
And miracles happen
You know miracles happen
And yesterday
There was nothing in my life worth living for
You were there and I was born
The very strength to carry on
A miracle has come
Hold on tight call my name
Dont get caught in the midnight rain
Part of me believes in you
Youre someone Im not sure of
Dont look down Ill be there
Like the wind in the cold night air
I can see a miracle
And through it all we rise and fall
Tear it apart and stay forever
And I know where heaven is
And somewhere in between
Miracles happen
You know miracles happen
Red blue black and white
True light shine on anyone
Two hearts make it right
And all that love can change
Close my eyes dont let go
Ill be lost in the falling snow
Always out of place alone
With someone Im not sure of
Dont look down Ill be there
Like the wind in the cold night air
I can see a miracle
And through it all we rise and fall
We tear it apart and stay forever
And I know where heaven is
And somewhere in between
Miracles happen
Hold on tight call my name
Dont get caught in the midnight rain
Part of me believes in you
Youre someone Im not sure of
Dont look down Ill be there
Like the wind in the cold night air
I can see a miracle
Close my eyes dont let go
Ill be lost in the falling snowShell read your mind shes smart as a whip
Shell suck you dry but look at how much I drip
At the point of ecstasy I write a symphony
Of poetry in motion and leaving me there to die
I tell myself let no one take her place
To confide in someone and look at how much I paid
I want you next to me call it telepathy
We drifted into vision and look how much we see
I just want to get closer than close to you
I know that one way or the other
Any test of my faith will do
And lovers fall for lovers friends
We make each other cry
Living in each others lives
And trying to make the fantasy come true
But I just want to get closer than close to you
Baby I just want to get closer than close to you
Your soul is naked it tells you what it wants
I read your letter and look at how close Ive come
Theres more for us to see in this philosophy
We both end up in heaven and look at how close wed be
I
Just want to get closer than close to you
I know that one way or the other
Any test of my faith will do
I give my heart for you to break
I give my final breath
When nothing lasts forever see
What we can turn eternity into
And I just want to get closer than close to you
At the moment you discover
What the best of my love can do
And lovers fall for lovers friends
We make each other cry
Living in each others lives
And trying to make the fantasy come true
I just want to get closer than close to you
Baby I just want to get closer than close to youI was a midnight rider on a cloud of smoke
I could make a woman hang on every single stroke
I was an iron man I had a master plan
But I was alone
I could hear you breathing with a sigh of the wind
I remember how your body started trembling
Oh what a night its been and for the state Im in
Im still alone
And all the wonders made for the earth
And all the hearts in all creation
Somehow I always end up alone
Always end up alone always end up alone
So Ill play Ill wait
Cause you know that love takes time
Living love between the line
We came sha la so close so far
Just the beat of a lonely heart
And its mine and I dont want to be alone
Well since I got no message on your answer phone
Since youre busy every minute I just stay at home
I make believe you care I feel you everywhere
But Im still alone
Im on a wheel of fortune with a twist of fate
Cause I know it isnt heaven is it love or hate
Am I the subject of the pain
Am I the stranger in the rain I am alone
And is there glory there to behold
Maybe its my imagination another story there to be told
So I play sha la Ill wait sha la
And I pray its not too late
We came sha la so far so far
Just a beat of a lonely heart and its mi-i-ine
And I dont want to be alone
And all the wonders made for the earth
And all the hearts in all creation
Another story there to be told
So Ill play Ill wait
And Ill pray its not too late
We can so far
Just the beat of a lonely heart
And its mine
And I dont want to be alone
Gone but not out of sight
Im caught in the rain and theres no one home
Face the heat of the night
The one that you loves got a heart thats made of stone
Shine and search for the light
And sooner or later youll be cruising on your ocean
And clean out of site
Im caught in the rain and theres no one homeWhen I was a boy all the books I read
I followed like a blind man
To heed the words my father said
Those golden summers faded into night words become a dream
The echoes of my childhood and where the path is winding
May God bless you keep you safe from harm
I stand by you always
Time and motion
Hands touch lips find a way to heaven on high
Watch the children play the child becomes a man
And all the tangled webs we weave
You swear it as you live and breathe
We stay together death until you part
Winner takes the prize
The futures at your fingertips right before your eyes
Chorus
No more sorrows
smoke and mirrors
No more nights with no end
I really learned a lot smoke and mirrors
I see my tomorrows
And nothing from nothing
And ashes to ashes they say
All the more that you reach out
The more that it runs away
Smoke and mirrors
Chorus
No more goodbyes
Thats all I ever got smoke and mirrors
No lies you find your way there
Show me what shes got smoke and mirrors
Heaven on high
May God bless you keep you from all harm
I stand my you always
Time and motion
Smoke and mirrors
Hands touch lips find a way to
Thats all I ever got smoke and mirrors
Heaven on high
No more sorrows
I really learned a lot smoke and mirrors
No more nights with no end
Show me what shes got smoke and mirrors
I rise or I fall
No more goodbyes
She really makes me hot smoke and mirrors
No lies you find a way there
Heaven on highIn the history of a life takes a heart
When the power of love comes together
There aint nothing can tear us apart
And the touch of your hand I can feel
That what we got is stronger than steel
Thats when you hear
My lovers prayer
Its my own silent message to you
Takes me there my lovers prayer
And my soul is divided in two
With my love on the line
I send it all over the world
Out on the air
Cause I cant let go
And my heart has a mind of its own
Its my lovers prayer
Its the mystery of a place blessed by us
And the moment of truth is forever
In the face of incredible odds
And the look in your eyes tells me why
Let our words burn a sign in the sky
My lovers prayer
Its as easy as talking to you
All my life having you there
In my own private vision come true
Its heaven on Earth
Youre the fire and all that Im worth
And I can be strong
You hold the key
Dont say its over dont say its over
Dont say its over for me dont say its over
My lovers prayer my lovers prayer
Its as easy as talking to you its easy its easy
All my life having you there
In my own private vision come true
In my search for your love
I send it all over the world
Its all I can bear
And the nights get long
But my heart holds on
Its no empty words
My lovers prayer my lovers prayer
Its my own silent message to you message to you message to
Takes me there my lovers prayer oh
And my soul is divided in two
Cause I cant cant let go oh cant
And my heart has a mind of its own
Its my lovers prayerGo on with your song bird you cant go wrong bird
You will go on and on bird like you did before
Though your wings are broken the sky is so wide open
And the wind is waiting for you like an open door
Though you go so far away your voice will still be heard so well
Youll never really ever know how beautiful you are
When the moon is on the rise Ill try to make my songbird fly
I wonder if he ever will and if he really did how far
Go on with your song bird you cant go wrong bird
You will go on and on bird like you did before
Though your wings are broken the sky is so wide open
And the wind is waiting for you like an open door
Though you go so far away your voice will still be heard so well
Youll never really ever know how beautiful you are
When the moon is on the rise Ill try to make my songbird fly
I wonder if he ever will and if he really did how far
Go on with your song bird you cant go wrong bird
You will go on and on bird through the open door
Go on with your song bird you cant go wrong my bird
You will go on and on bird like you did before
Like you did beforeone thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five
About an hour or more when I go upstairs you can read between the lines
I can make it to the top but then I gotta stop
But Im all right Im really fine
Its just the wine and all this making love
In a day or so itll realJust my dog and I
At the edge of the universe
Well I didnt want to bring her
And I know itll make her worse
Now I look out on forever
And it must be nice down there
And they call me Shenandora in the air
Well Im ten feet tall
But Im only three feet wide
And I live inside an ocean that flows
On the other side
If I came back down tomorrow
Would it all be far too soon
And it looks like its gonna be a lovely afternoon
I thought that I was going home
And all the way I kept on prayin
I couldnt stop to turn around
Well here I am and here Im stayin
Its been my longest journey
And Ive come through the black of night
I was tired and hungry
When I saw your distant light
Well I know this may sound crazy
But Im sure I got here first
Im just me Shenandora
At the edge of the universe
I thought that I was going home
And all the way I kept on prayin
I couldnt stop to turn around
Well here I am and here Im stayin
Just my dog and I
At the edge of the universe
Well I didnt want to bring her
And I know itll make her worse
Now I look out on forever
And it must be nice down there
And they call me Shenandora in the air
At the edge of the universe repeat one thousand times and relax youre in heavenSo warm is my morning sun red is my rainbow
Soft is the cool summer breeze when I saw your face
I saw the light in your eyes so dark and demanding
Like a light in the storm
Whenever I cry my friend
Youre always away and so I pretend
If I could live the dreams that I see
Long live my love
Walking in country country lanes country lanes
Ill never belong to someone again
Living my whole life through
Long live my love for you
My life has meaning now I am a window
And all things seem clear to me now
Like a light in the storm
Whenever I cry my friend
Youre always away and so I pretend
If I could live the dreams that I see
Long live my love
Walking in country country lanes country lanes
Ill never belong to someone again
Living my whole life through
Long live my love
Walking in country country lanes country lanes
Ill never belong to someone again
Living my whole life through
Long live my love for youHere am I one sad and lonely guy
One shadow of the man I used to be
Now its past the love I thought would last
You thought I had you chained
And now youre free
I know its wrong but Im still holding on
Still praying you will soon come back to me
But then you go you let your feelings show
You said I gave you pain and now I see
But baby as you turn away
I will always think of what we had together
Baby this is just your way of breaking my heart
And its easier to say goodbye
Making me fall making me try try to make
You stay as you turn away
Now youre gone this road I walk upon is just
Another place where I can hide
Im still your man theres proof of who I am
Except without your love Im dead inside
But baby as you turn away
I will always think of what we had together
Baby this is just your way of breaking my heart
And its easier to say goodbye
Making me fall watching me try try to make
You stay as you turn awayIf my life gets like a jig saw
With the pieces out of place
Come on over
Put a smile back on my face
And if all my bad days came at once
You would know just what to do
Come on over
Baby you will see me through
And if you think I need you
Come on over
Bring your love around
You can dry away my tears
And if you think I need you
Come on over
Lay your body down
You know I will be here
So bring your love around
When I can not see in front of me
You would know my darkest day
Come on over
You can take it all away
And if you think I need you
Come on over
Bring your love around
You can dry away my tears
And if you think I need you
Come on over
Lay your body down
You know I will be here

That makes me know theres a party somewhere
Burn baby burn
Burn baby burn
To my surprise one hundred storeys high
People getting loose yall theyre getting down on the roof
Folks are screaming out of control it was so entertaining
When that boogie-woogie started to explode
I heard somebody say
Burn baby burn
Disco Inferno burn that mother down
Burn baby burn
Disco Inferno burn that mother down
Satisfaction came in a chain reaction
I couldnt get enough so I had to self-destruct
The heat was on and it was rising to the top
Everybodys going strong that is when my spark got hot
I heard somebody say
Burn baby burn
Disco Inferno burn that mother down
Burn baby burn
Disco Inferno burn that mother down
Burn it on down
Satisfaction came in a chain reaction
I couldnt get enough so I had to self-destruct
The heat was on it was rising to the top
Everybodys going strong that is when my spark got hot
I heard somebody say
Burn baby burn
Disco Inferno burn that mother down
Burn baby burn
Disco Inferno burn that mother down
Burn it on down
Burn baby baby wont you burn burn
Burn burn
Incomprehensible
Incomprehensible
And burn baby let the good times roll with me
On a cold and gray Chicago morn
A poor little baby child is born in the ghetto
And if theres one thing that you dont need
Its another hungry mouth to feed in the ghetto
People dont you understand
That the child dont need a helping hand in the ghetto
And a hungry little boy with a runny nose
Plays in the street as the cold wind blows in the ghetto
So he starts to roam the streets at night
And he learns how to steal and he learns how to fight in the ghetto
And then he buys a gun and he steals a car
And he drives away but he dont get far in the ghetto
As a crowd gathers round an angry young man
Face down on the street with a gun in his hand in the ghetto
And his momma cries
Oh baby baby burn that disco down
Youre gonna burn youre gonna burn
Youre gonna burn burn burn burn
Burn burn burn burn burn burn
Burn baby burn
Disco Inferno burn that mother down
Burn baby burn
Disco Inferno burn that mother down
Burn baby burn
Disco Inferno burn that mother down
Burn baby burn
Disco Inferno burn that mother down
Burn it down
Let the good times roll
Get us loose as a goose

But now you take my breath away
Suddenly youre in my life
A part of everything I do
You got me workin day and night
Just tryin to keep a hold on you
Here in your arms I found my paradise
My only chance for happiness
And if I lose you now I think I would die
Say youll always be my baby
We can make it shine
We can take forever just a minute at a time
More than a woman
More than a woman to me
More than a woman
More than a woman to me
There are stories old and true
Of people so in love like you and me
And I can see myself
Let history repeat itself
Reflecting how I feel for you
And thinking about those people then
I know that in a thousand years
Id fall in love with you again
This is the only way that we should fly
This is the only way to go
And if I lose your love I know I would die
Oh say youll always be my baby
We can make it shine
We can take forever just a minute at a time

Im surviving every lonely day
When theres got to be
No chance for me
My life would end
And it dont matter how I cry
My tears of love
Are a waste of time
If I turn away
Am I strong enough to see it through
Go crazy is what I will do
If I cant have you
I dont want nobody baby
If I cant have you oh oh oh oh
If I cant have you
I dont want nobody baby
If I cant have you oh oh oh
Cant let go
And it doesnt matter how I try

There is movement all around

Maybe I talk too slow
But youve got to live a little bit faster
cause youve got a little less time to go
I aint lost and I aint searching
But then you know me very well
And I cant change the wind and make it blow the other way
Im a fool and I can tell
That Im alive and thats all
That I can get up just as fast as I fall
And I can walk and run but Ill never crawl
And in the end it doesnt matter at all
I dont know about the people that I read about in books
And the Kings and Queens around my room with their quiet dirty looks
I know I should be going somewhere I just cant arrive
Theres a reason for believing that Ive never been alive alive
I aint lost and I aint searching
But then you know me very well
And I cant change the world and make it go the other way
Im a fool and I can tellI can make the sun shine out of the heavens
Sweet love love you forever
Just wait until the suns on your pillow
I can bring love cause thats all Ive got
I can bring love cause thats all Ive got
I can change the whole world if you are near me
No tears if you can hear me
Just wait until the suns on your pillow
I can bring love cause thats all Ive got
I can bring love cause thats all Ive got yeah
Ah
Just wait until the suns on your pillow
I can bring love cause thats all Ive got
I can bring love cause thats all Ive got
I can bring love cause thats all Ive gotEvery time I need reality in jeopardy of losing all of me
I just am not stronger life dont last so long so baby
If your turned out the light if you turned out the light
Please dont turn out the light please dont turn out the light
Turn out the lights
Baby I dont feel too reliable
I can only do what Im liable but if you want to leave me
Love me and just leave me baby
If you turned out the light if you turned out the light
Please dont turn out the light please dont turn out the light
Turn out the lights
Turn out the lightsIve never been alone and Ive only seen the sky
Still I know the reason why Ive been thinking it over
Ive never climbed a tree but thats natural for me
And you dont know my name so Im thinking it over
And evry day Im learning the things that are concerning you and I
And if you were beside me youd know whats inside me so tell me why
Give me inspiration to clear the situation weve known too long
And if we end up crying then one of us is lying so tell me
Never rode a plane and I never will again
So til then Ill drink the rain while Im thinking it over
And evry day Im learning the things that are concerning you and I
And if you were beside me youd know whats inside me so tell me why
Give me inspiration to clear the situation weve known too long
And if we end up crying then one of us is lying so tell me
Never rode a plane and I never will again
So til then Ill drink the rain while Im thinking it over
Yes Im thinking it overWe must have lost the road
Dont you think its getting late
Maybe if its colder
We can stop and wait
We must have lost the words
All the little things we said
And now the world is frozen
Only you in my head
Aah we lost the road Repeat 
We must have lost the tune
Where did I step out of line
Ill search for the melody
That calls you mine
Aah we lost the road Repeat 
Aah we lost the road we lost the road we lost the road yeah
Aah we lost the road ah we lost yeah yeah
Aah we lost the road we lost the road we lost the road oh yeah
Ah we lost the road we lost the roaddont you know we lost the road
Aah we lost the roadI can feel you sweet song of summer
Your music comforts my lonely reign
I can hear you in evil darkness
That empty feeling Im near you again
I am your forever and this I emphasize
Your never ending hurting and criticize
We are friends forever and this is emphasize
Your never ending hurting and criticizeIf ever you got rain in your heart
Someone has hurt you and torn you apart
Am I unwise to open up your eyes to love me
And let it be like they said it would be
Me loving you girl and you loving me
Am I unwise to open up your eyes to love me
Run to me whenever youre lonely to love me
Run to me if you need a shoulder
Now and then you need someone older
So darling you run to me
And when youre out in the cold
No one beside you and no one to hold
Am I unwise to open up your eyes to love me
And when youve got nothing to lose
Nothing to pay for nothing to choose
Am I unwise to open up your eyes to love me
Run to me whenever youre lonely to love me
Run to me if you need a shoulder
Now and then you need someone older
So darling you run to me
Run to me whenever youre lonely
Run to me if you need a shoulder
Now and then you need someone older
So darling you run to me
Run to me whenever youre lonely
Run to me if you need a shoulder
Now and then you need someone olderIve got a notion to live in an ocean of bad bad dreams
No consolation to mixed conversation in bad bad dreams
You know were all alike
We can shout and scream and yell all night
Its just a bad bad dream
Feel like Im crying theres no use denying its all been done
For your information we still own the nation the wars been won
You know youre far too late
Your only hangup is you hesitate
Its just a bad bad dream
Bad bad bad dream Repeat 
Im getting it to you so you get it through you and make your choice
People start playing and back what youre saying in just one voice
You know youre all insane it doesnt matter how you play the game
Its just a bad bad dreamYesterday was history who knows what there is gonna be when we meet again
Will you smile and tell the world about me
Can there be no doubt about me I was your friend
As I gaze upon a sea of smiling faces
Walk amongst the glow of moonlit places
The look in your eyes to see your smile
Wont bring you back to me
I remember things we planned
The world would never understand but we found a way
And the world of love you gave to me
Each moment is a memory whatever they say
As I gaze upon a sea of smiling faces
Walk amongst the glow of moonlit places
The look in your eye to see you smile
Wont bring you back to me
For the look in your eye to see your smile
Wont bring you back to me
Yesterday was history who knows what there is gonna be when me meet again
Will you smile and tell the world about me
Can there be no doubt about me I was your friend
As I gaze upon a sea of smiling faces
Walk amongst the glow of moonlit places
The look in your eye to see your smile
Wont bring you back to me
For the look in your eye to see your smile
Wont bring you back to me
For the look Repeat I would die for you
I have cried for you believe me girl
Dont you think its time you made up your own mind
All my loves for you
All I dos for you
Still I think its time you made up your own mind
A melody my symphony
You know its for you love
Its plain to see its meant to be
Now its up to you love
Still Ill wait for you
Waiting just for you dont leave me girl
Dont you think its time you made up your own mind
Love is here for you
Love was made for you believe me girl
Dont you think its time you gave up
You are mine
You know its for you Repeat I held a party and nobody came
Strangely I was upset
Poured out a drink and then Birkworth approached saying
Have no regrets Maybe your gentle friends had some delay
Dont try to take on the world
Made up my bed and decided to sleep
Dreaming I was awake
Maybe I drank an excess of my drink
Nice clan cordial crowd
Birkworth suggested we sleep through the night

I carry my sacrifice
For the sake of the millions
All night you be the light on the water
You be the pride and the sorrow
Shower your love to me there
Summer dies before the rain
Unify every soul together be lonely
Ride on follow me to the sunrise
Save me the world that is broken
Nothing but love to be there
Chorus
Soldiers father and son are soldiers
Nowhere to run we fight ore we die
For what are we living for boys never cry
Soldiers mother and child are soldiers
The meek and the mild we stand ore we fall
Never mind dry your eyes you never be far away
Forever beside me hold out I will be your tomorrow
I will walk trough the fire nothing but love to be there
Chorus
Bridge
Im a little misunderstood
Living all the daydreams and nightmares dont do me no good
Im a little bit on the moon
But when the world is you love me
No moment is to soon
release
All night you be the light on the water
You be the pride and the sorrow
Shower your love to me there
Chorus Wildflower
Sacrifice everything in a wonderland that you know
Its crazy that Im clear out of my mind
A wonderful place to be
Wildflower
Sweet as the morning light
If I blink an eye will you go
Im starting to care much more then I dare
A wonderful thing to see
And what do we know
First say you love me
And then say you leave me
But we never say goodbye
God youre an angel
But even an angel must choose
Someone will hurt you and when you stop running
Theres only this love of mine
Wildflower
Sacrifice everything in a wonderland that you know
If older is wise
One look in your eyes
Im younger then I should be
And only time
Waiting for you
To growClose your eyes do what you wanna
Baby how can I wait much longer
Make it hard to believe it happened to me
Morning comes too late tomorrow
All you lose is the dream you borrow
All you got is a soul thats born to be free
and cries to the wind
Waiting for you
My dream will find you someday
I stand beside my vision of you
And have you loving me
I still love you
I still love you
Though youre my imagination
You be there when we find salvation
Only then will there be no reason to hide
Stormy night out in the heaven
I believe in the true forever
Theres a bright new star when somebody dies
I cry to the wind
Waiting for you
Sweet love returning someday
The day you learn love happened to you
You will be here with me
I still love you
I still love you
Ill be waiting for you
Sweet love returning someday
The day you learn love happened to you
You will be here with me
I still love you
I still love you
I still RepeatsChorus one
Dont fall in love with me baby
Its love that just wont last
Your eyes are looking out at the future
But you see the past
You know love was made for a dreamer
But when the dream is out of sight
Well all youre gonna get in the morning is a lonely night
Nothing but a lonely night
Gonna be a lonely night
Saving it all for something wild and wonderful
Holding it down theres gotta be another horizon
Keep it inside
Dont throw away your precious love
Cause if you need to be free you can take it
Not a prison of love that you make it
Dont fall in love with me baby
Its a love that just wont last
Your eyes are looking out of the future
But you see the past
You know hearts where made to be broken
And your love has broken mine
Now all youre gonna get in the morning is a lonely night
Nothing but a lonely night
Gonna be a lonely night
You gonna be bleu
Saving it all for something wild and wonderful
Holding it down theres gotta be another horizon
Keep it inside
Dont throw away your precious love
Cause if you need to be free you can take it
Not a prison of love that you make itI wasnt born to be alone that was a lesson I was shown
To know that love was just a lie
I ran away to think it over
But its over and I try to take a stand on what is real
Someone has shown me how to feel
Im like a shadow in the night
Im like a river in an ocean
Im a flame without a light
And now Im cryin evry day
And Ive been cryin evry day
And I been think of your love
I keep turnin I keep turnin
I keep turnin I keep turnin
Well your love is a cathedral and I came down here to pray
And now Im cryin evry day
Can there be any wonder why to be living under
love is a revelation only few can share
I could be a mountain strong but the pain about you
Long as I live without you
I would still be there
I wanna die die away
Never lovenever cry
And I been walkin in the rain
And I been hangin on a dream
All the faces and the places that our love has ever been
Now Im cryin evry day
And I been cryin evry day
And I been thinkin of your love
I keep turnin I keep turnin
I keep turning I keep turnin
Well your love is a cathedral and I came down here to pray
And now Im cryin evry day
Can there be any wonder why to be living under
love is a revelation only few can share
I could be a mountain strong but the pain about you
Long as I live without you I would still be there
I wanna die die away
Never love never cry
I wasnt born to be a fool but Im a fool to be around
Im a man without a country Im a King without a crown
And then youre throwin me away
Another world another time
But if anyone belongs to anybody you were mine
And Im cryin evry day
And I been cryin evry day
And Ive been thinkin of your love
I keep turnin I keep turnin
I keep turnin I keep turning
Well your love is a cathedral and I came down here to pray
And now Im
RepeatI was stood by the light as I looked through the window
With the greatest intention not meaning to see
I was there in the dark and I saw you together
You were up in his arms I was down on my knees
Get the cards on the table
No need to pretend
Youve got to be cruel to be kind
He can sell you his love and you know yo will pay cause
Hes a liar
Hes a liar and I should know liar
Hes a liar and I should know - ahhh
Well they told me I fell but I just dont remember
I was standing face down they were there at my feet
There was smoke in the air and sweet smell of leather
I was through the window and down in the street
Well Im cold and Im hungry but Im still alive
And its not how I want it to be
Theres a hand on my shoulder
He said Ill survive but-
Hes a liar
Hes a liar and I should know liar
Hes a liarand I should know-ahhh
Release
Was it not for the man that was blocking the drive
Was it not for the red limousine
Id be millions of miles from th scene of the crime
And somehow in this madness believe she was mine -but
Im a liar
Hes a liar
And I should know liar
Hes a liar
And I should know-ahhh
Hes a repeat and fadeBe who you are
Dont ever change
The world was made to measure for your smile
So smile
Those crazy dreams
We threw we threw away
I never been alone with you
I never could
They say
That love will find a way
And love will never be set free
I wont ever let you see
You could not understand
You never will
Be who you are
I bless I bless your name
And all that summer madness caused the rain
And we we
The glory that we made
My love will grace the halls of time
A love that never can be mine
You could not love me then
I love you still
Be who you are
Seize life and find a way
And I will be that shadow loving who you are
Be who you are
We wereLonely people gathering
There be one gonna be the last
Time wasted
Gonna be seen to be gone
Run a mile for a minute
Gonna mind another day without you in it
Chorus
And you
You promised me paradise
Dont go back on your word
No you
You promised me paradise
Al my days of loving you under my skin
Gonna be a wild wild world
When nobody wants to give in
Gonna call me on the hour
Gonna mind if I dont hear it
I would hate to be you
Chorus
Bridge
Can you tell me if theres gonna be another reason to cry
Will I be the last to know
Unless we make another way of doing what we do
We dont believe it anymore
Will I be the one to cry
Problems problems haunting me
Circle my head
Gonna be a wild world
Let me hide away under your bed
Run a mile for a minute
Gonna mind another day without you in it
ChorusBaby when theres only one embrace
One is just enough for two
When do I learn young fingers get burned
Never my love
And when evryone has been a friend
Windy day we never knew
Now nothing can stand the way it was planned
No baby
Nothing could be good as
Nothing could be good as lovin you
Even tho youre far away
Youre movie plays in my mind
Youre world is what you see
Let it be me
And I can make you warm at night
But I need to be sure you got love enough to know
Nevernever
And when every cloud has lost its glow
Raining on my avenue
When do I hide that feeling inside
When baby
Nothing could be good as
Nothing could be good as lovin you
Even tho your far way your movie plays in my mind
Your world is what you see
Let it be me
And I can make you warm at night
But I need to be sure you got love enough to know
Nevernever
And when everyone has gone away
Sing to the Almighty if its what you need to feel do
The world is realtrue
And baby nothing could be good as
Nothing could be good as lovin you
As loving you Repeat Would you believe me if I told you your tomorrow is my yesterday
But be alive I know that we will
The world keeps on moving but Im holding still
In the beginning I was far away and praying for my destiny
That would arrive the moment youre born
For we will be here when the miracle comes
Chorus
Living eyes when under the sun dont cry
No war in my mind
The state of my heart
Living eyes when out in the rain will fall
The day I deny the face of my love
Bridge
We are of age we are in time we are forever
Right now when the power is mine
I leave you Heaven and the Earth I leave you never
And living to love is the reason to shine
I been over I been under I dont own a dream to analyze
But living eyes you know that I do
Believe in the soul and the magic of you
Chorus
Bridge
ChorusThere she goes my daytime girl
Spreading her wings like a high flying eagle
All the people will stare as she falls to the ground
Heaven knows my daytime girl
Never been kissed she dont know what shes missing
All the kisses there are to be found
All the wisdom of people she used
She took advantage of this
Taking time to remember the past
Remembering all she has missed
What a dream this place has been
Said when she left I believed when I saw him
All the seeing believing come true
All the wisdom of people she used
She took advantage of this
Taking time to remember the past
Remembering all she has missed
There she goes my daytime girl
Spreading her wings like a high flying eagle
All the people will stare as she falls to the groundI could be king of kings wear a crown and all the things
Id want Id never need
Id be an ace in an aeroplane and every year Id fly to Spain
If I could get the nerve to plant the seed
Chorus
Oh tell me how to say goodbye
I see her face in myself
Why tell me why I made her cry
If only had my mind on something else
Captain of the submarine beneath the icebergs never seen
A hero with a medal for everyday
I find me famereach the top
I keep on pushing never stop
If I could just forget her name
ChorusIncidentally there should some changes made
Youve got to work if you should have to save
An apple is a fool but lemons never do forget
Youve got to play it cool before they come and throw the net
Wait a while and straighten out the tie you wear
Youve got to take it easy if you dare
An apple is a fool but lemons never do forget
Youve got to play it cool before they come and throw the net
Dont be blind youve got a thinking mind
Stop the bells that ring so loud
Dont nod your head youll draw a crowd
Just think of everything youve worked so hard to bring
The lemon sings my song
Hes known it all along
Incidentally there should be some changes made
Youve got to work if you should have to save
An apple is a fool but lemons never do forget
Youve got to play it cool before they come and throw the net
Dont be blind youve got a thinking mind
Stop the bells that ring so loud
Dont nod your head youll draw a crowd
Just think of everything youve worked so hard to bring
The lemon sings my song
Hes known it all along
Incidentally there should be some changes made
Youve got to work if you should have to save
An apple is a fool but lemons never do forget
Youve got to play it cool before they come and throw the netSunday morning woke up yawning filled the pool for a swim
Pulled down the head and looked in the glass just to see if I was in
Went up the stairs and kissed my woman to make her come alive
cause with fifteen kids and a family on the skids
I got to go for a Sunday drive
Fifteen kids and a family on the skids
I got to go for a Sunday drive
Thats how they are so I grabbed out the car convertible fifty-nine
Headed to the freeway tried to find the Pasadena sign
Ten miles and three quarters I wasnt feeling any more alive
cause with fifteen kids and a family on the skids
I got to go for a Sunday drive
Fifteen kids and a family on the skids
I got to go for a Sunday drive
I used to be a minstrel free with a whole lot of bread in my bag
I used to feel that my life was real but the good Lord threw me a snag
Now Im gonna be the same as me no matter how I try
Cause with fifteen kids and a family on the skids
I got to go for a Sunday drive
Fifteen kids and a family on the skids
I got to go for a Sunday drive
Turned round the car and headed for home I guess I realized my fate
Ten miles and three quarters more I pulled up outside the gate
Twenty more kids were stood inside and that made thirty-five
Cause with an orphanage full of thirty-five kids
I got to go for a Sunday drive
An orphanage full of thirty-five kids
I got to go for a Sunday drive
Sunday morning woke up yawning filled the pool for a swim
Pulled down the glass and looked in the mirror just to see if I was in
Went up the stairs and kissed my woman to make her come alive
cause with an orphanage full of thirty-five kids
I got to go for a Sunday drive
An orphanage full of thirty-five kids
I got to go for a Sunday drive
OhMother Im going to join the Air Force today

But Im going to join the Air Force today
MotherI dont care what my father might think
Perhaps its going to drive him to drink
But I dont care what my father might think

Alone on the ground Now I find

Mother Mother MotherNow Ive been accused of going Hollywood
Chasing some cinematic schemes
But Ill give you Panavision pictures
cause you give me Technicolor dreams
Up there walking on air
Id like to show you how
I loved you way back then
As much as I need you now
Some people like to send the world away
Some sunlight on some silver beams
And Ill give you Panavision pictures
cause you give me Technicolor dreams
Oh wow look at us now
All of our dreams fulfill
I would implore you still
From under your windowsill
Sometimes Id like to send the world away
Some sunlight on some silver beams
So Ill give you Panavision pictures
cause you give me Technicolor dreams
Technicolor dreams
Ill give you Panavision pictures
Cause you give me Technicolor dreams
Go far follow your star
Ill help you climb that hill
I would adore you still
From under your windowsill
Sometimes Id like to send the world away
Some sunlight under some silver beams
So Ill give you Panavision pictures
Cause you give me Technicolor dreams
Technicolor dreamsI fail to understand
Why you dont want my hand
I try to find whats on your mind
I wonder
Chorus
Why dont you stop and see
Why youre not loving me
Would it hurt to say Hello
Or dont you know
One minute women please
Id go down on my knees
To say to you with a word so true
I love you
ChorusIt hurts me when you cry
When you feel the love is gone
Dont give up on us
When you got so much to believe in
And I beg you please stay
Strangers in the night
A flame that never dies
In a world of lonely faces
You need someone to survive
A heart like yours
Should never live alone
Chorus
Let me be your bodyguard
I can be useful to you
We can just get excited
Stop before we go too far
Let me be your bodyguard
Living in my protection
We can just get ignited
Lost inside
Its only you and me
Theres things you shouldnt do
You lose your self control
Should the eyes of a perfect stranger
Take you down to a new sensation
Just turn back to me
Dont wait till its gone
Dont go where you dont belong
In this world of pain and sorrow
Every wish is your command
A heart like yours
Should always find a home
I know the signs and Im telling you
Youre living on borrowed time
But a heart needs love
Like a flower needs rain
Like Im making you mine
Let me be your bodyguard
I can be useful to you
We can just get excited
Stop before we go too far my love my life
Let me be your bodyguard
Living in my protection
We can just get ignited
What we had never known all our lives
I pray its not too late
I would die by your side my love
Im the life that you save
In this world of pain and sorrow
Every wish is your command
A heart like yours should never live alone
I used to dream of a special one
And now I feel it coming true
But I couldnt let go Im a jealous guy
What youre putting me through
Im begging you
Let me be your bodyguard
I can be useful to you
We can just get excited
Stop before we go too far my love my life
Let me be your bodyguard
Living in my protection
We can just get ignited
Stop before we go too far
Stop before we go too far my love my life
Stop before we go too far my love my life

Stop before we go too far my love my life

Stop before we go too far my love my life
Let me be your bodyguard
I can be useful to you
We can just get excited
Stop before we go too farLets get started
Move in for the kill
So sincere
Im here to bend your will
A man without a face
I give you love youve never known
We can hold each other sight unseen
Touchin on our darkest dream
You can wish for something bad
Lovers lips you never had
All she wants is your love
All she wants is your love
Chorus
Were the party with no name
And we go from flame to flame
Weve got one claim to fame
Were the party with no name
Make those footsteps to the floor
You cant see us anymore
Aint no time for the shame
For the party with no name
Easy money
Get yourself a job
Its my invitation
Been alone too long
A soul without a space
A party with no mane
Truth is there but she dont see
Her life is just a mystery
Id give her more than I could give
Id even die that she could live
All she wants is your love
All she wants is your love
Were the party with no name
And we go from flame to flame
Weve got one claim to fame
Were the party with no name
All she wants is your love
All she wants is your love
ChorusI can relate the story of my life
No brighter hope no stronger emotion
And I believed I could die over you
How you could ever
Break down and never see me through
Through my darkest night
And as I lie awake
One prayer within me burning
And theres no price on what you hold till its gone
Then it keeps moving on
Where is my heart
You know I will be waiting to be a part of you
And never feel the pain
How can you say to me that I should go on living
I left the only life I had with you
The only love
No use in me pretending
To be a part of you
And you the heart of me
How can you say to me that I should go on living
I left the only life I had
With with you
With you
So we agree to let each other go
No long goodbye
Just your way and my way
And I can stand how you cried to be free
High as the wind blows
But not enough to bring you home to me
And only lonely knows
You see my open arms
You know my flame is burning
But Im too blind to see the end has begun
And it keeps moving on
The only love
No use in me pretending
To be a part of you
And you the heart of me
How can you say to me that I should go on living
I left the only life I had
With you
The only love
No use in me pretending
To be a part of you
And you the heart of me
How can you say to me that I should go on living
I left the only life I had
With you
The only love
One love that will not die
You may be sorry that I built my world around you
The only love
Is only you and I
There will be others who would leave you as I found you
The only love
One love that will not dieIm not that someone whos got what you want
I can do nothing but watch what you do
You just want someone to kiss you good night
But lips are never enough to get you through
You stole my nights and you got your way
Now you got me dying inside oh baby
Ebony dont walk out on me
Listen to what I say
Pick up the pieces of my life
Into the night of day
How do you break this heart of steel
Nobody ever could
Open the pages of my life
Im only flesh and blood
Ill be your saviour but baby I swear
Im not living my life over you
Some satisfaction you get if you dare
But is it ever enough to get you through
You stole my mind and you watch me fall
Now you leave the scene of the crime oh no
Ebony dont walk out on me
I never thought you could
Im only what you make of me
Im only flesh and blood
Im only flesh and blood
When youre gone
Youll be leaving behind
A broken man with something to hide
Oh lost in the night in a town without pity
You learn how to cry you learn how to cry
Ebony dont walk out on me
Listen to what I say ooh
Pick up the pieces of my life into the night of day ooh
How do you break this heart of steel
Nobody ever could ooh
Open the pages of my life
Im only flesh and blood ooh
Gone are the days that came and went
Houses are made of wood ooh
Live in a world of sand and stone
Im only flesh and blood ooh
Ebony dont walk out on me
I never thought you could
Im only what you make of me
Im only flesh and bloodTheres a law in what we do
We got a quest for something new
Everything you witness seems to
Let you down
If someone gets you from behind
I got an open mind
And youve been thirsty for the friend you found
Close your eyes and make a wish
I dont wanna mess with mother nature
Knowing that youre mine
You said I could see
You with another and we all get satisfied
Chorus
Its a form of evolution
Its a kind of movin on
An eternal source of pleasure
In being the one
When your love is for the giving
Its a case of destiny
You know we look for the same insane games
Got to be commital to be a little deviation
So I get all wound up inside
I can see your scene unwind
You dance together or you dance alone
And leave the real world in the air
Love it in leather I dont care
Everything is legal in the danger zone
Close your eyes and make a wish
Later we could cater to the animal
Knowing that youre mine
Its straight in my face
You and your lover and the brain is paralyzed
Its a form of evolution
Its a kind of movin on
Its a cycle of emotion
In being the one
In the storm of revolution
What is done can be undone
You know we look for the same insane games
Got to be committal
To the subtle variations
Its a form of evolution
Its a kind of movin on
Its a cycle of emotion
In being the one
If your love is for the givin
Its a case of destiny
And you can find your source of pleasure
In being with me
ChorusIve come to feel that youre a blessing in disguise
Find a way of making sure
Is what you show to me the devil in your eyes
Are you the killer or the cure
I could be the fire you start
At just the mention of your name
I rise and I rise up to heaven my love
And let you shoot me down in flames
You dont take me serious
Too insane to see youre just too good to be true
And I dont sympathize with those
Who crawl home to you
Your head is on the line you find no other love
And I would go through hell for you
Tell me will you ever let me in
Tell me will you ever let me in
Maybe the trick is to be taken by surprise
And lady be wise beware
The way to make you make that final sacrifice
The dream is real for those who dare
I will redefine your life
We remember till we die
When love is in motion who needs
More than this
And soon we know what passion is
All is fair in love and war
Its what Im fighting for but youre just too good
To be true
And I dont sympathize with those
Who crawl home to you
Your head is on the line you find no other love
And I would go through hell for you
Tell me will you ever let me in
Tell me will you ever let me in
I will be the fire you start
At just the mention of your name
All is fair in love and war
You know what Im fighting for
Love has shot me serious
Right between the eyes
Youre just too good
To be true
And I dont sympathize with those
Who crawl home to you
Your head is on the line you find no other love
And I would go through hell for you
Tell me will you ever let me in
Tell me will you ever let me inIm not the one in search of friction
Im not the one to look for fights
When it gets down to me and you
I think it over twice
We sing the same song
With it all subject to change
There is another place in time girl
You and I will meet again
I saw the signs I never knew
Didnt have enough on you to follow through
Call it innocent or guilty
Inside you its still me
Chorus
Oh whose word you gonna take
Whose heart you gonna break
Not mine
If I believe your true confessions
Im never gonna make it
You know you hurt me for the very last time
I need you darlin and it tears me apart
And if someone comes between us
Its the death of my heart
I think about you and I paint a picture
You wanna love above the law
And you got a taste for adventure
Its what youre livin for
We say the same lies
Anyone to crucify
Were the victims of the same sensations
I can be as bad as you
I step aside you can understand
I wont stand in the way but I will if I can
Not to be your judge and jury
Its still you inside me
Chorus
My gun is loaded and Im ready for war
I come and get you and I kick down the door
Theres no way I cant let you leave
Im not working for the enemySensuality

Each night before we go to sleep
I know that Im in trouble deep
Too many lovers and one aint enough
It seems you got the better of me
You close your eyes
I lie awake
With every breath my body aches
I am a slave
Caught in your evil spell
And I know I could love you very well
Yes I know I could love you very well
Me Touching you
You touching me
Iv never fall for any apparition
We got a love that never breaks
Get up high
Somebody there beside you
Ohh ohhh
Someday I will find your the center of your universe
I thirst and hunger for you body worship
Someday I will find your sensuality
And you will give it back to me
Again inside love
Come to my corner tonight
And Ill love you till the day I die
Each night this love could crucify
only you could sanctify
Youre my religion
Your faith is my church
Girl I will be faithful to you
Show me the sign
Say it is true
No one else can break me like you do
theres no escape
But only time will time
But I know I could love you very well
Yes I know I could love you very well
Me Touching you
You touching me
Im never far from your infatuation
We got a lonely place love

Look down inside love
Come to my corner tonight
And Ill love you till the day I dieCryin in the streets
They run for their lives
How can you lead them to heaven
They dont realize
Children of the night
How far can we fall
That which we say is forever
Aint no time at all
Father and the son
Not too young to be old
Reach out for each other when
The world goes cold
Feel so good to be home
Are you ready for
Chorus
My high civilization
Are you ready for
My high civilization
Are you ready for
My high civilization
Civilization
Everything for us to see
The ultimate society
Keeper of the sword
You fight for your rights
How can you live for the hour
When theres no yesterday
Dyin in the streets
Your number your name
All that which keeps us together
Is bringing us the pain
Thunder of the guns
Comes the criminal mind
Working for the power of
The evil eye
We are never alone
Uncivilized
Chorus
New York Paris Tokyo
Vienna to Berlin
Baby dont know you
LA Rome Afghanistan
Cairo to Iran
No city can hold you
Theres no one in Avalon to show you
Minutes into seconds are you ready
For the end
ChorusOoh ooh
Youre crossing the water
for eastern delights
cause now that youre gone
I feel like a stranger
in New York tonight
And the rhythm was new to me
Tokyo nights
Well she came in the night
and she came in the night
And the vision was true to me
Tokyo nights
Well she came for the moment
and stayed till the end
Ooh wee ah
Take me to Tokyo
Ooh wee ah
Take me to Tokyo
I was lonely in western days
Tokyo nights
Well she took me away
by saving life
I was down in the rising sun
Tokyo nights
Well I came for the moment and
stayed till the end
Ooh wee ah
Take me to Tokyo
Ooh wee ah
Take me to TokyoOh
Youre living your life
In somebody elses heart
My love is as strong
As oceans are far apart
A summer song
Keeps playing in my brain
And I feel you
And I see your face again
Theres no escape
I lost everything
In losing you
Ah I wish you were here
Drying these tears I cry
They were good times
And I wish you were here
And calling my name
But youre dealing with a man insane the cost
How hopelessly Im lost
I tried to throw our love away
And I cant let go
And so I awake
In somebody elses dream
Its not what it seems
Its only a lie
Ive yet to decide whos real
The blood red rose will never never die
Itll burn like a flame
In the dark of the night
Im not afraid
Id give everything
If you hear me there
Ah I wish you were here
Drying these tears I cry
They were good times
Its that time of year
For being alone
But youre dealing with a heart of stone
Try to kiss and say goodbye
Try to throw our love away
And that storm will blow
Oh Wish you were here
Oh Wish you were here
Cause youre dealing with a heart of stone
Try to kiss and say goodbye
Try to throw our love away
And I cant let go
They were good times
And I wish you were here
Yes I wish you were hereYoure gonna fix my heart youre gonna free my soul
Not many learn what the two of us can do or what we do it for
Im gonna sign my name Im gonna join your club
You give me love and theres two of us to feel
Just say the word and Im giving my love to you
You got me backtafunk and Im still turning
Got me backtafunk and Im still turning
You got me backtafunk I cant explain no alibi
The rhythm got me paralyzed you got me
You call it deja vu of being there before
So many lose what the few of us can find
And never mention
Youre gonna break my will
Youre gonna take me down
So many pay when the two of us can steal
So give me what I want and I could be a king for you
You got me backtafunk and Im still turning
Got me backtafunk and Im still turning
You got me backtafunk I was so disorganized
Rhythm cut me down to size you got me
Help me Im in trouble deep as high as I can go its no crime
There may be love on the street and Im bad enough
You got me drowning in my sleep but I will find you when I wake and its time
You got me
Backtafunk to back Repeat 
Backtafunk oh oh Im still turning
Backtafunk oh oh Im still burningDark is the night
High is the fire
Touches the sky
Love with no shape or form
I am in your minds eye
Just let your dreams run wildTake one breath one fundamental sign of life
Dont look back dont analyze the tears you cry
Only the strong survive the silent sacrifice
And I I will be your heart of steel but power has a price
Aint it time that you believe in someone
Aint it wrong to let the years go by
Standing face to face forever live or die
Hold me like a child Im not alive until you do
What you hold in your hand is a miracle
And its dead if I dont have you
Hold me like a child and swear you never let me go
Youre the eye of the storm the reason I laugh or cry
Live or die I will stay with you
Take one breath one fundamental sign of life
No bad blood no pain can make you draw the knife
Ah We got a world of trouble but I will never change
And even if we fall tomorrow we will rise again
Now is the time we show each other these are the words I kept inside
Standing face to face forever live of die
Hold me like a child Im not alive until you do
What you hold in your hand is a miracle
And its dead if I dont have you
Hold me like a child and swear you never let me go
Youre the eye of the storm the reason I laugh or cry
Live or die I will stay with you
Live or die I will stay with you
Take one breath one fundamental sign of life
Dont look back we love each other live or die
Hold me like a child Im not alive until you do
Live or die I will stay with you
Take one breath one fundamental sign of life
Dont look back we love each other live or die
Hold me like a child
Take one breath one fundamental sign of life
Dont look back we love each other live or die
Hold me like a child
Take one breath one fundamental sign of life
Dont look back we love each other live or die
Hold me like a child
Take one breath one fundamental sign of life
Dont look back we love each other live or dieAngela Im still alive
Angela Im still alive
The sun and the sea
The darkness in the way
All the pain dont get no better
It gets stronger every day
It happens to be true
That I still pray to you my love
Voices in the night dont help
My searching for the truth my love
And when Im lost
And high above the storm
I hear your name
Im empty inside Im empty inside
And where are you
Angela Im still alive
For the two of us
Im still alive
Youve got to imagine us
All the world was on our side
We had the power of the universe
And we were ready
We were ready for the ride
Moonlight in her hair
Her eyes the wonder of the age
But all I mean to you my love
Is just a spotlight on an empty stage
And through it all
One fire in the rain
Keeps burning on keeps burning on
I cant stop my heart
Its beating for you
Reaching for you
But you are gone
Im empty inside Im empty inside
And where are you
Angela Im still alive
For the two of us
Im still alive
Angela Im still alive
Angela Im still alive
Angela Im still aliveOh oh oh oh oh oh

You dont know but the word is out
I go crazy for your love

I know I know I know oh oh oh oh
I cant sleep cant sleep I turn the television on
its your face that I see on the screen replacing all the other ones
Im so blind that every girl I see reminds me that I need to be in your arms
the place is here and now the brain is past controlling and the soul is crying
You dont know but the word is out
I go crazy for your love
I breakdown to the ground and I gotta shout
I go crazy for your love
I go crazy for your fingers up and down my spine
come a little closer baby you will find lips all ready to burn
dont need a doctor when Im almost dying
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
never get enough Im crazy for your love
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
never get enough Im crazy
Lips all ready to burn
dont need a doctor when Im almost dying
Gotta keep trying
You dont know but youre number one
I go crazy for your love
You give me feelings that I couldnt get from anyone
I go crazy for your love
You dont know but the word is out
I go crazy for your loveTake me to your world of wonder
Let me come inside your room
Invisible
Now you see nothin
Some investigation as to the state of us
No misunderstanding girl
On either side
I couldnt lie if I try any other way
I cant stop thinking of that girl of mine
Im for the rise and the fall
Any other way and
Chorus
Oh
Ride on my ghost train
Oh
You shouldnt do it you shouldnt do it
Oh
Ride on my ghost train
Oh
Who can stop your past from rushing by
Born to live one million stories high
Into the night
Into the day
Take me to a town or country
Stranger in a strange land
And Im an alien
No you cant find me
You be there at the station
When the train arrives
When it leaves I get my hands on you
I fool myself if I turn any other way
I still keep searchin for that girl of mine
Im for the hell of it all
Do it anyway and
Oh
Ride on my ghost train
Oh
Hearts can break and hearts can
Turn the tide
All is love and love is open wide
Ghost train
Ghost train
Into the night
Into the dayLovers in ancient times
Now it begins -- I see it in your eyes
And I know how you feel -- you long to touch the sky
The flame of life let it eat your heart out every night
But youre not alone
This is your world -- this is your world
Lovers in ancient time caught in the fire
Only the strong survive -- how can we face tomorrow
Live an illusion dont let it fade and die
Something deep inside you a wing and a prayer will guide you
Something deep inside you
Something deep inside you a wing and a prayer will guide you
Something deep inside you
Spoken
Go now girl dont look back This is your one big chance
I place my fingers to your lips and I tell you my love flies with you
On a wing and a prayer on a wing and a prayer
No muscle and bone -- rhythm is the key
Theres everything to play for -- youre everything to me
The game of life -- win it and your love comes tumbling down
Youll never be alone
This is your world -- this is your world
This is your world -- this is your world
Lovers in ancient time caught in the fire
Only the strong survive -- how can we face tomorrow
Live an illusion dont let it fade and die
Something deep inside you a wing and a prayer will guide you
Something deep inside you
Something deep inside you a wing and a prayer will guide you
Something deep inside you
Something deep inside you a wing and a prayer will guide you
Something deep inside youTherell be one small light all over the world tonight
The search will go on for the one
It was love with no name
And we glowed in the sun
There was one small dream
Incredible highs and lows
What little we knew living ordinary lives lives
Made a dream for you living ordinary lives lives
Ordinary people living ordinary lives
Ordinary people living ordinary lives
We were ordinary people living ordinary lives
We were ordinary people living ordinary lives
The clock on the wall keeps moving
Time stands still
No matter how the dice may fall
Someone else always gets to call the number
Say goodbye cruel world
No pity no pain tonight
Whatever the cost all is lost
If this is love with no name
Then its all in the stars
Whether its wrong wrong or right
Theres no one to blame no no lies
What else could we do
Living ordinary lives lives
Made a dream for you
Living ordinary lives lives
Oh oh We were ordinary people living ordinary lives
We were ordinary people living ordinary lives
We were ordinary people
What else could we do
Living ordinary lives lives
Made a dream for you
Living ordinary lives lives
Oh oh We were ordinary people living ordinary lives
We were ordinary people living ordinary lives
We were ordinary people living ordinary lives
We were ordinary people living ordinary livesSomething that I hunger for something you deny
You say Im bad for you and baby so do I
Dont you know that all you gotta do
You could be a lover and baby this is
This is your life
Dont break it its who you do it for
Its the pain and pleasure
This is your life
Temptation a victim of the law
We can talk about it
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
This is your life
This is your life
If you try to help someone you get the evil eye
You say you suffocate well baby so do I
Dont you know that all you gotta do
You could be a lover and baby this is
This is your life
Dont hide it dont try to mystify how soft the flesh is
This is your life
Get even even if you die dont run for cover
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
This is your life
Temptation thats who you do it for
Its the pain and the pleasure
This is your life
Temptation a victim of the law
We can talk about it
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
This is your life
All work and no play I wont survive
Late at night I need your company
What about me what about you
This is your life
Define ourselves as something in space
Not enough for everyone everyone and as we speak
The enemy is the mind
I see the future coming for you
All the lonely days and the lonely nights
Youve been searching for a love so right
Its a tragedy just stayin alive stayin alive
And all that
Jive talking what you doing on your back
Jive talking more rap less crap
Times are bad money is tight
Aint too much heaven on a Saturday night
Tell me now how deep is your love
The heart is soft but the brain is tough
The enemy is the mind dont let the future fall apart
This is my world too just run to me
If you ever want to mend that broken heart
I have seen those nights on Broadway too
Blaming it all what about you
This is your life
This is your life
Dont break it its who you do it for
Its the pain and pleasure
This is your life
Dont hide it dont try to mystify how soft the flesh is
This is your life
Temptation
This is your lifeOne two
Theres a young girl lost on the edge of town
Dont see no future its blind
Dont give up when youre upside down
You just keep it inside
You know we all cry when were alone
Someone like you
And the promise that we wont be
Giving up the ghost
Giving up the ghost
Never you and I
Giving up the ghost
Giving up the ghost
We can never stop
Giving up the ghost
Dont be a hero in the name of love
Dont leave me waiting in line
No ties that bind no ball and chain
The ghost is waiting outside
Im searching so high
Im searching low
Someone like you
Baby Im not
Giving up the ghost
Giving up the ghost
Never you and I
Giving up the ghost
Giving up the ghost
We can never stop
Giving up the ghost
You know we all cry when we are alone
Someone like you we know oh
Im searching so high
Im searching low
Someone like you
We know oh oh oh
Giving up the ghost
Giving up the ghost
Never you and I
Giving up the ghost
Giving up the ghostThough I know its time to take you home
Baby you and I are all alone
We could take a moment of our own
And look what weve got
You could destroy this heart of mine
Im only trying to get by
Hiding in the shadows of the night
Holding you and knowing the wrong is right
Show me some mercy
You know what youre doing is making me a happy man
I shield you from the rain
Ive been slow to get you but Im working as hard as I can
This time its what we believe is true
And whether you believe Im in love with you
I gotta be sure that you say what you mean
Is it only a dream to a teenage queen
And all the years of tears and laughter
We could go through
Will it be happy ever after
For me and you Ooh Ah
Heaven is a place inside of me
Living with your heart as company
Only you can change the way I feel
And make it feel good
Where there is love there is no crime
Im only trying to get mine
Let me be the one to dry your eyes
We can be the promise that never dies
Light of an angel
Blinded by the vision Im wishing we could travel on
Stay with me baby
Any less than an hour you be leaving me lonely too long
This time its what we believe is true
And whether you believe Im in love with you
I gotta be sure that you say what you mean
Is it only a dream to a teenage queen
And you define the dream youre after
Make it come true
Will it be happy ever after
Will it be happy ever after
For me and youI started out to be the man behind the scenes
Knowing I was in above my head
For all that I could see I never saw the truth
Now Im alone
Heaven only knows how much Im missing you
Knowing I had heaven in my hands
And there will be tears
Tears are mixed with rain
Keeper of my flame
Time and tide is on my side
It stands forever
There will be nights of love
And yes there will be tears
I will not sleep tonight
There will be tears tonight
I will not sleep tonight
There will be tears
The silent telephone the turning of the key
Youre still inside of me Im not ashamed
For all that I can do I cant forget your face
I call your name
Heaven only knows what Ive been crying for
What Im crying for
And all Ive done to keep this love alive
Even through my tears
Tears are mixed with rain
Keeper of my flame
I will pray youre on my side
We stand forever
There will be nights of love
And yes there will be tears
I will not sleep tonight oh oh
There will be tears tonight
I will not sleep tonight oh
There will be
Soon there will be tears
Rolling down my world
Keeper of my flame
Time and tide is on my side
It stands forever
There will be nights of love
And yes there will be tears
I will not sleep tonight
There will be tears tonight
I will not sleep tonight
There will be tearsStormy nights Ive been waiting
Satisfy you oh yeah
But his love is just a game
And hes sellng you the same old lies
And Im hangin on the wire
And no closer to the fire
And you dont hear me when I cry
Chorus
You may need someone to lean upon
When hes gone when hes gone
And what is left is a love so strong
When hes gone when hes gone
You wouldnt believe to what extent
My mind is going to
You wouldnt deny me in your dreams
You couldnt belong to someone else
If you could see me now
And Id be the only one
When hes gone
My understanding that you remember
For whom the bell tolls oh yeah
I swear to you I pray
That you feel the battle rage
For the saving of my soul
And its a struggle to survive
You know its keepin us alive
And baby I dont wanna die
Chorus
I will be someone you lean upon
When hes gone when hes gone
And what is left is a love so strong
When hes gone when hes gone
I will be someone you lean upon
When hes gone when hes gone
Dont tell me its too late
And your love dont make me wait
I can see the end of time
With a love that makes you mine
And tonight I let you know
Theres a love that wont let goI see she
Knowing what I came here for
Get a little of your womanifestation
If I can pinpoint this feeling
When you gonna let it grow
We can draw the line on where we
Let the fingers go
Now I know me
Never wanna lose control
Making me the subject
Of your warm initiation
If I can pinpoint this feeling
When you gonna let it show
You make me nervous but its now or never
Oh Oh
You can be my message from above
And its time to say youre sorry
We can sanctify our love
Oh no
And you and I were written in the wind
You cant just go movin out
You cant leave me when Im movin in
I want to be your human sacrifice
I want to be your lover
I want to be your human sacrifice
I want to be your lover
Its you or me
Gotta be a kill or cure
Maybe undergo a lovers operation
Nothing cuts like a knife can
You dont wanna hurt me more
Look at all that damage
We could do together
Oh no
You can wear me closer to the bone
It dont work to make me worry
But the demon seed is sown
Oh no
And you and I were written in the sky
You cant make me hold on
Better you shoot my love between the eyes
Your eyes on me on this table where I lie
And what I see as fact is fiction
You wont let me die
And Im bound to be abused
I wont let you cut me loose
This love is out to get you
When the blood begins to flowDont get too close to me
Dont overreact
Youre not the enemy as a matter of fact
You got your pretty face and you got any name you wore
Gonna stick by you gonna stumble over what to do
I want it good lovin want to be your plaything
I want it good lovin bring out the beast in me
I want it good lovin want to make your heart sing
In the shadows we are free and I walk you through it
Its my neighborhood
Thats where I belong
Youre in trouble if you
Disagree with me
Its my neighborhood
Thats where I belong
You find out why
Its my neighborhood
Thats where I belong
Youre in trouble if you
Disagree with me
Its my neighborhood
Thats where I belong
You find out why
So many tell you that you cant win
Its a battle if youre lonely
Or if youre starting over
Two-fisted and fast on your feet
And you know theres something more
And the city kicks it out of you and
I want it good lovin want to be your plaything
I want it good lovin bring out the worst in me
I want it good lovin want to make your heart sing
In the shadows we are free and I walk you through it
Its my neighborhood
Thats where I belong
Youre in trouble if you
Disagree with me
Its my neighborhood
Thats where I belong
You find out why
