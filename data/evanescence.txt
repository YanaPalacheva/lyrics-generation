Im so tired of being here
Suppressed by all my childish fears
And if you have to leave
I wish that you would just leave
Cause your presence still lingers here
And it wont leave me alone
These wounds wont seem to heal this pain is just too real
Theres just too much that time cannot erase
When you cried Id wipe away all of your tears
When youd scream Id fight away all of your fears
And I held your hand through all of these years
But you still have all of me
You used to captivate me by your resonating light
Now Im bound by the life you left behind
Your face it haunts my once pleasant dreams
Your voice it chased away all the sanity in me
These wounds wont seem to heal this pain is just too real
Theres just too much that time cannot erase
When you cried Id wipe away all of your tears
When youd scream Id fight away all of your fears
And I held your hand through all of these years
But you still have all of me
Ive tried so hard to tell myself that youre gone
But though youre still with me Ive been alone all along
When you cried Id wipe away all of your tears
When youd scream Id fight away all of your fears
And I held your hand through all of these years
You still have all of me me meCigarette Lit
My Plans to Quit
And I know I can but I know I will forget it
Stuck here I need something quick
Jus to stop me thinking
Always loud always in
Jus come in to me
Excuse me please what have you got
Get me out of my head while Ive still got the courage
But not so out just out enough till I feel like Im takin off
The rain falls down Im not alone
Covers all of us in silver line silver line
And all I beg you stay with me
Let it rain all night
What a gift this short visit
And I know Ill go just as quick as I came in
Night stick my finger tips
Jus stop me thinking
Always out always in
Oh jus come in to me
Excuse me please what have you got
Get me out of my head while Ive still got the courage
Not so out just out enough till I feel like Im takin off
And the rain fall down Im so alone
And covered all of us with silver line in silver line
And all I beg you stay with me
Let it rain all night
Im always out always in
Jus come in to me
Not so out just out enough till I feel like Im takin off
And the rain falls down Im not alone
And covers all of us in silver line in silver line
And all I beg you stay with me
Let it rain all night oh oh
And the rain falls down Im not alone
It covers up in a silver line in silver line
And all I beg you stay with me
Let it rain all nightI sense theres something in the wind
That feels like tragedys at hand
And though Id like to stand by him
Cant shake this feeling that I have
The worst is just around the bend
And does he notice my feelings for him
And will he see how much he means to me
I think its not to be
What will become of my dear friend
Where will his actions lead us then
Although Id like to join the crowd
In their enthusiastic cloud
Try as I may it doesnt last
And will we ever end up together
No I think not its never to become
For I am not the one
And will we ever end up together
OhhhhhhhCatch me as I fall
Say youre here and its all over now
Speaking to the atmosphere
No ones here and I fall into myself
This truth drives me
Into madness
I know I can stop the pain
If I will it all away
Dont turn away
Dont give in to the pain
Dont try to hide
Though theyre screaming your name
Dont close your eyes
God knows what lies behind them
Dont turn out the light
Never sleep never die
Im frightened by what I see
But somehow I know
That theres much more to come
Immobilized by my fear
And soon to be
Blinded by tears
I can stop the pain
If I will it all away
Dont turn away
Dont give in to the pain
Dont try to hide
Though theyre screaming your name
Dont close your eyes
God knows what lies behind them
Dont turn out the light
Never sleep never die
Fallen angels at my feet
Whispered voices at my ear
Death before my eyes
Lying next to me I fear
She beckons me
Shall I give in
Upon my end shall I begin
Forsaking all Ive fallen for
I rise to meet my end
Dont turn away
Dont give in to the pain
Dont try to hide
Though theyre screaming your name
Dont close your eyes
God knows what lies behind them
Dont turn out the light
Never sleep never die
Dont turn away
Dont give in to the pain
Dont try to hide
Though theyre screaming your name
Dont close your eyes
God knows what lies behind them
Dont turn out the light
Never sleep never die
Dont turn away
Dont give in to the pain
Dont try to hide
Though theyre screaming your name
Dont close your eyes
God knows what lies behind them
Dont turn out the light
Never sleep never dieLong lost words whisper slowly to me
Still cant find what keeps me here
When all this time Ive been so hollow inside
I know youre still there
Watching me wanting me
I can feel you pull me down
Fearing you loving you
I wont let you pull me down
Hunting you I can smell you - alive
Your heart pounding in my head
Watching me wanting me
I can feel you pull me down
Saving me raping me
Watching meIm so tired of being here
Suppressed by all my childish fears
And if you have to leave
I wish that you would just leave
Cause your presence still lingers here
And it wont leave me alone

Perfect by nature
I come from self indulgence
Just what we all need
More lies about a world that
Never was and never will be
Have you no shame Dont you see me
You know youve got everybody fooled
Look here she comes now
Bow down and stare in wonder
Oh how we love you
No flaws when youre pretending
But now I know she
Never was and never will be
You dont know how youve betrayed me
And somehow youve got everybody fooled
Without the mask where will you hide
Cant find yourself lost in your lie
I know the truth now
I know who you are
And I dont love you anymore
It Never was and never will be
You dont know how youve betrayed me
And somehow youve got everybody fooled
It never was and never will be
Youre not real and you cant save me
Somehow now youre everybodys foolYou dont remember me but I remember you
I lie awake and try so hard not to think of you
But who can decide what they dream
And dream I do
I believe in you
Ill give up everything just to find you
I have to be with you to live to breathe
Youre taking over me
Have you forgotten all I know
And all we had
You saw me mourning my love for you
And touched my hand
I knew you loved me then
I believe in you
Ill give up everything just to find you
I have to be with you to live to breathe
Youre taking over me
I look in the mirror and see your face
If I look deep enough
So many things inside that are just like you are taking over
I believe in you
Ill give up everything just to find you
I have to be with you to live to breathe
Youre taking over me
I believe in you
Ill give up everything just to find you
I have to be with you to live to breathe
Youre taking over me
Youre taking over meIve been looking in the mirror for so long
That Ive come to believe my souls on the other side
All the little pieces falling shatter
Shards of me
Too sharp to put back together
Too small to matter
But big enough to cut me into so many little pieces
If I try to touch her
And I bleed
I bleed
And I breathe
I breathe no more
Take a breath and I try to draw from my spirits well
Yet again you refuse to drink like a stubborn child
Lie to me
Convince me that Ive been sick forever
And all of this
Will make sense when I get better
but I know the difference
Between myself and my reflection
I just cant help but to wonder
Which of us do you love
So I bleed
I bleed
And I breathe
I breathe no
Bleed
I bleed
And I breathe
I breathe
I breathe
I breathe no moreI linger in the doorway
Of alarm clock screaming monsters calling my name
Let me stay
Where the wind will whisper to me
Where the raindrops as theyre falling tell a story
In my field of paper flowers
And candy clouds of lullaby
I lie inside myself for hours
And watch my purple sky fly over me
Dont say Im out of touch
With this rampant chaos your reality
I know well what lies beyond my sleeping refuge
The nightmare I built my own world to escape
In my field of paper flowers
And candy clouds of lullaby
I lie inside myself for hours
And watch my purple sky fly over meHow can you see into my eyes like open doors
Leading you down into my core
Where Ive become so numb without a soul
My spirits sleeping somewhere cold
Until you find it there and lead it back home
Wake me up wake me up inside I cant wake up
Wake me up inside save me
Call my name and save me from the dark wake me up
Bid my blood to run I cant wake up
Before I come undone save me
Save me from the nothing Ive become
Now that I know what Im without
You cant just leave me
Breathe into me and make me real bring me to life
Wake me up wake me up inside I cant wake up
Wake me up inside save me
Call my name and save me from the dark wake me up
Bid my blood to run I cant wake up
Before I come undone save me
Save me from the nothing Ive become
Bring me to life Ive been living a lie
Theres nothing inside bring me to life
Frozen inside without your touch
Without your love darling
Only you are the life among the dead
All this time I cant believe I couldnt see
Kept in the dark but you were there in front of me
Ive been sleeping a thousand years it seems
Ive got to open my eyes to everything
Without a thought without a voice without a soul
Dont let me die here
There must be something wrong bring me to life
Wake me up wake me up inside I cant wake up
Wake me up inside save me
Call my name and save me from the dark wake me up
Bid my blood to run I cant wake up
Before I come undone save me
Save me from the nothing Ive become
Bring me to life Ive been living a lie theres nothing inside
Bring me to lifePlease please forgive me
But I wont be home again
Maybe someday youll have woke up
And barely conscious youll say to no one
Isnt something missing
You wont cry for my absence I know
You forgot me long ago
Am I that unimportant
Am I so insignificant
Isnt something missing
Isnt someone missing me
Even though Im the sacrifice
You wont try for me not now
Though Id die to know you love me
Im all alone
Isnt someone missing me
Please please forgive me
But I wont be home again
I know what you do to yourself
I breathe deep and cry out
Isnt something missing
Isnt someone missing me
Even though Im the sacrifice
You wont try for me not now
Though Id die to know you love me
Im all alone
Isnt someone missing me
And if I bleed Ill bleed
Knowing you dont care
And if I sleep just to dream of you
And wake without you there
Isnt something missing
Isnt something
Even though Im the sacrifice
You wont try for me not now
Though Id die to know you love me
Im all alone
Isnt someone missing meAll of my hate cannot be bound

Holding my last breath
Safe inside myself

Sweet raptured light
It ends here tonight
Ill miss the winter
A world of fragile things
Look for me in the white forest
Hiding in a hollow tree come find me
I know you hear me
I can taste it in your tears
Holding my last breath
Safe inside myself
Are all my thoughts of you
Sweet raptured light
It ends here tonight
Closing your eyes to disappear
You pray your dreams will leave you here
But still you wake and know the truth -
No ones there

Holding my last breathNobody on the road
Nobody on the beach
I feel it in the air
The summers out of reach
Empty lake empty streets
The sun goes down alone
Im drivin by your house
Though I know youre not at home
But I can see you
Your brown skin shinin in the sun
You got your hair combed back and your sunglasses on baby
And I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone
I never will forget those nights
I wonder if it was a dream
Remember how you made me crazy
Remember how I made you scream
Now I dont understand what happened to our love
But babe Im gonna get you back
Im gonna show you what Im made of
I can see you
Your brown skin shinin in the sun
I see you walkin real slow and youre smilin at everyone
I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone
Out on the road today I saw a BLACK FLAG sticker on a Cadillac
A little voice Inside my head said Dont look back You cannever look back
I thought I knew what love was
What did I know
Those days are gone forever
I should just let them go but
I can see you
Your brown skin shinin in the sun
You got that top pulled down and that radio on baby
And I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone
I can see you
Your brown skin shinin in the sun
You got that hair slicked back and those Wayfarers on baby
I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have goneHow can i pretend that i dont see
what you hide so carelessly
i saw her bleed
you heard me breathe
and i froze inside myself
and turned away
i must be dreaming
We all live
We all die
That does not begin to justify you
Its not what it seems
Not what you think
No I must be dreaming
Its only in my mind
Not real life
No I must be dreaming
Help you know ive got to tell someone
Tell them what i know youve done
I fear you but spoken fears can come true
We all live

That does not begin to justify you
Its not what it seems
Not what you think
No I must be dreaming
Its only in my mind
Not real life
No I must be dreaming

Oh sim sim
Eu s estou tentando compreender
O que h de errado com sua cabea
Toda vez que eu olho em volta
Voc est em outro lugar
Eu quero te perguntar por que
Mas toda vez que eu tento voc chora
CHORUS
E eu quero que voc saiba
Quando voc est viajando no espao
E eu quero que voc saiba
Se voc ir voltar aqui pra baixo
E eu preciso que voc saiba
Eu quero te respirar eu quero te sentir perto
Esta minha confisso
Eu quero ver o que voc v quando voc chora essas lgrimas

O que sou eu para fazer
Talvez seja minha obsesso mas
Essa minha confisso
Eu confesso
Toda vez que eu estou por perto
Algo sempre a deprime
E eu no entendo por que
Mas se voc quiser me dizer
Eu serei o anjo da guarda baby
Eu serei o homem que voc confia
Mas eu no posso parecer correr
Eu te pego fora desse lugar
Porque tudo o que voc faz s
Apagar minha dor
O dio est dentro
Eu eu no posso perguntar por que
CHORUS at acabarOriginally by The Offspring
I wrote her off for the tenth time today
And practiced all the things I would say
But she came over
I lost my nerve
I took her back and made her desverve
Now I know Im being used
Thats okay man cause I like the abuse
I know shes playing with me
Thats okay cause Ive got no self esteem
oh yeah yeah yeah
We make plans to go out at night
I wait till two then I turn out the light
All this rejections got me so low
If she keeps it up I just might tell her so
When shes saying all that she wants only me
Then I wonder why she sleeps with my friends
When shes saying all that Im like a disease
Then I wonder how much more I can spend
Well I guess I should stick up for myself
But I really think its better this way
The more you suffer
The more it shows you really care Right Yeah
Now Ill relate this little bit
That happens more than Id like to admit
Late at night she knocks on my door
Shes Drunk again and looking to score
Now I know I should say no
But thats kind of hard when shes ready to go
I may be dumb but Im not a dweeb
Im just a sucker with no self esteem
oh yeah yeah yeah
When shes saying all that she wants only me
Then I wonder why she sleeps with my friends
When shes saying all that Im like a disease
Then I wonder how much more I can spend
Well I guess I should stick up for myself
But I really think its better this way
The more you suffer
The more it shows you really care Right YeahI will wander til the end of time torn away from you
I pull away to face the pain
I close my eyes and drift away
Over the fear that I will never find
A way to heal my soul
And I will wander til the end of time
Torn away from you
My heart is broken
Sweet sleep my dark angel
Deliver us from sorrows hold
Or from my hard heart
I cant go on living this way
And I cant go back the way I came
Shamed of this fear that I will never find
A way to heal my soul
And I will wander til the end of time
Half a life without you
My heart is broken
Sweet sleep my dark angel
Deliver us change open your eyes to the light
I denied it all so long oh so long
Say goodbye goodbye
My heart is broken
Release me I cant hold on
Deliver us my heart is broken
Sweet sleep my dark angel
Deliver us my heart is broken
Sweet sleep my dark angel
Deliver us from sorrows holdby Meat Loaf
And i would do anything for love id run right into hell and back
I would do anything for love ill never lie to you and thats a fact
But ill never forget the way you feel right now
- oh no - no way - i would do anything for love
I would do anything for love threex
But i wont do that no i wont do that
Some days it dont come easy some days it dont come hard
Some days it dont come at all and these are the days that never end
Some nights you breath fire some nights your carved in ice
Some nights youre like nothing ive ever seen before or will again
Maybe im crazy but its crazy and its true
I know you can save me no one else can save me now but you
As long as the planets are turning as long as the stars are burning
As long as your dreams are coming true - you better believe it
That i would do anything for love threex
But i wont do that i wont do that
I would do anything for love
Anything youve been dreaming of
But i just wont do that
Some days i pray for silence some days i pray for soul
Some days i just pray to the god of sex and drums and rock n roll
Maybe im lonely and thats all im qualified to be
Theres just one and only the one and only promise i can keep
As long as the wheels are turning as long as the fires are burning
As long as your prayers are coming true - you better believe it
That i would do anything for love
And you know its true and thats a fact i would do anything for love
And therell never be no turning back
But ill never do it better than i do it with you
So long so long - i would do anything for love threex
But i wont do that i wont do that
Girl will you raise me up will you help me down
Will you help get me right out of this godforsaken town
Will you make it a little less cold
Boy i can do that i can do that
Girl will you cater to every fantasy that ive got
Will ya hose me down with holy water - if i get too hot
Will you take me to places that ive never known
Boy i can do that i can do that
Girl i know the territory ive been around
Itll all turn to dust and well all fall down
And sooner or later youll be screwing around
Boy i wont do that i wont do that
Anything for love but i wont do thatOriginally by Garbage
Im only happy when it rains
Im only happy when its complicated
And though I know you cant appreciate it
Im only happy when it rains
You know I love it when the news is bad
And why it feels so good to feel so sad
Im only happy when it rains
Pour your misery down pour your misery down on me
Pour your misery down pour your misery down on me
Im only happy when it rains
I feel good when things are going wrong
I only listen to the sad sad songs
Im only happy when it rains
I only smile in the dark
My only comfort is the night gone black
I didnt accidentally tell you that
Im only happy when it rains
Youll get the message by the time Im through
When I complain about me and you
Im only happy when it rains
Pour your misery down Pour your misery down
Pour your misery down on me Pour your misery down
Pour your misery down Pour your misery down
Pour your misery down on me Pour your misery down
Pour your misery down Pour your misery down
Pour your misery down on me Pour your misery down
Pour your misery down
You can keep me company
As long as you dont care
Im only happy when it rains
You wanna hear about my new obsession
Im riding high upon a deep depression
Im only happy when it rains Pour some misery down on me
Im only happy when it rains Pour some misery down on me
Im only happy when it rains Pour some misery down on me
Im only happy when it rains Pour some misery down on me
Im only happy when it rains Pour some misery down on meMetaphor for a missing moment
Pull me into your perfect circle
One womb
One shame
One resolve
Liberate this will
To release us all
Gotta cut away clear away
Slip away and sever this
Umbilical residue thats
Keeping me from killing you
And from pulling you down with me in here
I can almost hear you scream
One more medicated peaceful moment
Give me
One more medicated peaceful moment
And I dont wanna feel this overwhelming
Hostility
I dont wanna feel this overwhelming
Hostility
We gotta cut away clear away
Slip away and sever this
Umbilical residue
Gotta cut away clear away
Slip away and sever this
Umbilical residue thats
Keeping me from killing you
Slip away and sever this
Keeping me from killing youMy reflection dirty mirror
Theres no connection to myself
Im your lover Im your zero
Im the face in your dreams of glass
So save your prayers
For when youre really gonna need em
Throw out your cares and fly
Wanna go for a ride
Shes the one for me
Shes all I really need
Cause shes the one for me
Emptiness is loneliness
And loneliness is cleanliness
And cleanliness is godliness
And God is empty just like me
Intoxicated with the madness
Im in love with my sadness
Bullshit fakers enchanted kingdoms
The fashion victims chew their charcoal teeth
I never let on
That I was on a sinking ship
I never let on that I was down
You blame yourself
For what you cant ignore
You blame yourself for wanting more
Shes the one for me
Shes all I really need
Oh yes shes the one for me
Shes my one and onlyYou hold the answers deep within your own mind
Consciously youve forgotten it
Thats the way the human mind works
Whenever something is too unpleasant too shameful for us
to entertain we reject it
We erase it from our memories
But the IMPRINT is always there
Cant wash it all away
Cant Wish it all away
Cant hope it all away
Cant cry it all away
The pain that grips you
The fear that binds you
Releases life in me
In our mutual
Shame we hide our eyes
To blind them from the truth
That finds a way from who we are
Please dont be afraid
When the darkness fades away
The dawn will break the silence
Screaming in our hearts
My love for you still grows
This I do for you
Before I try to fight the truth
my final time
Were supposed to try and be real
And I feel alone and were not together And that is real
Cant wash it all away
Cant wish it all away
Cant cry it all away
Cant scratch it all away
Lying beside you
Listening to you breathe
The life that flows inside of you
Burns inside of me
Hold and speak to me
Of love without a sound
Tell me you will live through this
And I will die for you
Cast me not away
Say youll be with me
For I know I cannot
Bear it all alone
Youre not alone are you
Never Never
Cant fight it all away
Cant hope it all away
Cant scream it all away
It just wont fade away No
Cant wash it all away
Cant wish it all away
Cant cry it all away
Cant scratch it all away
Cant fight it all away
Cant hope it all away
Cant scream it all away
Ooh it all away
Ooh it all away
But the answer is always there Nothing is ever really forgotten
Please dont hate me
Cause Id die if you do
Cause Id die if you do
Cause Id die if you do
Cause Id die if you doShe embraced
With a smile
As she opened the door
A cold wind blows
It puts a chill
Into my heart
You have taken away the trust
Youre the ghost haunting through her heart
Past and present are one in her head
Youre the ghost haunting through her heart
Take my hand as I wander through
All of my life I gave to you
Take my hand as I wander through
All of my love I gave to you

When we watch cartoon cartoons Im happy as can be
I think samurai Jack is cool And Dexters laboratory
I miss watching power puff I miss watching TV
Well livin on the tour bus aint that bad
But I feel like I lost all that I have
On Cartoon Network I miss you so
On Cartoon Network where did you go
Grim and evil how I love that little brain
Johnny Bravo can I smack you once again
I hope youve learned a lesson here
Treasure what you have dont make the mistake I made
The rockstar life is sad
Well livin on the tour bus is pretty bad
And now Im sure I know the meanin of my life
The love within my soul
The reason I wake up each day and its
Cartoon Network I miss you so
My Cartoon Network where did you go
My Cartoon NetworkI dont want to say goodbye
I can see the fear inside your eyes
Its so hard to walk away
I know that this feels like the end
Life never seems to let you win
But Ill be back someday
Im already missing you
But Im not even gone
In time well be together again
And it wont be long
Now everything goes up and down
And the world keeps spinning round and round
And still youre waiting there
Ill try to make it another night
And dream of you when I close my eyes
Cause Ill be back someday
Im already missing you
But Im not even gone
In time well be together again
And it wont be long
Just hold it in
Dont let it go
Youll always live
Inside my soulWalkin around two hundred and forty-seven
waiting for you to arise
from your deadly grave
firey flames blowing in my face
burning through my skin
but how can I help it
forgive me god for I have sinned
Forgive me God
Forgive me god
For I have sinned
Im all wound up in flames
who wants to be an angel
Im hells angel
Hells Angel
Throwing flames up above
killing what I dont shove
I dont have time to be what I really am
knowing it all
catching nothing
nobody cares about me
well nobody really knows me
Im hells angel
rising down below
hating what I dont have
forgive me God
forgive me
for I have sinned
Walkin around two hundred and forty-seven
waiting for you to arise
from your deadly grave
firey flames blowing in my face
burning through my skin
but how can I help it
Its not me its my inner soul
Forgive me
Forgive me
hell raising angel
hell risin angel
Im hells angel

That i have gone down this road
Only to find that it ends
But lookin back
There is one thing that I know
I cant make it all alone again
Cause im too weak to stand on my own
But all I need is you
Chorus
So lead me
Guide me
Hold me
Hide me in love
With all that you are
and all that you do
Hear me
Take me
Mold me
Break me oh God
Just fill all of me
As i fall Into you
Just catch me as I fall
But all this time
I have felt so alone
losing myself in my despair
With loving arms
You were waiting for me to let go
With every step
you were there
Cause Im too weak to stand on my own
When all i need is you
chorus
Oh my child
How i have longed
For you to come home
to where you belong
All of your life
If you could just see
All of my joy
When you are here with me Xtwo
Hear me Take me
mold me
break me oh god
Just fill all of me
as I fall into youWhy do you cry for me
Why do you fake that you dont see me
When you change everybodys path
But you know that
One day you are going to see me with different eyes
CHORUS
I dont know if I will survive without you in my arms
Then now
Give me a chance
Let me show you how much love you
Oh I need you to survive in the darkness
Save me from the dark and from the death
If I die the love that I feel for you will ressucitateme from
The gray of the evil and dark
And the sun will shine for me again yeah
The love is indestructible against the evil
I dream that I have you with me
So tell me why do you cry for me
Come with me you wont regret it
CHORUS
Give me a chance
Let me show you how much I love you
Oh I need you to survive in the darkness
Save me from the death
CHORUS
I dont know if I will survive without you in my arms
Then now
Give me a chance
Let me show you how much I love you
Oh I need you to survive in the darkness
Save me from the dark and from the death
REPEAT CHORUS twoxHow can you see into my eyes like open doors
Leading you down into my core
Where Ive become so numb without a soul
My spirits sleeping somewhere cold
Until you find it there and lead it back home
Wake me up wake me up inside I cant wake up
Wake me up inside save me
Call my name and save me from the dark wake me up
Bid my blood to run I cant wake up
Before I come undone save me
Save me from the nothing Ive become
Now that I know what Im without
You cant just leave me
Breathe into me and make me real bring me to life
Wake me up wake me up inside I cant wake up
Wake me up inside save me
Call my name and save me from the dark wake me up
Bid my blood to run I cant wake up
Before I come undone save me
Save me from the nothing Ive become
Bring me to life Ive been living a lie
Theres nothing inside bring me to life
Frozen inside without your touch
Without your love darling
Only you are the life among the dead
All this time I cant believe I couldnt see
Kept in the dark but you were there in front of me
Ive been sleeping a thousand years it seems
Ive got to open my eyes to everything
Without a thought without a voice without a soul
Dont let me die here
There must be something wrong bring me to life
Wake me up wake me up inside I cant wake up
Wake me up inside save me
Call my name and save me from the dark wake me up
Bid my blood to run I cant wake up
Before I come undone save me
Save me from the nothing Ive become
Bring me to life Ive been living a lie theres nothing inside
Bring me to lifeLong lost words whisper slowly to me
Still cant find what keeps me here
When all this time Ive been so hollow inside
I know youre still there
Watching me wanting me
I can feel you pull me down
Fearing you loving you
I wont let you pull me down
Hunting you I can smell you - alive
Your heart pounding in my head
Watching me wanting me
I can feel you pull me down
Saving me raping me
Watching mePor favor no me preguntes como
acabe con desesperacion y quebrando
paginas rasgadas de libros que nunca leeremos
porque estamos atascados en esta rejilla
no quites el tapon justamente ahora o tendremos que vivir en serio
cuando muera ellos recordaran no lo que hice pero si lo que no he hecho
no es al fin al que le temo con cada respiro es la vida la que me asusta hasta la muerte
cuando construimos estos sueos en la arena
como nos quitaron todo de nuestras manos sin que nos dieramos cuenta
esta podria ser nuestra unica chance
vamos a tomarnos un momento de este dia
sostendr tu mano si tu sostienes la ma
el tiempo que matemos nos mantendra con vida
tus palabras no me salvaran ahora
estoy en el borde sintiendo la gota de sudor desde mi abismo
toma el poder que hay dentro de ti mismo es lo que ellos dicen
cada hora cada dia
manos sobre mis oidos he estado gritando todos estos aos
cuando muera ellos recordaran no lo que hice pero si lo que no he hecho
no es al fin al que le temo con cada respiro es la vida la que me asusta hasta la muerte

esta podria ser nuestra unica chance
vamos a tomarnos un momento de este dia
sostendr tu mano si tu sostienes la ma
el tiempo que matemos nos mantendra con vida
entramos en busca de respuestas
quedamos con las manos vacias otra vez
tiros disparados dentro del cielo estamos volviendo ahora
donde mierda te esconderas
escondiendote de las risas en el closet de nuestras vidas
pero las bisagras de la puerta estan chillando dejando pasar finos rayos de luz
y ahora una mano esta extendida del otro lado a un tranquilo comfort invitan
estamos dispuestos a tomar lo que ofrecen estamos un paso dentro de la luz
cuando muera ellos recordaran no lo que hice pero si lo que no he hecho
no es al fin al que le temo con cada respiro es la vida la que me asusta hasta la muerte
cuando construimos estos sueos en la arena

el tiempo que matemos nos mantendra con vidaEvery time we lie awake
After every hit we take
Every feeling that I get
But I havent missed you yet
Every roommate kept awake
By every sigh and scream we make
All the feelings that I get
But I still dont miss you yet
Only when I stop to think about it
I hate everything about you
Why do I love you
I hate everything about you
Why do I love you
Every time we lie awake
After every hit we take
Every feeling that I get
But I havent missed you yet
Only when I stop to think about it
I hate everything about you
Why do I love you
I hate everything about you
Why do I love you
Only when I stop to think about you
I know
Only when you stop to think about me
Do you know
I hate everything about you
Why do I love you
You hate everything about me
Why do you love me
I hate
You hate
I hate
You love me
I hate everything about you
Why do I love youYou are everything I need to see
Smile and sunlight makes sunlight to me
Laugh and come and look into me
Drips of moonlight washing over me
Can I show you what you are for me
Angel of mine can I thank you
You have saved me time and time again
Angel I must confess
Its you that always gives me strength
And I dont know where Id be without you
After all these years one thing is true
Constant voice within my heart is you
You touch me I feel Im moving into you
I treasure every day I spend with you
All the things I am come down to you
Angel of mine
Let me thank you
You have saved me time and time again
Angel I must confess
Its you that always gives me strength
And I dont know where Id be without you
Back in the arms of my angel
Back to the peace that I so love
Back in the arms of my angel I can finally rest
Giving you a gift that you remind me
Angel of mine
Let me thank you
You have saved me time and time and time and time again
Angel I must confess
Its you that always gives me strength
And I dont know where Id be without you
Angel of mine
Can I thank you
You have saved me time and time again
Angel I must confess
Its you that always gives me strength
And I dont know where Id be without you
without youPerfect by nature icons of self indulgence
Just what we all need
More lies about a world that
Never was and never will be
Have you no shame Dont you see me
You know youve got everybody fooled
Look here she comes now
Bow down and stare in wonder oh how we love you
No flaws when youre pretending but now I know she
Never was and never will be
You dont know how you betrayed me
And somehow youve got everybody fooled
Without the mask where will you hide
Cant find yourself
Lost in your lies
I know the truth and now
I know who you are
And I dont love you anymore
It never was and never will be
You dont know how you betrayed me
And somehow youve got everybody fooled
Never was and never will be
Youre not real and you cant save me
Somehow now youre everybodys foolJealous of the girl who caught your eye
One of my darker days
When you looked at her where was I
Shoulda been in her place
Here I am
All alone imagining what could have been
If I had been there
Chorus
Jealous of the one whose arms are around you
If shes keeping you satisfied
Jealous of the one who finally found you
Made your sun and your stars collide
La la la la la la la
Shes a very very lucky girl
La la la la la la la
Jealous of the one who won your heart
They say its a perfect match
Shes gonna get to be where you are
And I dont get better than that
Shell say youre fine
Whisper words I wish were mine
And they might have been
If I had been there
Repeat Chorus
You know Id fight the good fight
If I thought Id change your mind
But if she makes you happy
I would leave that dream behind
Man she better treat you right
And give you everything
Cause at the moment she doesnt
Ill be waiting in the wings
Repeat Chorus
La la la la la la la
Shes a very very lucky girlStay alive soft dark and dreamless
Far beneath my nightmares and loneliness
I hate me for breathing without you
I dont want to feel anymore for you
Grieving for you Im not grieving for you
Nothing real love cant undo
And though I may have lost my way
All paths lead straight to you
I long to be like you
Lie cold in the ground like you
Halo blinding wall between us
Melt away and leave us alone again
Humming haunted somewhere out there
I believe our love can see us through in death
I long to be like you
Lie cold in the ground like you
Theres room inside for two
And Im not grieving for you
Im coming for you
Youre not alone
No matter what they told you
Youre not alone
Ill be right beside you forevermore
I long to be like you sis
Lie cold in the ground like you did
Theres room inside for two
And Im not grieving for you
And as we lay in silent bliss
I know you remember me
I long to be like you
Lie cold in the ground like you
Theres room inside for two
And Im not grieving for you
Im coming for youI linger in the doorway
Of alarm clock screaming
Monsters calling my name
Let me stay
Where the wind will whisper to me
Where the raindrops
As theyre falling tell a story
In my field of paper flowers
And candy clouds of lullaby
I lie inside myself for hours
And watch my purple sky fly over me
Dont say Im out of touch
With this rampant chaos your reality
I know well what lies beyond my sleeping refuge
The nightmare I build my own world to escape
In my field of paper flowers
And candy clouds of lullaby
I lie inside myself for hours
And watch my purple sky fly over me
Swallowed up in the sound of my screaming
Cannot cease for the fear of silent lies
Oh how I long for the deep sleep dreaming
The goddess of imaginary light
In my field of paper flowers
And candy clouds of lullaby
I lie inside myself for hours
And watch my purple sky fly over meIve spent so much time throwing rocks at your window
That I never even knocked on the front door
I walk by statues never even made one chip
But if I could leave a mark on the monument of the heart
I just might lay myself down for a little more than I had the last day
The last day the last day the last day
Wait a time to spare these lies we tell ourselves
These days have come and gone
But this time is sweeter than honeyMy cells not ringing my doorbell isnt singing
My bed is empty Im fragile all I do is cry
Because he left me and you didnt even want me
Im lost and lonely Cant live without you
You
My cells not ringing my doorbell isnt singing
You
My bed is empty Im fragile all I do is cry
You
Because he loved me and you didnt even want me
You
Im lost and lonely Cant live without you
Chorus
You
Every beat of my heart every day of my life
You
Every thought on my mind
Every second every moment
You
Every still of the night every romance goes right
You
Every dream I deny
Every second every moment
You
Every beat of my heart every day of my life
You
Every thought on my mind
Every second every moment
You
Every tear that I cry every hope in my mind
You
Everything that I hide
Every second every moment
You eightxs
Im hearing footsteps outside my door I get up
A voice is humming a tune thats sounding like goodbye
I know Ill find you no matter where youre hiding
And so I wish for a chance to find you
You
Every beat of my heart every day of my life
You
Every thought on my mind
Every second every moment
You
Every still of the night every romance goes right
You
Every dream I deny
Every second every moment

Every tear that I cry every hope in my mind
You
Everything that I hide
Every second every moment
You
Every beat of my heart every day of my life
You
Every thought on my mind
Every second every moment twelvexs
You sixteenxsWheres the light
Killed my day
Lost in the dark of your ways
Wasted my energy endlessly
On your sweet lie
And if you dont mind
I would like to live the lie
That I will survive
And if you dont mind
I would love to slip away
And leave your world behind
Insecure Im not sure
Youre not just faking something
Wasted our last day
I cant take the pain
And if you dont mind
I would like to live the lie
That I will survive
And If you dont mind
I would love to slip away and leave it all behindNever thought that Id be leaving you today
So alone and wondering why I feel this way
So wide the world
Can love remember how to get me home to you someday
Well be together again
All just a dream in the end
Well be together again
So many fears were swimming around and around in my mind
Who would have dreamed the secrets we would find
Ive found a world where love and dreams and darkness all collide
Maybe this time we can leave our broken world behind
Well be together again
All just a dream in the endI linger in the doorway
Of alarm clock screaming monsters calling my name
Let me stay
Where the wind will whisper to me
Where the raindrops as theyre falling tell a story
In my field of paper flowers
And candy clouds of lullaby
I lie inside myself for hours
And watch my purple sky fly over me
Dont say Im out of touch
With this rampant chaos your reality
I know well what lies beyond my sleeping refuge
The nightmare I built my own world to escape
In my field of paper flowers
And candy clouds of lullaby
I lie inside myself for hours
And watch my purple sky fly over meSave your twisted enemy
So you might earn forgiveness
You know your whole world is waiting
So why cant you speak
I feel it coming over me
Im still a slave to these dreams
Is this the end of everything
Or just a new way to bleed
So go and tell all your friends
That Im a failure underneath
If it makes you feel like a bigger man
But its my my heart my life
That youre calling a lie
Ive played this game before
And I cant take anymore
I feel it coming over me
Im still a slave to these dreams
Is this the end of everything
Or just a new way to bleed
By drifting far beyond the edge
Freedom freedom
Cant you feel the ground caving in
Freedom
Give us a reason to believe again
I feel it coming over me
Im still a slave to these dreams
Is this the end of everything
Or just a new way to bleedIm dying praying bleeding and scremingIve spent so much time
Throwing rocks at your window
That I never even knocked
On your front door
I walk by statues
Never even made one chip away
But if I could leave a mark
On the monument of the heart
I just might lay myself down
For a little more than I had
The last day
The last day
The last day
Wait a time
To spare these lies we tell ourselves
These days have come and gone
But this time is sweeter than honeyStay alive soft dark and dreamless
Far beneath my nightmares and loneliness
I hate me for breathing without you
I dont want to feel anymore for you
Grieving for you Im not grieving for you
Nothing real love cant undo
And though I may have lost my way
All paths lead straight to you
I long to be like you
Lie cold in the ground like you

Melt away and leave us alone again
Humming haunted somewhere out there
I believe our love can see us through in death
I long to be like you
Lie cold in the ground like you

Youre not alone

And as we lay in silent bliss
I know you remember me
I long to be like you
Lie cold in the ground like you
Theres room inside for two
And Im not grieving for you
Im coming for youSparkling grey
There my own veins
Any more than a whisper
Any sudden movement of my heart
And I know I know
Ill have to watch them pass away
Just get through this day
Give up your way
You could be anything
Give up my way
And lose myself
Not today thats too much guilt to pay
Sickened in the sun
You dare tell me you love me
But you held me down and screamed you wanted me to die
Honey you knowyou knowId never hurt you that way
Youre just so pretty in your pain
Give up my way
And I could be anything
Ill make my own way
Without your senseless hatehatehatehate
So run run run
And hate me if it feels good
I cant hear your screams anymore
You lied to me
But Im older now
And Im not buyin baby
Demanding my response
Dont bother breaking the door down
Ive found my way out
And youll never hurt me againI cant see your star I cant see your star
Though I patiently waited bedside for the death of today
I cant see your star
The mechanical lights of Lisbon frightened it away
And Im alone now
Me and all I stood for were wandering now
All in parts and pieces swim lonely
Find your own way out
I cant see your star I cant see your star
How can the darkness feel so wrong
And Im alone now
Me and all I stood for were wandering now
All in parts and pieces swim lonely
Find your own way out
So far away
Its growing colder without your love
Why cant you feel me calling your name
Cant break the silence its breaking me
All my fears turn to rage
And Im alone now
Me and all I stood for were wandering now
All in parts and pieces swim lonely
Find your own way out now
Hey and nothing worth fighting for
Were wandering now
All in parts and pieces swim lonely
Find your own way outLithium dont want to lock me up inside
Lithium dont want to forget how it feels without
Lithium I want to stay in love with my sorrow
Oh but God I want to let it go
Come to bed dont make me sleep alone
Couldnt hide the emptiness you let it show
Never wanted it to be so cold
Just didnt drink enough to say you love me
I cant hold on to me
Wonder whats wrong with me
Lithium dont want to lock me up inside
Lithium dont want to forget how it feels without
Lithium I want to stay in love with my sorrow
Dont want to let it lay me down this time
Drown my will to fly
Here in the darkness I know myself
Cant break free until I let it go
Let me go
Darling I forgive you after all
Anything is better than to be alone
And in the end I guess I had to fall
Always find my place among the ashes
I cant hold on to me
Wonder whats wrong with me
Lithium dont want to lock me up inside
Lithium dont want to forget how it feels without
Lithium I want to stay in love with my sorrow
Oh but God I want to let it goUnder your spell again
I cant say no to you
Crave my heart and its bleeding in your hand
I cant say no to you
Shouldnt let you torture me so sweetly
Now I cant let go of this dream
I cant breathe but I feel
Good enough
I feel good enough for you
Drink up sweet decadence
I cant say no to you
And Ive completely lost myself and I dont mind
I cant say no to you
Shouldnt let you conquer me completely
Now I cant let go of this dream
Cant believe that I feel
Good enough
I feel good enough
Its been such a long time coming
But I feel good
And Im still waiting for the rain to fall
Pour real life down on me
Cause I cant hold on to anything
This good enough
Am I good enough
For you to love me too
So take care what you ask of me
Cause I cant say noYoure too important for anyone
Theres something wrong with everything you see
But I I know who you really are
Youre the one who cries when youre alone
Chorus
But where will you go
With no one left to save you from yourself
You cant escape
You cant escape
You think that I cant see right through your eyes
Scared to death to face reality
No one seems to hear your hidden cries
Youre left to face yourself alone
Chorus
I realize youre afraid
But you cant abandon everyone
You cant escape
You dont want to escape
Im so sick of speaking words that no one understands
Is it clear enough that you cant live your whole life all alone
I can hear you in a whisper
But you cant even hear me screaming
Chorus
I realize youre afraid
But you cant reject the whole world
You cant escape
You wont escape
You cant escape
You dont want to escapeCan you forgive me again
I dont know what I said
But I didnt mean to hurt you
I heard the words come out
I felt that I would die
It hurts so much to hurt you
Then you look at me
Youre not shouting anymore
Youre silently broken
Id give anything now
To kill those words for you
Each time I say something I regret
I cry I dont want to lose you
But somehow I know that you will never leave me yeah
Cause you were made for me
Somehow Ill make you see
How happy you make me Oh
I cant live this life
Without you by my side
I need you to survive
So stay with me
You look in my eyes
And Im screaming inside that Im sorry sorry
Ooh Im sorry
And you forgive me again
Youre my one true friend
And I never meant to hurt youI wanted you to be with me
For so long I dont even know by now
But now that Ive given up on you
Defiantly you see me
Walking away I see the pain
You put me through
You put me through
Lost in your game to change the same
Forever gone forever you
Theres something very wrong about this
I think you knew all along somehow
Youll only take me to change my mind
Lonely broken and defeated
So far away I see the truth
I see through you
Now that I know the way you play
I dont want to
Walking away I see the pain
You put me through
Lost in your game to change the same
Forever gone forever you
So far away I see the truth
I see through you
Now that I know the way you play
I dont want to
Walking away I see the pain
You put me through
Lost in your game to change the same
Forever gone forever youHow can I pretend that I dont see
What you hide so carelessly
I saw her bleed
You heard me breathe
And I froze inside myself and turned away
I must be dreaming
We all live we all die
That does not begin to justify you
Its not what it seems
Not what you think
No I must be dreaming
Its only in my mind
Not real life
No I must be dreaming
Help I know Ive got to tell someone
Tell them what I know youve done
I fear you but spoken fears can come true
We all live we all die
That does not begin to justify you
Its not what it seems
Not what you think
No I must be dreaming
Its only in my mind
Not real life
No I must be dreaming
We all live we all die
That does not begin to justify you
Its not what it seems
Not what you think
No I must be dreaming
Its only in my mind
Not real life
No I must be dreaming
Not what it seems
Not what you think
I must be dreaming
Just in my mind
Not real life
I must be dreamingDont cry to me if you loved me
You would be here with me
You want me come find me
Make up your mind
Should I let you fall lose it all
So maybe you can remember yourself
Cant keep believing
Were only deceiving ourselves
And Im sick of the lie
And youre too late
Dont cry to me if you loved me
You would be here with me
You want me come find me
Make up your mind
Couldnt take the blame sick with shame
Must be exhausting to lose your own game selfishly hated
No wonder youre jaded
You cant play the victim this time
And youre too late
Dont cry to me if you loved me
You would be here with me
You want me come find me
Make up your mind
You never call me when youre sober
You only want it cause its over its over
How could I have burned paradise
How could I
You were never mine
So dont cry to me if you loved me
You would be here with me
Dont lie to me just get your things
Ive made up your mindBound at every limb by my shackles of fear
Sealed with lies through so many tears
Lost from within pursuing the end
I fight for the chance to be lied to again
You never were strong enough
You you never were good enough
You were never conceived in love
You will not rise above
Theyll never see
Ill never be
Ill struggle on and on to feed this hunger
Burning deep inside of me
But through my tears breaks a blinding light
Birthing a dawn to this endless night
Arms outstretched awaiting me
An open embrace upon a bleeding tree
Rest in me and Ill comfort you
I have lived and I died for you
Abide in me and I vow to you
I will never forsake you
Theyll never see
Ill never be
Ill struggle on and on to feed this hunger
Burning deep inside of me
Theyll never see
Ill never be
Ill struggle on and on to feed this hunger
Burning deep inside of meYou dont remember my name
I dont really care
Can we play the game your way
Can I really lose control
Just once in my life
I think itd be nice
Just to lose control just once
With all the pretty flowers in the dust
Mary had a lamb
His eyes black as coals
If we play very quiet my lamb
Mary never has to know
Just once in my life
I think itd be nice
Just to lose control just once
If I cut you down to a thing I can use
I fear there will be nothing good left of you
Just to lose control just onceMeet me after dark again and Ill hold you
I want nothing more than to see you there
And maybe tonight well fly so far away
Well be lost before the dawn
If only night can hold you where I can see you my love
Then let me never ever wake again
And maybe tonight well fly so far away
Well be lost before the dawn
Somehow I know that
We cant wake again from this dream
Its not real but its ours
Maybe tonight well fly so far away
Well be lost before the dawnGive me a reason to believe that youre gone
I see your shadow so I know theyre all wrong
Moonlight on the soft brown earth
It leads me to where you lay
They took you away from me but now Im taking you home
Chorus
I will stay forever here with you
My love
The softly spoken words you gave me
Even in death our love goes on
Some say Im crazy for my love oh my love
But no bonds can hold me from your side oh my love
They dont know you cant leave me
They dont hear you singing to me
ChorusI hold my breath as this life starts to take its toll
I hide behind a smile as this perfect plan unfolds
But oh God I feel Ive been lied to
Lost all faith in the things I have achieved and I
Ive woken now to find myself
In the shadows of all that I have created
Im longing to be lost in you
Away from this place I have made
Wont you take me away from me
Crawling through this world as disease flows through my veins
I look into myself but my own heart has been changed
I cant go on like this I loathe all Ive become
Ive woken now to find myself
In the shadows of all that I have created
Im longing to be lost in you
Away from this place I have made
Wont you take me away from me
Lost in a dying world I reach for something more
I have grown so weary of this lie I live
Ive woken now to find myself
In the shadows of all that I have created
Im longing to be lost in you
I Ive woken now to find myself
Ive been lost in shadows of my own
Im longing to be lost in you away from me from me
From me from me from me
From me from me from meIs this real enough for you
You were so confused
Now that youve decided to stay
Well remain together
You cant abandon me
You belong to me
Breathe in and take my life in you
No longer myself only you
Theres no escaping me my love
Surrender
Darling theres no sense in running
You know I will find you
Everything is perfect now
We can live forever
You cant abandon me
You belong to me
Breathe in and take my life in you
No longer myself only you
Theres no escaping me my love

Listen to the rain

I stand alone in the storm
Suddenly sweet words take hold
Hurry they say For you havent much time
Open your eyes to the love around you
You may feel youre alone
But Im here still with you
You can do what you dream
Just remember to listen to the rain
Listen
Listen
Listen
How many times have you told me you love her
As many times as I wanted to tell you the truth
How long have I stood here beside you
I lived through you you looked through me
Ooo solitude
Still with me is only you
Ooo solitude
I cant stay away from you
How many times have I done this to myself
How long will it take before I see
When will this hole in my heart be mended
Who now is left alone but me
Ooo solitude
Forever me and forever you
Ooo solitude
Only you only true
Everyone leaves me stranded
Forgotten abandoned left behind
I cant stay here another night
Your secret admirer who could it be
Ooo cant you see
All along it was me
How can you be so blind
As to see right through me
And ooo solitude
Still with me is only you
Ooo solitude
I cant stay away from you
Solitude
Forever me and forever you
Ooo solitude
Only you only trueAll that Im living for
All that Im dying for
All that I cant ignore alone at night
I can feel the night beginning
Separate me from the living
Understanding me
After all Ive seen
Piecing every thought together
Find the words to make me better
If I only knew how to pull myself apart
All that Im living for
All that Im dying for
All that I cant ignore alone at night
All that Im wanted for
Although I wanted more
Lock the last open door my ghosts are gaining on me
I believe that dreams are sacred
Take my darkest fears and play them
Like a lullaby
Like a reason why
Like a play of my obsessions
Make me understand the lesson
So Ill find myself
So I wont be lost again
All that Im living for
All that Im dying for
All that I cant ignore alone at night
All that Im wanted for
Although I wanted more
Lock the last open door my ghosts are gaining on me
Guess I thought Id have to change the world
To make you see me
To be the one
I could have run forever
But how for would I have come
Without mourning your love
All that Im living for
All that Im dying for
All that I cant ignore alone at night
All that Im wanted for
Although I wanted more
Lock the last open door my ghosts are gaining on me
Should it hurt to love you
Should I feel like I do
Should I lock the last open door my ghosts are gaining on meIts true were all a little insane
But its so clear now that Im unchained

Theres nowhere to run
So lets just get it over

Youre just like me
Dont scream anymore my love
Cause all I want is you
Wake up in a dream
Frozen fear

And I dont sleep I dont sleep
See you belong to me
My snow white queen
Theres nowhere to run
So lets just get it over
Soon my love youll see
Youre just like me
Dont scream anymore my love
Cause all I want is you
Cant save your life
Though nothing I bleed for

Im losing my mind
And you just stand there
And stare as my world divides
You belong to me
My snow white queen
Theres nowhere to run
So lets just get it over
Soon my love youll see
Youre just like me
Dont scream anymore my love
Cause all I want is you
All I want is you
All I want is you
All I want is youYou dont remember me but I remember you
I lie awake and try so hard not to think of you
But who can decide what they dream
And dream I do
I believe in you
Ill give up everything just to find you
I have to be with you to live to breathe
Youre taking over me
Have you forgotten all I know
And all we had
You saw me mourning my love for you
And touched my hand
I knew you loved me then
I believe in you
Ill give up everything just to find you
I have to be with you to live to breathe
Youre taking over me
I look in the mirror and see your face
If I look deep enough
So many things inside that are just like you are taking over
I believe in you
Ill give up everything just to find you
I have to be with you to live to breathe
Youre taking over me
I believe in you
Ill give up everything just to find you
I have to be with you to live to breathe
Youre taking over me
Youre taking over meDear my love havent you wanted to be with me
And dear my love havent you longed to be free
I cant keep pretending that I dont even know you
And at sweet night you are my own
Take my hand

Theres no need to tell anyone
Theyd only hold us down
So by the morning light
Well be half way to anywhere
Where love is more than just your name
I have dreamt of a place for you and I
No one knows who we are there
All I want is to give my life only to you
Ive dreamt so long I cannot dream anymore
Lets run away Ill take you there

Where love is more than just your nameShe eyes me like a Pisces when I am weak
Ive been locked inside your heart-shaped box for weeks
Ive been drawn into your magnet tar pit trap
I wish I could eat your cancer when you turn black
Hey

Forever in debt to your priceless advice
Hey

Forever in debt to your priceless advice your advice
Meat-eating orchids forgive no one just yet

Broken hymen of your Highness Im left back
Throw down your umbilical noose so I can climb right back

Forever in debt to your priceless advice

Hey

Forever in debt to your priceless advice your advice your advice your advicePlease please forgive me
But I wont be home again
Maybe someday youll have woke up
And barely conscious youll say to no one
Isnt something missing
You wont cry for my absence I know
You forgot me long ago
Am I that unimportant
Am I so insignificant
Isnt something missing
Isnt someone missing me
Even though Im the sacrifice
You wont try for me not now
Though Id die to know you love me
Im all alone
Isnt someone missing me
Please please forgive me
But I wont be home again
I know what you do to yourself
I breathe deep and cry out
Isnt something missing
Isnt someone missing me
Even though Im the sacrifice
You wont try for me not now
Though Id die to know you love me
Im all alone
Isnt someone missing me
And if I bleed Ill bleed
Knowing you dont care
And if I sleep just to dream of you
And wake without you there
Isnt something missing
Isnt something
Even though Im the sacrifice
You wont try for me not now
Though Id die to know you love me
Im all alone
Isnt someone missing meThe words have been drained from this pencil
Sweet words that I want to give you
And I cant sleep
I need to tell you
Goodnight
When were together I feel perfect
When Im pulled away from you I fall apart
All you say is sacred to me
Your eyes are so blue
I cant look away
As we lay in the stillness
You whisper to me
Amy marry me
Promise youll stay with me
Oh you dont have to ask me
You know youre all that I live for
You know Id die just to hold you
Stay with you
Somehow Ill show you
That you are my night sky
Ive always been right behind you
Now Ill always be right beside you
So many nights I cried myself to sleep
Now that you love me I love myself
I never thought I would say this
I never thought thered be
YouIve been looking in the mirror for so long
That Ive come to believe my souls on the other side
All the little pieces falling shatter
Shards of me
Too sharp to put back together
Too small to matter
But big enough to cut me into so many little pieces
If I try to touch her
And I bleed
I bleed
And I breathe
I breathe no more
Take a breath and I try to draw from my spirits well
Yet again you refuse to drink like a stubborn child
Lie to me
Convince me that Ive been sick forever
And all of this
Will make sense when I get better
but I know the difference
Between myself and my reflection
I just cant help but to wonder
Which of us do you love
So I bleed
I bleed
And I breathe
I breathe no
Bleed
I bleed
And I breathe
I breathe
I breathe
I breathe no moreI cant run anymore
I fall before you
Here I am
I have nothing left
Though Ive tried to forget
Youre all that I am
Take me home
Im through fighting it
Broken
Lifeless
I give up
Youre my only strength
Without you
I cant go on
Anymore
Ever again
My only hope
All the times Ive tried
My only peace
To walk away from you
My only joy
My only strength
I fall into your abounding grace
My only power
My only life
And love is where I am
My only love
I cant run anymore
I give myself to you
Im sorry
Im sorry
In all my bitterness
I ignored
All thats real and true
All I need is you
When night falls on me
Ill not close my eyes
Im too alive
And youre too strong
I cant lie anymore
I fall down before you
Im sorry
Im sorry
My only hope
All the times Ive tried
My only peace
To walk away from you
My only joy
My only strength
I fall into your abounding grace
My only power
My only life
And love is where I am
My only love
Constantly ignoring
The pain consuming me
But this time its cut too deep
Ill never stray again
My only hope
All the times Ive tried
My only peace
To walk away from you
My only joy
My only strength
I fall into your abounding grace
My only power
My only life
And love is where I am
My only love
My only hope
All the times Ive tried
My only peace
To walk away from you
My only joy
My only strength
I fall into your abounding grace
My only power
My only life
And love is where I am
My only loveIf you want to live let live
If you want to go let go
Im not afraid to dream to sleep sleep forever
I dont need to touch the sky
I just want to feel that high
And you refuse to lift me
Guess it wasnt real after all
Guess it wasnt real all along
If I fall and all is lost
Its where I belong
If you want to live let live
If you want to go let go
Im never gonna be your sweet sweet surrender
Guess it wasnt real after all
Guess it wasnt real all along
If I fall and all is lost
No light to lead the way
Remember that all alone
Is where I belong
In a dream
Will you give your love to me
Beg my broken heart to beat
Save my life change my mind
If I fall and all is lost
No light to lead the way
Remember that all alone
Is where I belongGoodnight sleep tight
No more tears
In the morning Ill be here
And when we say goodnight
Dry your eyes
Because we said goodnight
And not goodbye
We said goodnight
And not goodbyeLong lost words whisper slowly to me
Still cant find what keeps me here
When all this time Ive been so hollow inside
I know youre still there
Watching me wanting me
I can feel you pull me down
Fearing you loving you
I wont let you pull me down
Hunting you I can smell you - alive
Your heart pounding in my head
Watching me wanting me
I can feel you pull me down
Saving me raping me
Watching meSparkling grey
There my own veins
Any more than a whisper
Any sudden movement of my heart
And I know I know
Ill have to watch them pass away
Just get through this day
Give up your way
You could be anything
Give up my way
And lose myself
Not today thats too much guilt to pay
Sickened in the sun
You dare tell me you love me
But you held me down and screamed you wanted me to die
Honey you knowyou knowId never hurt you that way
Youre just so pretty in your pain
Give up my way
And I could be anything
Ill make my own way
Without your senseless hatehatehatehate
So run run run
And hate me if it feels good
I cant hear your screams anymore
You lied to me
But Im older now
And Im not buyin baby
Demanding my response
Dont bother breaking the door down
Ive found my way out
And youll never hurt me againDont cry to me if you loved me
You would be here with me
You want me come find me
Make up your mind
Should I let you fall lose it all
So maybe you can remember yourself
Cant keep believing
Were only deceiving ourselves
And Im sick of the lie
And youre too late
Dont cry to me if you loved me
You would be here with me
You want me come find me
Make up your mind
Couldnt take the blame sick with shame
Must be exhausting to lose your own game selfishly hated
No wonder youre jaded
You cant play the victim this time
And youre too late
Dont cry to me if you loved me
You would be here with me
You want me come find me
Make up your mind
You never call me when youre sober
You only want it cause its over its over
How could I have burned paradise
How could I
You were never mine
So dont cry to me if you loved me
You would be here with me
Dont lie to me just get your things
Ive made up your mindMeet me after dark again and Ill hold you
I have nothing more than to see you there
And maybe tonight well fly so far away
Well be lost before the dawn
If only night could hold you where i can see you my love
Then let me never ever wake again
And maybe tonight well fly so far away
Well be lost before the dawn
Nakarat
somehow i know that we cant wake again from this dream
its not real but its ours
Maybe tonight well fly so far away
Well be lost before the dawnI still remember the world
From the eyes of a child
Slowly those feelings
Were clouded by what I know now
Where has my heart gone
An uneven trade for the real world
I want to go back to
Believing in everything and knowing nothing at all
I still remember the sun
Always warm on my back
Somehow it seems colder now
Where has my heart gone
Trapped in the eyes of a stranger
I want to go back to
Believing in everythingYoure too important for anyone
Theres something wrong with everything you see
But I I know who you really are
Youre the one who cries when youre alone
Chorus
But where will you go
With no one left to save you from yourself
You cant escape
You cant escape
You think that I cant see right through your eyes
Scared to death to face reality
No one seems to hear your hidden cries
Youre left to face yourself alone
Chorus
I realize youre afraid
But you cant abandon everyone
You cant escape
You dont want to escape
Im so sick of speaking words that no one understands
Is it clear enough that you cant live your whole life all alone
I can hear you in a whisper
But you cant even hear me screaming
Chorus
I realize youre afraid
But you cant reject the whole world
You cant escape
You wont escape
You cant escape
You dont want to escapeFeels like the weight of the world
Like God in heaven gave me a turn
Dont cling to me I swear I cant fix you
Still in the dark can you fix me
Free fall free fall all through life
If you love me then let go of me
I wont be held down by who I used to be
Shes nothing to me
Feels like the weight of the world
Like all my screaming has gone unheard
And oh I know you dont believe in me
Safe in the dark how can you see
Free fall free fall all through life
If you love me then let go of me
I wont be held down by who I used to be
If you love me then let go of me
I wont be held down by who I was
If you love me then let go of me
I wont be held down by who I used to beIve been watching you from a distance
The distance sees through your disguise
All I want from you is your hurting
I want to heal you
I want to save you from the dark
Give unto me your troubles
Ill endure your suffering
Place onto me your burden
Ill drink your deadly poison
Why should I care if they hurt you
Somehow it matters more to me
Than if I were hurting myself
Save you save you
Ill save you
Give unto me your troubles
Ill endure your suffering
Place onto me your burden
Ill drink your deadly poison
Fear not the flame of my loves candle
Let it be the sun in your world of darkness
Give unto me all that frightens you
Ill have your nightmares for you
If you sleep soundly
Give unto me your troubles
Ill endure your suffering
Place onto me your burden
Ill drink your deadly poison
Fear not the flame of my loves candle
Let it be the sun in your world of darkness
Give unto me all that frightens you
Ill have your nightmares for you
If you sleep soundly
Fear not the flame of my loves candle
Let it be the sun in your world of darknessI linger in the doorway
Of alarm clock screaming monsters calling my name
Let me stay
Where the wind will whisper to me
Where the raindrops as theyre falling tell a story
In my field of paper flowers
And candy clouds of lullaby
I lie inside myself for hours
And watch my purple sky fly over me
Dont say Im out of touch
With this rampant chaos your reality
I know well what lies beyond my sleeping refuge
The nightmare I built my own world to escape
In my field of paper flowers
And candy clouds of lullaby
I lie inside myself for hours
And watch my purple sky fly over meDont cry to me if you loved me
You would be here with me
You want me come find me
Make up your mind
Should I let you fall lose it all
So maybe you can remember yourself
Cant keep believing
Were only deceiving ourselves
And Im sick of the lie
And youre too late
Dont cry to me if you loved me
You would be here with me
You want me come find me
Make up your mind
Couldnt take the blame sick with shame
Must be exhausting to lose your own game selfishly hated
No wonder youre jaded
You cant play the victim this time
And youre too late
Dont cry to me if you loved me
You would be here with me
You want me come find me
Make up your mind
You never call me when youre sober
You only want it cause its over its over
How could I have burned paradise
How could I
You were never mine
So dont cry to me if you loved me
You would be here with me
Dont lie to me just get your things
Ive made up your mindOut on your own cold and alone again
Can this be what you really wanted baby
Blame it on me set your guilt free
Nothing can hold you back now
Now that youre gone feel like myself again
Grieving the things I cant repair and willing
To let you blame it on me and set your guilt free
I dont want to hold you back now love
I cant change who I am not this time
I wont lie to keep you near me
And in this short life theres no time to waste on giving up
My love wasnt enough
And you can blame it on me just set your guilt free honey
I dont want to hold you back now loveBound at every limb by my shackles of fear
Sealed with lies through so many tears
Lost from within pursuing the end
I fight for the chance to be lied to again
You never were strong enough
You you never were good enough
You were never conceived in love
You will not rise above
Theyll never see
Ill never be
Ill struggle on and on to feed this hunger
Burning deep inside of me
But through my tears breaks a blinding light
Birthing a dawn to this endless night
Arms outstretched awaiting me
An open embrace upon a bleeding tree
Rest in me and Ill comfort you
I have lived and I died for you
Abide in me and I vow to you
I will never forsake you
Theyll never see
Ill never be
Ill struggle on and on to feed this hunger
Burning deep inside of me
Theyll never see
Ill never be
Ill struggle on and on to feed this hunger
Burning deep inside of meWhen they all come crashing down- midflight
You know youre not the only one
When theyre so alone they find a back door out of life
You know youre not the only one
Were all grieving
Lost and bleeding
All our lives
Weve been waiting
For someone to call our leader
All your lies
Im not believing
Heaven shine a light down on me
So afraid to open your eyes- hypnotized
You know youre not the only one
Never understood this life
And youre right I dont deserve but you know Im not the only one
Were all grieving
Lost and bleeding
All our lives
Weve been waiting
For someone to call our leader
All your lies
Im not believing
Heaven shine a light down on me
Dont look down
Dont look into the eyes of the world beneath you
Dont look down youll fall down
Youll become their sacrifice
Right or wrong
Cant hold onto the fear that Im lost without you
If I cant feel Im not mine
Im not real
All our lives
Weve been waiting
For someone to call our leader
All your lies
Im not believing
Heaven shine a light down on meMy black backpack stuffed with broken dreams
Twenty bucks should get me through the week
Never said a word of discontentment
Fought it a thousand times but now Im leaving home
Here in the shadows Im safe Im free
Ive nowhere else to go
But I cannot stay where I dont belong
Two months pass by and its getting cold
I know Im not lost Im just alone
But I wont cry I wont give up I cant go back now
Waking up is knowing who you really are
Here in the shadows Im safe Im free
Ive nowhere else to go
But I cannot stay where I dont belong
In the shadows Im safe Im free
Ive nowhere else to go
But I cannot stay here
Oh show me the shadow where true meaning lies
So much more dismay in empty eyesYou hold the answers deep within your own mind
Consciously youve forgotten it
Thats the way the human mind works
Whenever something is too unpleasant too shameful for us
to entertain we reject it
We erase it from our memories
But the imprint is always there
Cant wash it all away
Cant Wish it all away
Cant hope it all away
Cant cry it all away
The pain that grips you
The fear that binds you
Releases life in me
In our mutual
Shame we idolize
To blind them from the truth
That finds a way from who we are
Please dont be afraid
When the darkness fades away
The dawn will break the silence
Screaming in our hearts
My love for you still grows
This I do for you
Before I try to fight the truth
my final time
Were supposed to try and be real
And I feel alone and were not together And that is real
Cant wash it all away
Cant wish it all away
Cant cry it all away
Cant scratch it all away
Lying beside you
Listening to you breathe
The life that flows inside of you
Burns inside of me
Hold and speak to me
Of love without a sound
Tell me you will live through this
And I will die for you
Cast me not away
Say youll be with me
For I know I cannot
Bear it all alone
Youre not alone honey
Never Never
Cant fight it all away
Cant hope it all away
Cant scream it all away
It just wont fade away No
Cant wash it all away
Cant wish it all away
Cant cry it all away
Cant scratch it all away
Cant fight it all away
Cant hope it all away
Cant scream it all away
Ooh it all away
Ooh it all away
But the imprint is always there Nothing is ever really forgotten
Please dont hate me
Cause Id die if you do
Cause Id die if you do
Cause Id die if you do
Cause Id die if you doPlayground school bell rings again
Rain clouds come to play again
Has no one told you shes not breathing
Hello Im your mind giving you someone to talk to
Hello
If I smile and dont believe
Soon I know Ill wake from this dream
Dont try to fix me Im not broken
Hello Im the lie living for you so you can hide
Dont cry
Suddenly I know Im not sleeping
Hello Im Im still here
All thats left of yesterdayNow I will tell you what Ive done for you
Fifty thousand tears Ive cried
Screaming deceiving and bleeding for you
And you still wont hear me
Im going under
Dont want your hand this time Ill save myself
Maybe Ill wake up for once
Not tormented daily defeated by you
Just when I thought Id reached the bottom
Im dying again
Im going under going under
Drowning in you drowning in you
Im falling forever falling forever
Ive got to break through Im going under
Blurring and stirring the truth and the lies
So I dont know whats real and whats not
Always confusing the thoughts in my head
So I cant trust myself anymore
Im dying again
Im going under going under
Drowning in you drowning in you
Im falling forever falling forever
Ive got to break through Im
So go on and scream
Scream at me Im so far away
I wont be broken again
Ive got to breathe I cant keep going under
Im dying again
Im going under going under
Drowning in you drowning in you
Im falling forever falling forever
Ive got to break through Im going under
Going under
Im going underSave your twisted enemy
So you might earn forgiveness
You know your whole world is waiting
So why cant you speak
I feel it coming over me
Im still a slave to these dreams
Is this the end of everything
Or just a new way to bleed
So go and tell all your friends
That Im a failure underneath
If it makes you feel like a bigger man
But its my my heart my life
That youre calling a lie
Ive played this game before
And I cant take anymore
I feel it coming over me
Im still a slave to these dreams
Is this the end of everything
Or just a new way to bleed
By drifting far beyond the edge
Freedom freedom
Cant you feel the ground caving in
Freedom
Give us a reason to believe again
I feel it coming over me
Im still a slave to these dreams
Is this the end of everything
Or just a new way to bleedThe pain that grips you the fear that binds you
Releases life in me
In our mutual shame we hide our eyes
To blind them from the truth that finds a way from who we are
Cant wash it all away
Cant wish it all away
Cant cry it all away
Cant scratch it all away
Lying beside you listening to you breathe
The light that flows inside of you burns inside of me
Hold and speak to me of love without a sound
Tell me you will live through this and
I will die for you
Cast me not away say youll be with me
For I know I cannot bear it all alone
Cant fight it all away
Cant hope it all away
Cant scream it all away
It just wont fade awayI tried to kill the pain
But only brought more
So much more
I lay dying
And Im pouring crimson regret and betrayal
Im dying
Praying
Bleeding
Screaming
Am I too lost to be saved
Am I too lost
My God My tourniquet
Return to me salvation
My God My tourniquet
Return to me salvation
Do you remember me
Lost for so long
Will you be on the other side
Will you forget me
Im dying
Praying
Bleeding
Screaming
Am I too lost to be saved
Am I too lost
My God My tourniquet
Return to me salvation
My God My tourniquet
Return to me salvation
Return to me salvation
I want to die
My God My tourniquet
Return to me salvation
My God My tourniquet
Return to me salvation
My wounds cry for the grave
My soul cries for deliverance
Will I be denied
Christ Tourniquet My suicideSave your twisted enemy
So you might earn forgiveness
You know your whole world is waiting
So why cant you speak
I feel it coming over me
Im still a slave to these dreams
Is this the end of everything
Or just a new way to bleed
So go and tell all your friends
That Im a failure underneath
If it makes you feel like a bigger man
But its my my heart my life
That youre calling a lie
Ive played this game before
And I cant take anymore
I feel it coming over me
Im still a slave to these dreams
Is this the end of everything
Or just a new way to bleed
By drifting far beyond the edge
Freedom freedom
Cant you feel the ground caving in
Freedom
Give us a reason to believe again
I feel it coming over me
Im still a slave to these dreams
Is this the end of everything
Or just a new way to bleedWay down

And Ive been denying this feeling of hopelessness
In me in me
All the promises I made just to let you down
You believed in me but Im broken
I have nothing left
And all I feel is this cruel wanting
Weve been falling for all this time
And now Im lost in paradise
As much as Id like the past not to exist it still does
And as much as Id like to feel like I belong here
Im just as scared as you
I have nothing left
And all I feel is this cruel wanting
Weve been falling for all this time
And now Im lost in paradise
Run away run away
One day we wont feel this pain anymore
Take it all the way
Shadows of you
Cause they wont let me go
So I have nothing left
And all I feel is this cruel wanting
Weve been falling for all this time
And now Im lost in paradise
Alone and lost in paradiseIve been believing in something so distant as if I was human
And Ive been denying this feeling of hopelessness
In me in me
All the promises I made just to let you down
You believed in me but Im broken

And all I feel is this cruel wanting
Weve been falling for all this time
And now Im lost in paradise
As much as Id like the past not to exist it still does
And as much as Id like to feel like I belong here
Im just as scared as you
I have nothing left

Alone and lost in paradiseMake me whole again open your eyes
Taunted by the shadows of your lie
Cold and far away like youre not even mine
Undo everything and take me higher
Never believing what they say cause Im
Counting the days to meet you on the other side
I will always be waiting
Until the day that I see you on the other side
Come and take me home
Im not giving in I want you back
Holding together by the shards of our past
Stole my heart away I cant let you go
Break these chains and let me fly to you high above the world below
Over and over in my mind
Counting the days to meet you on the other side
I will always be waiting
Until the day that I see you on the other side
Come and take me home
I am so lost without my place inside your heart
I wont survive I need to know you hear me
Awaken and release my love
Counting the days to meet you on the other side
I will always be waiting
Until the day that I see you on the other side
Come and take me home
Counting the days to meet you on the other side
I will always be waiting
Until the day that I see you on the other side
Come and take me homeI will wander til the end of time torn away from you
I pull away to face the pain
I close my eyes and drift away
Over the fear that I will never find
A way to heal my soul
And I will wander til the end of time
Torn away from you
My heart is broken
Sweet sleep my dark angel
Deliver us from sorrows hold
Or from my hard heart
I cant go on living this way
And I cant go back the way I came
Shamed of this fear that I will never find
A way to heal my soul
And I will wander til the end of time
Half a life without you
My heart is broken
Sweet sleep my dark angel
Deliver us change open your eyes to the light
I denied it all so long oh so long
Say goodbye goodbye
My heart is broken
Release me I cant hold on
Deliver us my heart is broken
Sweet sleep my dark angel
Deliver us my heart is broken
Sweet sleep my dark angel
Deliver us from sorrows holdEmbrace the silence
Cause theres nothing that can change the way I feel
Taken all that you wanted
Now theres nothing that can change the way I feel
Hold on little girl
The end is soon to come
Sick of it all sick of it all
We will not follow
Sick of it all sick of it all
They dont understand how
Sick we are sick we are
Of this bottomless pit of lies behind closed eyes
Oceans between us
And theres nothing that can change the way I feel
I can still taste the poison of every fall
Every breath our ways to heal
Hold on little girl
The end is soon to come
Sick of it all sick of it all
We will not follow
Sick of it all sick of it all
They dont understand how
Sick we are sick we are
Of this bottomless pit of lies behind closed eyes
Someday youll know the peace
Someday the light will break through
And nothing you tell yourself
Will save us from the truth
Screamin out
Sick of it all sick of it all
We will not follow
Sick of it all sick of it all
They dont understand how
Sick we are sick we are
Of this bottomless pit of lies behind closed eyesIts taking you too long to decide
And I dont want to be the one the one
Crying over wasted time
If you think youre strong enough to let me in
Then come on stand up and be honest be honest
Im tired of feeling so alone
Cause you wont let me understand
I dont wanna pretend I wanna feel I want to love
Say you will or say you wont
Open your heart to me
Now or never tell the truth
Is this real is this real
Whenever youre around I cant fight it
You get under my skin the way that I like it
And I cant take anymore
Tell me what you want from me or leave me alone
Cause Im all caught up and Im losing control
Im tired of holding on so tight
When you wont let me understand
Now Im falling apart
I never meant to lose myself
Say you will or say you wont
Open your heart to me
Now or never tell the truth
Is this real is this real
Say you will or say you wont
Open your heart to me
Now or never tell the truth
Is this real is this real
Like drops of rain against my heart
Cut through like silver
And I want to make you feel that way
And I want to make you feel the way that I do
Say you will or say you wont
Open your heart to me
Now or never tell the truth
Is this real
Say you will or say you wont
Open your heart to me
Now or never tell the truth
Is this real is this realHollow like you dont remember me
Underneath everything I guess I always dreamed
That I would be the one to take you away
From all this wasted pain
But I cant save you from yourself
Chorus
Dont you want to feel
Dont you want to live your life
How much longer are you gonna
Give into the fear
Holding you down until youre
Frozen
I cant let you fall apart
You dont even know
What youve done to me
But I would be the one to take you away
From all this wasted pain
If you could just wake up
Chorus
All alone all alone
And drowning in your past
Take it back take it back
I still believe you can
Dont you want to feel
Dont you want to live your life How much longer are you gonna
Give into the fear
Holding you down till you disappearTurn out the lights
Feed the fire till my soul breathes free
My heart is high as the waves above me
Dont need to understand
Too lost to lose
Dont fight my tears cuz they feel so good
And I I will remember how to fly
Unlock the heavens in my mind
Follow my love back through the same secret door
Look past the end
Its a dream as its always been
All life lives on if weve ever loved it
And I I will remember how to fly
Unlock the heavens in my mind
Follow my love back through the same secret doorIts too late to change your mind
Even though this fragile world
Is tearing apart at the seams
We cant wash these sins away
This sinking feeling everyday
Im waking up in someone elses life
Is it so hard for you
Cause its so hard for me
To believe that what we dreamed
Could ever come to life again
Cause I cannot erase this lie
Not gonna let this day go by
Im gonna save this wasted life
And nothing can stand in my way
Not enough to say goodbye
Burn it til theres nothing left
Im drowning in the mess that I have made
Is it so hard for you
Cause its so hard for me
To believe that what we dreamed
Could ever come to life again
Cause I cannot erase this lie
The waters rising around us
There is no other way down
I only have myself to blame for it all
Is it so hard for you
Cause its so hard for me
To believe that what we dreamed
Could ever come to life again
If I could just erase my mind
But I cannot erase this lieDont want to be the one to walk away
But I cant bear the thought of one more day
I think I finally understand what it means to be lost
Cant find the road to lead us out of this
A million miles from where we burned the bridge
Cant keep pretending everythings going to be alright
With the whole world falling down on me
Cross the oceans in my mind
Find the strength to say goodbye
In the end you never can wash the blood from your hands
Fallen so far from where we were before
Youll never find what youve been searching for
Something to fill the void
And make up for all of those missing pieces of you
Like I could only dream to do
Cross the oceans in my mind
Find the strength to say goodbye
Everything that we believed in was a lie
Cross the oceans in your mind
Find a way to blur the line
In the end you never can wash the blood from your hands
Oh we never learn
So we fall down again
Heaven help me find a way to dream within this nightmare
Cross the oceans in my mind
Find the strength to say goodbye
Everything that we believed in was a lie
Cross the oceans in your mind
Find a way to blur the line
In the end you never can wash the blood from your handsHalfway down the stairs is a stair where I sit
There isnt any other stair quite like this
Im not at the bottom
Im not at the top
So this is the stair where I always stop
Halfway up the stairs
it isnt up it isnt down
It isnt in the Nursery it isnt in the town
And all sorts of funny thoughts
they run through my head
It isnt really anywhere
its somewhere else instead
Halfway down the stairs is a stair where I sit
There isnt any other stair quite like this
Im not at the bottom
Im not at the top
So this is the stair where I always
StopEverything is so dark
And I know theres something wrong but I cant turn the light on
In that split second change when you knew we couldnt hold on
I realized I lived to love you
Save yourself dont look back
Tearing us apart until its all gone
The only world Ive ever known sleeps beneath the waves
But I remember
I wont give up on you
I can feel you in my heart just show me the way
I dont belong here
Alone
I can still see your face
Where its burned into my mind I die every time
I close my eyes youre always there
Save yourself dont look back
Tearing us apart until its all gone
The only world Ive ever known sleeps beneath the waves
But Im the one whos drowning without your love
I am lost and I can never go back home
All across the ocean
We are calling calling
Are are you there
Nothing left for me till I find you because its
All gone the only world Ive ever known sleeps beneath the waves
But Im the one whos drowning without your love
I am lost and I can never go back
I I can never go back homeSpeak your mind
Like I care
I can see your lips moving
Ive just learned not to hear
Dont waste your time
Its never enough for you baby
Dont want to play your game anymore
No matter what you say
Im all out of love for you baby
And now that Ive tried everything
Ill numb the pain till I am made of stone
Take your time
Im not scared
Make me everything you need me to be
So the judgment seems fair
Dont waste your time
Its never enough for you baby
Dont want to play your game anymore
No matter what you say
Im all out of love for you baby
And now that Ive tried everything
Ill numb the pain till I am made to tear up my heart
For the way that it feels
I will still remember when youve long forgotten me
Its never enough for you baby
Dont want to play your game anymore
No matter what you say
Im all out of love for you baby
And now that Ive tried everything
Ill numb the pain till I am made of stone
Its never enough
Its never enough
Its never enough
Ill numb the pain till I am made of stone
Ill numb the pain till I am made of stoneI found a grave
Brushed off the face
Felt your light
I remember why I know this place
I found a bird
Closing her eyes
One last time
And I wonder if she dreamed like me
Well as much as it hurts
Aint it wonderful to feel
So go on and bring your wings
Follow your heart till it bleeds
As we run towards the end of the dream
Im not afraid
I push through the pain
And Im on fire
I remember how to breathe again
As much as it hurts
Aint it wonderful to feel
So go on and bring your wings
Follow your heart till it bleeds
As we run towards the end of the dream
Why must we fall apart to understand how to fly
I will find a way even without wings
Follow your heart till it bleeds
As we run towards the end of the dream
Follow your heart
Till it bleeds
And weve gone to the end of the dreamThought that I was strong
I know the words I need to say
Frozen in my place
I let the moment slip away
Ive been screaming on the inside
And I know you feel the pain
Can you hear me
Can you hear me
Say its over
Yes its over
But I need you anyway
Say you love me but its not enough
Never meant to lie
But Im not the girl you think you know
The more that I am with you
The more that I am all alone
Ive been screaming on the inside
And I know you feel the pain
Can you hear me
Can you hear me
Say its over
Yes its over
But I need you anyway
Say you love me but its not enough
Not that I so different
Not that I dont see
The dying light of what we used to be
But how could I forgive you
Youve changed
And Im a liar by your side
Im about to lose my mind
Cause Ive been screaming looking inside
And I know you feel the pain
Can you hear me
Can you hear me
Youve been dreaming
If youre thinking
That I still belong to you
Ive been dying
Cause Im lying to myself
Say its over
Yes its over
But I need you anyway
Say you love me but its not enoughIm so tired of being here
Suppressed by all my childish fears
And if you have to leave
I wish that you would just leave
Cause your presence still lingers here
And it wont leave me alone
These wounds wont seem to heal this pain is just too real
Theres just too much that time cannot erase
When you cried Id wipe away all of your tears
When youd scream Id fight away all of your fears
And I held your hand through all of these years
But you still have all of me
You used to captivate me by your resonating light
Now Im bound by the life you left behind
Your face it haunts my once pleasant dreams
Your voice it chased away all the sanity in me
These wounds wont seem to heal this pain is just too real
Theres just too much that time cannot erase
When you cried Id wipe away all of your tears
When youd scream Id fight away all of your fears
And I held your hand through all of these years
But you still have all of me
Ive tried so hard to tell myself that youre gone
But though youre still with me Ive been alone all along
When you cried Id wipe away all of your tears
When youd scream Id fight away all of your fears
And I held your hand through all of these years
You still have all of me me meIm so tired of being here
Suppressed by all my childish fears
And if you have to leave
I wish that you would just leave
Cause your presence still lingers here
And it wont leave me alone
These wounds wont seem to heal this pain is just too real
Theres just too much that time cannot erase
When you cried Id wipe away all of your tears
When youd scream Id fight away all of your fears
And I held your hand through all of these years
But you still have all of me
You used to captivate me by your resonating light
Now Im bound by the life you left behind
Your face it haunts my once pleasant dreams
Your voice it chased away all the sanity in me
These wounds wont seem to heal this pain is just too real
Theres just too much that time cannot erase
When you cried Id wipe away all of your tears
When youd scream Id fight away all of your fears
And I held your hand through all of these years

Ive tried so hard to tell myself that youre gone
But though youre still with me Ive been alone all along
When you cried Id wipe away all of your tears
When youd scream Id fight away all of your fears
And I held your hand through all of these years
You still have all of me me meNow I will tell you what Ive done for you
Fifty thousand tears Ive cried
Screaming deceiving and bleeding for you
And you still wont hear me
Im going under
Dont want your hand this time Ill save myself
Maybe Ill wake up for once
Not tormented daily defeated by you
Just when I thought Id reached the bottom
Im dying again
Im going under going under
Drowning in you drowning in you
Im falling forever falling forever
Ive got to break through Im going under
Blurring and stirring the truth and the lies
So I dont know whats real and whats not
Always confusing the thoughts in my head
So I cant trust myself anymore
Im dying again
Im going under going under
Drowning in you drowning in you
Im falling forever falling forever
Ive got to break through Im
So go on and scream
Scream at me Im so far away
I wont be broken again
Ive got to breathe I cant keep going under
Im dying again
Im going under going under
Drowning in you drowning in you
Im falling forever falling forever
Ive got to break through Im going under
Going under
Im going underI linger in the doorway
Of alarm clock screaming
Monsters calling my name
Let me stay
Where the wind will whisper to me
Where the raindrops
As theyre falling tell a story
In my field of paper flowers
And candy clouds of lullaby
I lie inside myself for hours
And watch my purple sky fly over me
Dont say Im out of touch
With this rampant chaos your reality
I know well what lies beyond my sleeping refuge
The nightmare I build my own world to escape
In my field of paper flowers
And candy clouds of lullaby
I lie inside myself for hours
And watch my purple sky fly over me
Swallowed up in the sound of my screaming
Cannot cease for the fear of silent lies
Oh how I long for the deep sleep dreaming
The goddess of imaginary light
In my field of paper flowers
And candy clouds of lullaby
I lie inside myself for hours
And watch my purple sky fly over me
