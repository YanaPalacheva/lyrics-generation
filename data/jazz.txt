And now the end is near
And so I face the final curtain
My friend Ill say it clear
Ill state my case of which Im certain
Ive lived a life thats full
Ive traveled each and every highway
But more much more than this
I did it my way
Regrets Ive had a few
But then again too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption
I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
And more much more than this
I did it my way
Yes there were times Im sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way
Ive loved Ive laughed and cried
Ive had my fill my share of losing
And now as tears subside
I find it all so amusing
To think I did all that
And may I say - not in a shy way
Oh no oh no not me
I did it my way
For what is a man what has he got
If not himself then he has naught
To say the things he truly feels
And not the words of one who kneels
The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way
Yes it was my wayWriters Raposo
When all the songs are out of tune
And all the rhythms ring so untrue
When I dont find the words to say
The thoughts I bring to you
When I hear lonely singers
Who are just as lost as me
Making noise not melody
You will be my music
You will be my song
You will be my music
I cant wait any longer if Im wrong
Ill never find the song to tell me
All the things I need to say
And Im afraid as time goes by
That someday soon youll go away
And Ill be lost and trying
For songs Ill never sing
Wanting you is evrything
You will be my music
You will be my song
You will be my music
I cant wait any longer if Im wrong
I cant wait any longer for my songMust you dance every dance
With the same fortunate man
You have danced with him since the music began
Wont you change partners and dance with me
Must you dance quite so close
With your lips touching his face
Cant you see
Im longing to be in his place
Wont you change partners and dance with me
Ask him to sit this one out and while youre alone
Ill tell the waiter to tell him hes wanted on the telephone
Youve been locked in his arms ever since heaven-knows-when
Wont you change partners and then
You may never want to change partners again
Wont you change partners and then
You may never want to change partners againHow little we know
How much to discover
What chemical forces flow
From lover to lover
How little we understand what touches of that tingle
That sudden explosion when two tingles intermingle
Who cares to define
What chemistry this is
Who cares with your lips on mine
How ignorant bliss is
So long as you kiss me and the world around us shatters
How little it matters how little we know
How little we know how little we knowThere is no great big ending
No sunset in the sky
There is no string ensemble
And she doesnt even cry
And just as I begin to say
That we should make another try
She reaches out across the table looks at me and quietly says good-bye
There is no big explosion
No tempest in the tea
The world does not stop turning round
Theres no big tragedy
Sitting in a coffee shop
With cheesecake and some apple pie
She reaches out across the table looks at me and quietly says good-bye
Good-bye
Said so easily
Good-bye
Said so quietly
Good-bye good-bye good-bye
Just two always strangers avoid each others eyes
One still make believing
One still telling lies
She tells me that Im not to blame
But when I ask the reason why
She reaches out across the table looks at me and quietly says good-bye
Good-bye
Said so easily
Good-bye
Said so quietly
Good-bye good-bye good-bye
She reaches out across the table looks at me and quietly says good-byeGoodbye no use leading with our chins this is where our story ends
Never lovers ever friends
Goodbye let our hearts call it a day but before you walk away
I sincerely want to say
I wish you bluebirds in the spring to give your heart a song to sing
And then a kiss but more than this i wish you love
And if you like lemonade to cool you in some lazy glade
I wish you health and more than wealth i wish you love
My breaking heart and i agree that you and i could never be
So with my best my very best i set you free
I wish you shelter from the storm a cozy fire to keep you warm
Most of all when snowflakes fall i wish you love
musical interlude
I wish you shelter from the storm a cozy fire to keep you warm
Most of all when snowflakes fall hot time i wish you love
All kinds of love a whole gang of loveIf a picture paints a thousand words
Then why cant I paint you
The words will never show
The you Ive come to know
If a face could launch a thousand ships
Then where am I to go
Theres no one home but you
And now youve left me too
And when my love for life is running dry
You come and pour yourself on me
If a man could be two places at one time
Id be with you
Tomorrow and today
Beside you all the way
If the world should stop revolving
Spinning slowly down to die
Id spend the end with you
And when the world was through
Then one by one the stars would all go out
Then you and I would simply fly awayThe night is bitter the stars have lost their glitter
The winds grow colder suddenly youre a lot older
And all because of a gal who got away
No more her eager call the writing is on the wall
All those dreams you dreamed they have all gone astray
The gal who won you shes run off and undone you
That great beginning has seen the final inning
I dont know what happened its all a crazy game
No more - no more that all time thrill because you have been put though the mill
And never a new love will ever be the same
Good riddance good-bye
Every trick of hers you are on to
But fools will be fools and wheres she gone
Where has she gone
The road gets rougher its lonelier and its tougher
With hope ya burn up tomorrow maybe shell turn up
There aint no let up live-long night night and day
Ever since since this world began
There aint nothin sadder than
A long-lost loser
Lookin for his gal who got away
Please come back
Wont ya come back
Mm mm mm
Mm mmmmDont worry bout me Ill get along
Forget about me be happy my love
Lets say that our little show is over and so the story ends
Why not call it a day the sensible way and still be friendsLook out for yourself should always be the rule
Give your heart and your love to whomever you love dont you be a fool
Darling why stop to cling to some fading thing that used to be If you cant forget dont you worry bout me
Baby why should you cling to some fading thing that used to be If you cant forget dont you worry bout meAll of me why not take all of me
Cant you see Im no good without you
Take my lips I want to lose them
Take my arms Ill never use them
Your good bye left me with eyes that cry
How can I get on dear without you
You took the part that once was my heart
So why not take all of me
All of me why not take all of me
Cant you see Im just a mess without you
Take my lips I want to lose them
Why dont you take my arms Ill never use them
Your good bye left me with eyes that cry
How can I get along without you
You know that you took a part that used to be my heart
So why not take all of meSomewhere beyond the sea
somewhere waiting for me
my lover stands on golden sands
and watches the ships that go sailin
Somewhere beyond the sea
shes there watching for me
If I could fly like birds on high
then straight to her arms
Id go sailin
Its far beyond the stars
its near beyond the moon
I know beyond a doubt
my heart will lead me there soon
Well meet beyond the shore
well kiss just as before
Happy well be beyond the sea
and never again Ill go sailin
I know beyond a doubt
my heart will lead me there soon
Well meet I know well meet beyond the shore
Well kiss just like before
Happy well be beyond the sea
and never again Ill go sailin
no more sailin
so long sailin
bye bye sailin
move on out captainShes a fool and dont I know it
But a fool can have her charms
Im in love and dont I show it
Like a babe in arms
Loves the same old situation
Lately Ive not slept a wink
Since this crazy situation
Has me on the blink
Im wild again beguiled again
A whimpering simpering child again
Bewitched bothered and bewildered - am I
Couldnt sleep wouldnt sleep
Love came and told me shouldnt sleep
Bewitched bothered and bewildered - am I
I lost my heart but what of it
She is cold I agree
She might laugh but I love it
Although the laughs on me
Ill sing to her bring spring to her
And long for the day when Ill cling to her
Bewitched bothered and bewildered - am IWhenever skies look gray to me
and trouble begins to brew
Whenever the winter winds become too strong
I concentrate on you
When fortune cries Nay nay to me
People declare Youre through
Whenever the blues become my only songs
I concentrate on you
On your smile so sweet so tender
When at first my kiss you do decline
On the light in your eyes when you surrender
And once again our arms intertwine
And so when wise men say to me
That loves young dream never comes true
To prove that even the wise men can be wrong
I concentrate on youA fine romance with no kisses
A fine romance my friend this is
We should be like a couple of hot tomatoes
But youre as cold as yesterdays mashed potatoes
A fine romance you wont nestle
A fine romance you wont wrestle
I might as well play bridge
With my old maid aunt
I havent got a chance
This is a fine romance
A fine romance my good fellow
You take romance Ill take jello
Youre calmer than the seals
In the Arctic Ocean
At least they flap their fins
To express emotion
A fine romance with no quarrels
With no insults and all morals
Ive never mussed the crease
In your blue serge pants
I never get the chance
This is a fine romanceMy story is much too sad to be told
But practically everything leaves me totally cold
The only exception I know is the case
When Im out on a quiet spree
Fighting vainly the old ennui
And I suddenly turn and see your fabulous face
I get no kick from champagne
Mere alcohol doesnt thrill me at all
So tell me why should it be true
That I get a kick out of you
Some they may go for a cocaine
Im sure that if I took even one sniff
It would bore me terrifically too
Yet I get a kick out of you
I get a kick every time I see you
Standing there before me
I get a kick though its clear to see
You obviously do not adore meIll never smile again
Until I smile at you
Ill never laugh again
What good would it do
For tears would fill my eyes
My heart would realize
That our romance is true
Ill never love again
Im so in love with you
Ill never thrill again
To somebody new
Within my heart
I know I will never start
To smile again
Until I smile at you
Within my heart
I know I will never start
To smile again
Until I smile at youBluebirds flowers
Sunshine and showers
Sunsets and rainbows
On skies of red and blue
Badges whistles
Rockets and missiles
Puppies kittens
And penny candy too
You make me feel so new
Like carnivals and carousels
Popsicles and wishing wells
And I am so in love with you
I cant believe its true
Were gonna make it all the way home
Magic potions
Incense and lotions
Bells books and candles
Can make a witches brew
But I dont need witches
Love spells or riches
You are my treasure
My fairy tale come true
With you is where Ill stay
All the time anywhere
Turn around and Ill be there
It was I now its we
And I know it will be
You and me all the way home
Me and you all the way homeA little voice keeps talking to me
From a way down deep inside
What does this voice keep saying to me
It says pass this affair and pass it wide
You may be a puzzle but I like the way the parts fit
Still that little voice says Go get your track shoes -put them on and get
We could go the distance
And find us romance
I like your persistence
Your style and your stance
Theres only one problem - the tiniest problem
I like to lead when I dance
Your eyes do the speaking
They talk with each glance
My will-powers creaking
I might take a the chance
And though youre the charmer - who could bend my armor
I like to lead when I dance
I like to steer the car - whenever I drive
And hold the door ajar - when we arrive
So if its decided - that this is romance
My sweet Ill repeat - in advance
I like to lead when I dance
I like to lead when I dance
When Adam bit the fruit - as fashions were then
He got that fig-leaf suit - for which Amen
So if its decided - Im wearing the pants
Then Eve Id say weve - got romance
I like to lead - I set the speed
I like to lead when I dance
When I dance when I dance when I danceSinging carols stringing popcorn
Making footprints in the snow
Memories Christmas memories
Theyre the sweetest ones I know
Cookies baking in the kitchen
Cards and ribbons everywhere
Frosty Christmas memories
Float like snowflakes in the air
And oh the joy of waking Christmas mornings
The family round the tree
We had a way of making Christmas morning
As merry as can be
I close my eyes and see shining faces
Of all the children who now have children of their own
Funny but comes December
And I remember every Christmas Ive knownChestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yule-tide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight
They know that Santas on his way
Hes loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mothers child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly
And so Im offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although its been said many times many ways
Merry Christmas to youGo go tell everybody
Go go tel tell everybody go
Go tell tell everybody go
Go tell tell everybody go
Go tell it on the mountain
Over the hills and everywhere
Go tell it on the mountain
That Jesus Christ is born
Go tell it on the mountain
Over the hills and everywhere
Go tell it on the mountain
That Jesus Christ is born
While shepherds kept their watching
For silent flocks by night
Behold throughout the heavens
There shone a holy light
Go tell it on the mountain
Over the hills and everywhere
Go tell it on the mountain
That Jesus Christ is born
Go tell it on the mountain
Over the hills and everywhere
Go tell it on the mountain
That Jesus Christ is born
The shepherds stirred and trembled
When lo above the earth
Rang out the angels calling
That hail our saviors birth
Go tell it on the mountain
Over the hills and everywhere
Go tell it on the mountain
That Jesus Christ is born
Go tell it on the mountain
Over the hills and everywhere
Go tell it on the mountain
That Jesus Christ is born
Tell me the lowly savior
A humble cloth was worn
And then there was the vision
And on the crib was born
Go tell it on the mountain
Over the hills and everywhere
Go tell it on the mountain
That Jesus Christ is born
You better go tell it on the mountain
Over the hills and everywhere
Go tell it on the mountain
That Jesus Christ is born
That Jesus Christ is born
That Jesus Christ is bornMerry Christmas
Merry Christmas
May your New Year dreams come true
Frosted window panes
Candles gleaming inside
Painted candy canes on the tree
Santas on his way
Hes filled his sleigh with things
Things for you and for me
Its that time of year
When the world falls in love
Every song you hear seems to say
Merry Christmas
May your New Year dreams come true
And this song of mine
In three-quarter time
Wishes you and yours
The same thing too
Santas on his way
Hes filled his sleigh with things
Things for you and for meI wouldnt trade Christmas no no never would I
Wouldnt trade Christmas I love you the best
I wouldnt trade Christmas no no never would I
Wouldnt trade Christmas I love you the best
Its time for the hollys of fun and the folly or all of that jolly jazz
The people are glowing the sand is now showing each window is showing it has
All the latest in choicing the daddy invoicing and all that razzle that does
But I wouldnt trade Christmas wouldnt trade Christmas for New Years Day
Thanksgiving Halloween and the rest Christmas we love you the best
I wouldnt trade no no never would I wouldnt trade Christmas I love you the best
The traffic gets poky the turkey gets smoky and all of that holy stuff
The people are shopping for things theyll be swapping like filigree boxes of snuff
Though you pour the hot toddy to force everybody though half of the toddys enough
I wouldnt trade Christmas wouldnt trade Christmas for Fathers Day or Mothers
Valentine and the rest Christmas we love you the best
The jingle fell jingle you feel the old tingle you buy the first single sceneHave yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
From now on our troubles will be out of sight
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yuletide gay
From now on our troubles will be miles away
Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more
Through the years we all will be together
If the fates allow
So hang a shining star upon the highest bough
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
From now on our troubles will be out of sight
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yuletide gay
From now on our troubles will be miles away
Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more
Through the years we all will be together
If the fates allow
So hang a shining star upon the highest bough
And have yourself a merry little Christmas nowI heard the bells on Christmas day
Their old familiar carols play
And wild and sweet the words repeat
Of peace on earth good will to men
I thought how as the day had come
The belfries of all Christendom
Had rolled along th unbroken song
Of peace on earth good will to men
And in despair I bowed my head
There is no peace on earth I said
For hate is strong and mocks the song
Of peace on earth good will to men
Then pealed the bells more loud and deep
God is not dead nor doth He sleep
The wrong shall fail the right prevail
With peace on earth good will to menIve got my love to keep me warm
Off with my overcoat
Off with my glove
I need no overcoat
Im burning with love
My hearts on fire
The flame goes higher
But I can weather the storm
What do I care how much it may storm
Ive got my love to keep me warmGive me an old fashioned Christmas an old fashioned Christmas
Family faces wide open spaces covered with snow
Right now my mom there in the kitchen basting the Christmas bird
Youll have to take my word you cant find that at the automat
An old fashioned fireplace give me an old fashioned fireplace
My heart remembers smoldering embers warming your glow
Id trade that whole Manhattan skyline the shimmering steel and chrome
For one old fashioned Christmas back homeThe season is upon us now
A time for gifts and giving
And as the year draws to its close
I think about my living
The Christmas time when I was young
The magic and the wonder
But colors dull and candles dim
And dark my standing under
O little Zachary shining light
Youve set my soul to dreaming
Youve given back my joy in life
And filled me with new meaning
A Savior King was born that day
A baby just like you
And as the Magi came with gifts
I come with my gift too
That peace on Earth fills up your time
That brotherhood surrounds you
That you may know the warmth of love
And wrap it all around you
Its just a wish a dream Im told
From days when I was young
Merry Christmas little Zachary
Merry Christmas everyone
Merry Christmas little Zachary
Merry Christmas everyoneTherell be a hot time in the town of Berlin
When the Yanks go marching in
I wanna be there boy and spread some joy
When they take old Berlin
Therell be a hot time in the town of Berlin
When the Brooklyn boys begin
To take the joint apart and tear it down
When they take old Berlin

And change the Heil to Whatcha-know-Joe

After they take Berlin

And change the Heil to Gimme some skin
Therell be a hot time in the town of Berlin
When the Yanks go marching in
You could never keep em happy down on the farm
After they take BerlinOh they say some people long ago
Were searching for a different tune
One that they could croon
As only they can
They only had the rhythm
So they started swaying to and fro
They didnt know just what to use
That is how the blues really began
They heard the breeze in the trees
Singing weird melodies
And they made that the start of the blues
And from a jail came the wail
Of a down-hearted frail
And they played that
As part of the blues
From a whippoorwill
Out on a hill
They took a new note
Pushed it through a horn
Til it was worn
Into a blue note
And then they nursed it rehearsed it
And gave out the news
That the Southland gave birth to the bluesDay by day Im falling more in love with you
And day by day my love seems to grow
There isnt any end to my devotion
Its deeper dear by far than any ocean
I find that
Day by day youre making all my dreams come true
So come what may I want you to know
Im yours alone and Im in love to stay
As we go through the years day by day
Im yours alone and Im in love to stay
As we go through the years day by dayMerry Christmas

The Biltmore Garage wants a grand but we aint got a grand on hand

And things being how they are the back of the police station is out
So the Biltmore Garage is the spot but the one thousand bucks we aint got
Why its good old reliable Nathan Nathan Nathan Nathan Detroit

Gotta have the game or well die from shame
Its the oldest established permanent floating crap game in New YorkWere going through the impatient years
The years when the day seems twice as long
Restless and sighing and laughing and crying
And dreaming a dream people say is wrong
But well journey through the impatient years
To each others arms where we belong clinging together
Im certain well weather the warm and stormy day and impatient year
But well journey through the impatient years
To each others arms where we belong clinging together

The girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes each one she passes
Goes A-a-a-h
When she walks shes like a samba
When she walks shes like a samba
That swings so cool and sways so gentle
That when she passes each one she passes
Goes A-a-a-h
Oh but I watch her so sadly
How can I tell her I love her
Yes I would give my heart gladly
But each day as she walks to the sea
She looks straight ahead not at me
Tall and tan and young and lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes I smile but she
Doesnt see She just doesnt see
No she just doesntHows your love life
hows your heartbeat
how do you do with me
Hows that new boy
how does he rate
how do you do without me
My doctors say Im fit and healthy
I really come on
My bank will tell you that Im solvent
except that Im overdrawn
So hows forgiving
hows forgetting
how can you do this to me
And hows for living
hows for getting a flat with me as a lessee
I tell you what
youre in a rot
you need a caretaker see
Honey how could you do
how do you do without meWhat is America to me
A name a map or a flag I see
A certain word democracy
What is America to me
The house I live in
A plot of Earth a street
The grocer and the butcher
And the people that I meet
The children in the playground
The faces that I see
All races and religions
Thats America to me
The place I work in
The worker by my side
The little town the city
Where my people lived and died
The howdy and the handshake
The air a feeling free
And the right to speak your mind out
Thats America to me
The things I see about me
The big things and the small
The little corner newsstand
Or the house a mile tall
The wedding and the churchyard
The laughter and the tears
The dream thats been a growing
For a hundred and fifty years
The town I live in
The street the house the room
The pavement of the city
Or the garden all in bloom
The church the school the clubhouse
The million lights I see
But especially the people
Thats America to meSome day when Im awfully low
When the world is cold
I will feel a glow just thinking of you
And the way you look tonight
Yes youre lovely with your smile so warm
And your cheeks so soft
There is nothing for me but to love you
And the way you look tonight
With each word your tenderness grows
Tearin my fear apart
And that laugh wrinkles your nose
Touches my foolish heart
Lovely never never change
Keep that breathless charm
Wont you please arrange it
Cause I love you
A-just the way you look tonight
And that laugh that wrinkles your nose
It touches my foolish heart
Lovely dont you ever change
Keep that breathless charm
Wont you please arrange it
Cause I love you
A-just the way you look tonight
Mm mm mm mm
Just the way you look tonightWhen I was young
I never needed anyone
Making love was just for fun
That day is done
Livin alone
I think about the friends Ive known
But when I dial the telephone
Nobodys home
All by myself
Dont wanna be
All by myself
Anymore
All by myself
Dont wanna live
All by myself
Anymore
Never too sure
Sometimes Im so insecure
The love thats distant and obscure
Remains the cure
All by myself
Dont wanna be
All by myself
Anymore
All by myself
Dont wanna live
All by myself
Anymore
instrumental
All by myself
Dont wanna be
All by myself
Anymore
All by myself
Dont wanna live
All by myself
Anymore
When I was young
I never needed anyone
And making love was just for fun
Those days are goneIm not much to look at nothin to see
Just glad Im livin and happy to be
I got a woman crazy for me
Shes funny that way
I cant save a dollar aint worth a cent
Shed never holler shed live in a tent
I got a woman crazy for me
Shes funny that way
Though shed love to work and slave for me every day
Shed be so much better off if I went away
But why should I leave her why should I go
Shed be unhappy without me I know
I got a woman crazy for me
Shes funny that wayEvry morning memries stray
Across the sea where flying fishes play
And as the night is falling
I find that Im recalling
That blissful all enthralling day
Just before I sailed away
She said the word I longed to hear her say
I tenderly caressed her
Close to my heart I pressed her
Upon that golden yesterday
I found my love in Avalon beside the bay
I left my love in Avalon and sailed away
I dream of her and Avalon from dusk till dawn
And so I think Ill travel on
To AvalonI always thought that Id prefer single-blessed-ness
Thought that Id like to stay free
I never thought my time would come to marry
No wedding bells for me Ive changed my mind after all
You are the one made me fall for
I used to smile at all the songs that were popular
Nothing but love in each song
I used to think those kind of songs were foolish
Now I admit Im wrong
Love songs are part of my plan show me the minister man for
I never knew I could love anybody
Honey like Im loving you
I couldnt realize what a pair of eyes and a baby smile could do
I cant sleep I cant eat
I never knew a single soul could be so sweet
I never knew I could love anybody
Honey like Im loving youThe best of everything thats that is what I wish you all
The best of everything a Rembrandt hanging on your the wall
A yacht that wins you cups skateboards with style and speed
Show dogs or loving pups the pride of the pound or the pedigreed
I hope you win that prize pass that blue ribbon test
I hope your good keeps getting better til your betters best
With every wine you taste with every song you sing
By now you may have guest I hope you get the best of everythingThe night is bitter the stars have lost their glitter
The winds grow colder suddenly youre a lot older
And all because of a gal who got away
No more her eager call the writing is on the wall
All those dreams you dreamed they have all gone astray
The gal who won you shes run off and undone you
That great beginning has seen the final inning
I dont know what happened its all a crazy game
No more - no more that all time thrill because you have been put though the mill
And never a new love will ever be the same
Good riddance good-bye
Every trick of hers you are on to
But fools will be fools and wheres she gone
Where has she gone

Is its the baddest part of town
And if you youre gonna go down there you better just beware
Of a man cat named Leroy Brown
Now Leroy Brown hes trouble
And he stands about six-feet-four
All the downtown ladies call him treetop lover
The studs they call him sir
Chorus
Yeah hes bad bad Leroy Brown
Meanest baddest man cat in the whole damn town
Badder than old King Kong
And hes meaner than a junkyard dog
Now Leroy hes a gambler
And he likes digs his those fancy clothes
He likes to wave his that great big big fat shiny diamond ring
Under in front of everybodys nose
Hes got a custom Continental
Hes got an Eldorado too
Hes got a twenty-two thirty-two gun in his pocket for fun
Hes got a razor in his the razor in the shoe
Chorus
Now Friday bout a week ago
Leroy shootin dice
And at the end edge of the bar sat was a lady chick named Dorris Morris
Man she sure looked nice
And well then he laid his eyes upon her
Thats when the big scene trouble soon began
And Leroy Brown he learned a lesson bout messin
With the wife of a jealous man
ChorusWhat is America to me
A name a map or a flag I see
A certain word democracy
What is America to me
The house I live in
A plot of Earth a street
The grocer and the butcher
And the people that I meet
The children in the playground
The faces that I see
All races and religions
Thats America to me
The place I work in
The worker by my side
The little town the city
Where my people lived and died
The howdy and the handshake
The air a feeling free
And the right to speak your mind out
Thats America to me
The things I see about me
The big things and the small
The little corner newsstand
Or the house a mile tall
The wedding and the churchyard
The laughter and the tears
The dream thats been a growing
For a hundred and fifty years
The town I live in
The street the house the room
The pavement of the city
Or the garden all in bloom
The church the school the clubhouse
The million lights I see
But especially the people
Thats America to meAutumn in New York
Why does it seem so inviting
Autumn in New York
It spells the thrill of first-knighting
Glittering crowds and shimmering clouds
In canyons of steel
Theyre making me feel Im home
Its autumn in New York
That brings the promise of new love
Autumn in New York
Is often mingled with pain
Dreamers with empty hands
They sigh for exotic lands
Its autumn in New York
Its good to live it again
This autumn in New York
Transforms the slums into Mayfair
Autumn in New York
Youll need no castles in Spain
Lovers that bless the dark
On benches in Central Park
Its autumn in New York
Its good to live it againHey drink up all you people
Order anything you see
And have fun you happy people
The drink and the laughs on me
Try to think that loves not around
Still its uncomfortably near
My old heart aint gaining any ground
Because my angel eyes aint here
Angel eyes that old Devil sent
They glow unbearably bright
Need I say that my loves misspent
Misspent with angel eyes tonight
So drink up all of you people
Order anything you see
And have fun you happy people
The drink and the laughs on me
Pardon me but I got to run
The facts uncommonly clear
I got to find whos now the number one
And why my angel eyes aint here
Excuse me while I disappearMy story is much too sad to be told
But practically everything leaves me totally cold
The only exception I know is the case
When Im out on a quiet spree
Fighting vainly the old ennui
And I suddenly turn and see your fabulous face
I get no kick from champagne
Mere alcohol doesnt thrill me at all
So tell me why should it be true
That I get a kick out of you
Some they may go for a cocaine
Im sure that if I took even one sniff
It would bore me terrifically too
Yet I get a kick out of you
I get a kick every time I see you
Standing there before me
I get a kick though its clear to see
You obviously do not adore meinstrumentalFly me to the moon
and let me play among the stars
Let me see what love is like
on Jupiter and Mars
In other words
hold my hand
In other words
darling kiss me
Fill my heart with song
and let me sing for evermore
You are all I think about
all I worship and adore
In other words

Ive Got A Crush On You
Frank
Ive got a crush on you sweetie pie
All the day and night-time hear me sigh
I never had the least notion
That I could fall with so much emotion
Barbra
I wonder Could you coo now could you care
For a cozy cottage we could share
The world will pardon my mush
Cause I have got a crush my baby on you
Barbra Ive got a crush on you
Frank Ive got a crush on you
Barbra Sweetie pie
Frank Sweetie pie
Barbra All the day and night-time
Frank All the day and night-time
Barbra Hear me sigh
Frank Hear me sigh
Both I never had the least notion
Frank That I could fall with
Barbra Id fall with
Frank So much
Barbra So much emotion
Frank So much emotion
Could you coo
Barbra I could coo
Frank Could you possibly care
Barbra I could care
Frank For a lovely cottage
Barbra Ooo that cottage
Both That we could share
The world will pardon my mush
Frank Yes I have got a crush my Barbra on you
Barbra You will make me blush Francis
Frank Yes
Both I have got a crush my baby on youAnd now the end is here
And so I face the final curtain
My friend Ill say it clear
Ill state my case of which Im certain
Ive lived a life thats full
I traveled each and evry highway
And more much more than this I did it my way
Regrets Ive had a few
But then again too few to mention
I did what I had to do and saw it through without exemption
I planned each charted course each careful step along the byway
And more much more than this I did it my way
Yes there were times Im sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall and did it my way
Ive loved Ive laughed and cried
Ive had my fill my share of losing
And now as tears subside I find it all so amusing
To think I did all that
And may I say not in a shy way
Oh no oh no not me I did it my way
For what is a man what has he got
If not himself then he has naught
To say the things he truly feels and not the words of one who kneels
The record shows I took the blows and did it my wayIve got the world on a string
Im sitting on a rainbow
Got the string around my finger
What a world what a life Im in love
Ive got a song that I sing
I can make the rain go
Anytime I move my finger
Lucky me cant you see Im in love
Lifes a wonderful thing
As long as I hang on to the string
Id be a silly so and so
If I should ever let it go
You didnt go dont you know you can never let go
Got the world on a string
Sittin on a rainbow
Got the string around my finger
What a world what a life Im in love
Lifes a wonderful thing
Life is a wonderful thing
Long as I hang on to the string
Id be a silly so and so
Id be a silly so and so
If I should ever let it go
Let go let it go
Ive got the world on a string
And Ive sitting on a rainbow
Got that string around my finger
What a world
What a world
There aint no other world like
There aint no public life
Hey noCome fly with me lets fly lets fly away
If you can use some exotic booze
Theres a bar in far Bombay
Come on fly with me well float down in the blue
Fly with me float down to Peru
In llama land theres a one-man band
And hell toot his flute for you
Fly with me well take off in the blue
Once I get you up there where the air is rarefied
Well just glide starry-eyed
Once I get you up there Ill be holding you so very near
You might even hear a gang of angels cheer just because were together
Weather-wise its such a cool cool day
You just say those words well whip those birds down to Acapulco Bay
It is perfect for a flying honeymoon they do say
Come on and fly with me lets fly lets fly away
Once I get you up there where the air is so rarefied
Were gonna glide absolutely starry-eyed
Once I get you up there Ill be holding you so very near
You might even hear a gang of angels cheer just because were together
Weather-wise its such a groovy day
You just say those words well whip those birds down to Acapulco Bay
Its perfect for a flying honeymoon they do say
Come on fly with me lets fly lets fly
Pack up your bags and lets get out of here
Come on lets fly awayOnce I could see once I could feel
Now I am numb and Ive become unreal
I walk the night without a goal
Stripped of my heart and my soul
What now my love what now my love now that youve left me
How can I live how can I live through another day
Watching my dreams turning into ashes
And all of my hopes all of my hopes into bits of clay
Once I could see once I could feel
Now I am numb and Ive become unreal
I walk through the night without a goal
Stripped of my my heart and my soul
What now my love what now what now
What now what now now that its over
What now what now what now what now
I feel the whole world falling all around me
Here comes the stars falling around me
Theres the sky where the earth ought to be
What now my love now that youre gone
Id be a fool to go on and on and on
And on and on and on and on and on and on on
No one would care nobodys gonna cry
If he should live live or die
What now my love now there is nothing
Only my last my last goodbye my last goodbyeA foggy day in London town
Had me low and it had me down
I viewed the morning with much alarm
The British museum had lost its charm
How long I wondered could this thing last
But the age of miracles it hadnt past
For suddenly I saw you standing right there
And in foggy London town the sun was shining
It was shining everywhere
How long I wondered could this thing last
But the age of miracles it hadnt past
For suddenly I saw you standing right there
And in foggy London town the sun was shining everywhereFrank
The torch I carry is handsome
Its worth its heartache in ransom
Now when that twilight steals
I know how the lady in the harbor feels
Both
When I want rain I get sunny weather
Im just as blue
Frank
Blue as the sky
Both
Since love has gone cant get myself together
Frank
Guess Ill hang my tears out to dry

Carly
You lie you awake and think about the boy
Frank
I hang around at home and ask myself Where is she
Both
Guess Ill hang my tears out to dry
Both
Dry little tear drops my little tear drops
Frank
Moving on a string of dreams
My little memories those little memories
Remind her of our crazy schemes
Carly
When your lonely heart has learned its lesson
Frank
Then somebody said just forget about her
Carly
Youd be his if only he would call
Frank
And I gave that treatment a try
Carly
In the wee small hours
Frank
Strangely enough I got along without her
Both
Then one day heshe passed me right by - oh well
Both
I guess Ill hang my tears out to dry
Carly Thats the time you missed her most of all
Frank tears out to dryEydie

Wont go to Harlem in ermine and pearls
Wont dish the dirt with the rest of the girls
Thats why the lady is a tramp
She likes the free fresh wind in her hair
Life without care
Shes broke and its oke
Hates California its cold and its damp
Thats why the lady is a tramp
She gets too hungry to wait for dinner at eight
She loves the theater but never comes late
Shed never bother with people shed hate

Shell have no crap games with sharpies and frauds
And she wont go to Harlem in Lincolns or Fords

No they cant take that away from me
We may never never meet again on that bumpy road to love
But Ill always always keep the memory of
The way you hold your knife
The way we danced till three
The way you changed my life
No they cant take that away from meStart spreading the news

these nights

You make me feel like spring has sprung
Every time I see you grin
Such a happy individual
The moment that you speak
I want to run and play hide and seek
I wanna go and bounce the moon
Just like a toy balloon
You and I
Were just like a couple of tots
Running around the meadow
Pickin up all those forget-me-nots
You make me feel so young
You make me feel there are songs to be sung
Bells to be rung
And a wonderful fling to be flung
And even when Im old and gray
Im gonna to feel the way I do today
Because you make me feel so young
You make me young
You make me think that spring has sprung
Every time I see you grin
Im such a coo coo individual
The moment that you speak
I like to run and play hide and seek
I like to go and bounce the moon
Just like a big balloon
Because you and I
We are just like a couple of tots
Who are running around the meadow
Snatching up all those forget-me-nots
You make me young
You make me feel there are songs to be sung
Like bells to be rung
And a wonderful fling to be flung
And even when Im old and gray
Im going feel the way I do today
Because you make me feel so
Man I just feel so
You make me feel so young
So youngfor once in my life i have someone who needs me
Someone ive needed so long
For once unafraid i can go where life leads me
And somehow i know ill be strong
For once i can touch what my heart used to dream of
Long before i knew
Someone warm like you
Would make my dreams come true
For once in my life i wont let sorrow hurt me
Not like it hurt me before
For once i have something i know wont desert me
Im not alone anymore
For once i can say this is mine you cant take it
As long as i know i have love i can make it
For once in my life i have someone who needs meThe summer wind came blowin in
From across the sea
It lingered there to touch your hair
And walk with me
All summer long we sang a song
And then we strolled that golden sand
Two sweethearts
And the summer wind
Like painted kites
Those days and nights they went flyin by
The world was new
Beneath a blue umbrella sky
Then softer than a piper man
One day it called to you
I lost you I lost you
To the summer wind
The autumn wind and the winter winds
They have come and gone
And still the days those lonely days
They go on and on
And guess who sighs his lullabies
Through nights that never end
My fickle friend the summer wind
The summer wind warm summer wind the summer windHello young lovers whoever you are
I hope your troubles are few
All my good wishes go with you tonight
Ive been in love like you
Be brave young lovers and follow your star
Be brave and faithful and true
Cling very close to each other tonight
Ive been in love like you
I know how it feels to have wings on your heels
And to fly down the street in a trance
You fly down a street on a chance that youll meet
And you meet not really by chance
Dont cry young lovers whatever you do
Dont cry because Im alone
All of my memries are happy tonight
Ive had a love of my ownThat year in Oakland High
When I was seventeen
The grass from there to San Jose
Was high and cool and green
I see it now
Too brash and young was I
To know what time could mean
The old Acacia lawn cut down
Was felt but never seen
I see it now
That world I knew is lost to me
Loves have come and gone
The years go racing by
I live as best I can
And all at once I know
It means the making of a man
I see it now
I see it now
I see it nowHow old am I Im old enough to know
The difference between infatuation
And a love that has a chance to grow
How old am I Im not too old to hear
The sweet ring of truth and understanding
When the words I love you reach my ear
Dont mind these lines beneath my eyes
Theyre well earned souvenirs
Of a thousand nights of laughter
And occasional tears
And I hope you wont be jealous
Of the silver in my hair
It took many lovers quarrels
To put it there
How old am I you kiss me and Im young
Loves a road never traveled
Lifes a song Ive never sung
If I make you happy today
Im the perfect age
As for tomorrow turn the pageYou are the summer and I am the autumn
Dont wait too long
Your songs beginning while mines nearly sung
Dont wait too long
Fall is a lovely time of the year
When leaves turn to golden brown
But soon fall is ending and winter is near
And the leaves start tumblin down
Why must the moments go by in such haste
Dont wait too long
Winter is coming Ive no time to waste
Dont wait too long
So while my hearts gay and foolish
And free and still can sing its song
Share every precious moment with me
Dont you wait too long
Dont wait too long
Dont wait too long
So while my hearts gay and foolish
And free and still can sing its song
Share every precious moment with me
Dont you wait too longI get along without you very well
Of course I do
Except when soft rains fall
And drip from leaves then I recall
The thrill of being sheltered in your arms
Of course I do
But I get along without you very well
Ive forgotten you just like I should
Of course I have
Except to hear your name
Or someones laugh that is the same
But Ive forgotten you just like I should
What a guy what a fool am I
To think my breaking heart could kid the moon
Whats in store should I phone once more
No its best that I stick to my tune
I get along without you very well
Of course I do
Except perhaps in spring
But I should never think of spring
For that would surely break my heart in twoDream away child let your dreams run wild
Or a lifetime of worries might claim you
Dream away child let your dreams run wild
Or the years and the tears shed might claim you
For the last time we have tasted
Loves sweet tears by the fires glow
If our hearts are strong therell be
No long good-byes when its time to go
But the strongest torch is sometimes broken
As the deepest vows arent always spoken
And the greatest wounds we hide inside ourselves
Where they never show
Dream away child let your dreams run wild
Or a lifetime of worries might claim you
Dream away child let your dreams run wild
Or the years and the tears shed might claim you
When the Winter weds the Northern Wind
The child they bear is snow
And the branches bow like worried bridesmaids
But the trees will grow
Sun and Earth in time will come together
God will give us back our summer weather
But the memries of that first sweet
Taste of love pass away so slow
Dream away child let your dreams run wild
Or a lifetime of worries might claim you
Dream away child let your dreams run wild
Or the years and the tears shed might claim you
When theres no room left to live inside ourselves
Do we dream awayWhat a day this has been
What a rare mood Im in
Why its almost like being in love
Theres a smile on my face
For the whole human race
Why its almost like being in love
All the music of life seems to be
Like a bell that is ringing for me
And from the way that I feel
When that bell starts to peal
I would swear I was falling
I could swear I was falling
Its almost like being in love
All the music of life seems to be
Like a bell that is ringing for me
And from the way that I feel
When that bell starts to peal
I would swear that Im falling
I could swear I was falling
Its almost like being in loveBaubles bangles hear how they jing jinga-linga
Baubles bangles bright shiny beads
Sparkles spangles your heart will sing singa-linga
Wearin baubles bangles and beads
Youll glitter and gleam so
Make somebody dream so that
Some day he may buy you a ring ringa-linga
Ive heard thats where it leads
Wearin baubles bangles and beads
instrumental
Baubles bangles hear how they jing jinga-linga
Baubles bangles all those bright shiny beads
Sparkles spangles your heart will sing singa-linga
Wearin baubles bangles and beads
Youll youll glitter and gleam so
Youre gonna make somebody dream so that

Ive heard that thats where it leads
If youre wearin baubles bangles	and them cool cool beadsIf you are but a dream
I hope I never waken
Its more than I could bear
To find that Im forsaken
If youre a fantasy
Then Im content to be
In love with lovely you
And pray my dream comes true
I long to kiss you
But I would not dare
Im so afraid that
You may vanish in the air
So darling
If our romance would break up
I hope I never wake up
If you are but a dream
I long to kiss you
But I would not dare
Im so afraid that
You may vanish in the air
So darling
If our romance would break up
I hope I never wake up
If you are but a dreamMy eyes are dry my love since youve been gone I havent shed a tear
Ill never cry my love though every day seems like a hundred years
For Im just a fool who clings to his pride but when Im alone
I can hear the sound of rain in my heart of the tears that I hide
And it tears me apart cause I keep them inside
I cant get away from the sound of the rain in my heart
How could I know my love I was a toy only a game to you
How could you go my love without a thought of what Im going through
How can I forget I still love you so it echoes each time that I hear
The sound of rain in my heart from the tears that I hide
So it tears me apart I still keep them inside
But I cant escape from the sound of the rain in my heart
I hear that rain in my heart of the tears that I hide
And it tears me apart cause I keep them inside
music fadesIn the night though were apart
Theres a ghost of you within my haunted heart
Ghost of you my lost romance
Lips that laugh eyes that dance
Haunted heart wont let me be
Dreams repeat a sweet but lonely song to me
Dreams are dust its you who must belong to me
And thrill my haunted heart
Be still my haunted heartLost in day to day
Turn another way
With a laugh
A kind hello
Some small talk
With those I know
I forget
That Im not over you
For a while
A wave an easy grin
A smile to put them in
With other lives
To listen to
And some work
Ive got to do
I forget
That Im not over you
For a while
Days go by
With no empty feeling
Until I
Remember youre gone
People say to me
You need company
When you have
Some time to spend
Drop around
And meet a friend
They forget
That Im not over you
For a while
They forget
That Im not over you
For a whileLullaby and good night with roses bestride
With lilies bedecked neath babys sweet bed
May thou sleep may thou rest may thy slumber be blest
May thou sleep may thou rest may thy slumber be blest
Lullaby and good night thy mothers delight
Bright angels around my darling shall guard
They will guide thee from harm thou art safe in my arms
They will guide thee from harm thou art safe in my arms
Guten abend gut nacht mit rosen bedacht
Mit nglein besteckt schlpf unter die deck
Morgen frh wenn got will wirst du wieder geweckt
Morgen frh wenn got will wirst du wieder geweckt
Guten abend gut nacht von englein bewacht
Die zeigen in traum dir christkindleins baum
Schlaf num selig und suss schau in traums paradies
Schlaf num selig und suss schau in traums paradies
Good evening good night covered with roses
With tiny fingernails hidden slipping under the blankets
Tomorrow morning if God wills you will wake again
Tomorrow morning if God wills you will wake again
God evening good night watched over by tiny angels
Who show the little Christ childs tree in dreams
Sleep now blessed and sweet look at dreams paradise
Sleep now blessed and sweet look at dreams paradiseBlack cats creep across my path
Until Im almost mad
I must have roused the Devils wrath
Cause all my luck is bad
I make a date for golf
And you can bet your life it rains
I try to give a party
But the guy upstairs complains
I guess Ill go thru life
Just catchin colds and missin trains
Everything happens to me
I never miss a thing
Ive had the measles and the mumps
And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
I guess Im just a fool
Who never looks before he jumps
Everything happens to me
At first my heart thought
You could break this jinx for me
That love would turn
The trick to end despair
But now I just cant fool
This head that thinks for me
So Ive mortgaged
All my castles in the air
Ive telegraphed and phoned
Sent an Air Mail Special too
You answer was goodbye
There was even postage due
I fell in love just once
And then it had to be with you
Everything happens to me
Ive never drawn a sweepstake
Or a bank night at a show
I thought perhaps this time
Id won but Lady Luck said no
And though it breaks my heart
Im not surprised to see you go
Everything happens to me
Everything happens to meI get along without you very well
Of course I do
Except when soft rains fall
And drip from leaves then I recall
The thrill of being sheltered in your arms
Of course I do
But I get along without you very well
Ive forgotten you just like I should
Of course I have
Except to hear your name
Or someones laugh that is the same
But Ive forgotten you just like I should
What a guy what a fool am I
To think my breaking heart could kid the moon
Whats in store should I phone once more
No its best that I stick to my tune
I get along without you very well
Of course I do
Except perhaps in spring
But I should never think of spring
For that would surely break my heart in twoIf I lived the past over saw today from yesterday
I would be in love anyway
If I knew that youd leave me if I knew you wouldnt stay
I would be in love anyway
Sometimes I think think about before
Sometime I think if I knew then what I know now
I dont believe Id ever change somehow
Though youll never be with me and there are no words to say
Ill still be in love anyway
If I knew then what I know now I dont believe Id ever change
Somehow if I knew then what I know now
I dont believe Id ever change somehowGranada Im falling under your spell
And if you could speak what a fascinating tale you would tell
Of an age the world has long forgotten
Of an age that weaves a silent magic in Granada today
The dawn in the sky greets the day with a sigh for Granada
For she can remember the splendor that once was Granada
It still can be found in the hills all around as I wander along
Entranced by the beauty before me
Entranced by a land full of flowers and song
When day is done and the sun touch the sea in Granada
I envy the blush of the snow-clad Tierra Novada
Soon it will welcome the stars
While a thousand guitars play a soft carbinera
Then moonlit Granada will live again
The glory of yesterday romantic and gay
And soon it will welcome the stars
While a thousand guitars play a soft carbinera
Then moonlit Granada will live again
The glory of yesterday romantic gay GranadaJust a melancholy echo
Ling ring when the day is through
Its the call of the canyon
Once again Im dreaming of you
Every night I search the moonlight
Up and down the river shore
Its the call of the canyon
Maybe I will find you once more
Standing there alone by the ashes
Of the fire we said would never die
Will I ever find an ember
Burning from the days gone by
Then I hear a lonely whisper
As a little spark I see
Its the call of the canyon
Bringing back your answer to me
Standing there alone by the ashes
Of the fire we said would never die
Will I ever find an ember
Burning from the days gone by
Then I hear a lonely whisper
As a little spark I see
Its the call of the canyon
Bringing back your answer to meMy story is much too sad to be told
But practically everything leaves me totally cold
The only exception I know is the case
When Im out on a quiet spree
Fighting vainly the old ennui
And I suddenly turn and see your fabulous face
I get no kick from champagne
Mere alcohol doesnt thrill me at all
So tell me why should it be true
That I get a kick out of you
Some they may go for a cocaine
Im sure that if I took even one sniff
It would bore me terrifically too
Yet I get a kick out of you
I get a kick every time I see you
Standing there before me
I get a kick though its clear to see
You obviously do not adore meI tried
Tried to impress you
My love
I gave it all
Each hour ever at your beck and call
I tried
Tried to caress you
My soul
Filled with desire
Two arms craving the one I admire
Your charm was so appealing
I loved you from the start
Theres still that same old feeling
Concealed here in my heart
I tried making you love me
And you couldnt decide
But Ill never regret that I tried
And tried and triedIm gettin married in the morning
Ding-dong the bells are gonna chime
Well have a whopper pull out the stopper
Get me to the church on time
Ive got to get there in the morning
Spruced up and lookin in my prime
Pull out your compass kick up a rompass
Get me to the church on time
If I am dancing roll up the floor
If I am whistling out the door
Im gettin married in the morning
Ding-ding-dong theyre gonna chime
Girls come and kiss me say that youll miss me
Get me to the church on timeIts not that easy bein green
Having to spend each day the color of the leaves
When I think it could be nicer bein red or yellow or gold
Or something much more colorful like that
Its not easy bein green
It seems you blend in with so many other ordinary things
And people tend to pass you over cause youre
Not standin out like flashy sparkles on the water
Or stars in the sky
But green is the color of spring
And green can be cool and friendly-like
And green can be big like an ocean
Or important like a mountain
Or tall like a tree
When green is all there is to be
It could make you wonder why
But why wonder why wonder
I am green and itll do fine
Its beautiful
And I think its what I want to be
instrumental
And green can be big like an ocean
Or important like a mountain
Or tall like a tree
When green is all there is to be
It could make you wonder why
But why wonder why wonder
I am green and itll do fine
Its beautiful
And I think its what I want to beIs it an earthquake or simply a shock
Is it the good turtle soup or merely the mock
Is it a cocktail this feeling of joy
Or is what i feel the real McCoy
Is it for all time or simply a lark
Is it Granada i see or only Asbury Park
Is it a fancy not worth thinking of
Or is it at long last love
Is it an earthquake or simply a shock
Is it the good turtle soup or is it merely the mock
Is it a cocktail this feeling of joy
Or is what i feel the real McCoy
Is it for all time or simply a lark
Is it Granada i see or only Asbury Park
Is it a fancy not worth thinking of
Or is it at long long long last loveMake like a Mister Milquetoast and youll get shut out
Make like a Mister Meek and youll get cut out
Make like a little lamb and wham youre shorn
I tell ya chum its time to come blow your horn
Make like a Mister Mumbles and youre a zero
Make like a Mister Big they dig a hero
Youve got to sound your A the day youre born
I tell ya chum its time to come blow your horn
The taller the tree is the sweeter the peach
Ill give you the whole maguilla in a one word speach Reach
Make like the worlds your pudding but light the brandy
Even the mildest kiss is a dan dan dandy
Therell be no love in bloom come doomsday morn
I tell ya chum its time to come blow your horn
Interlude
In civilized jungles females adore
The lions who come on swingin if you want to score - roar
You can be either read to or be the reader
You can be either lead or be the leader
Dont wait until youre told youre old and worn
Take in some air and get your lips puckered
Before you find youre simply too tuckered
Ill tell ya chum its time to come blow your horn
Blow your horn
I tell ya chum its time to come blow your hornHeres to those who love not too wisely know not wisely but too well
To the girl who sighs with envy when she hears that wedding bell
To the guy whod throw a party if he knew someone to call
Heres to the losers bless them all
Heres to those who drink their dinners when that lady doesnt show
To the girl wholl wait for kisses underneath that mistletoe
To the lonely summer lovers when the leaves begin to fall
Heres to the losers a-bless them all
Hey Tom Dick and Harry come in out of the rain
Those torches you carry must be drowned in champagne
Heres the last toast of the evening heres to those who still believe
All the losers will be winners all the givers shall receive
Heres to trouble-free tomorrows may your sorrows all be small
Heres to the losers bless them all
MUSICAL INTERLUDE
Hey Tom Dick and Harry come in out of that rain

Heres to trouble-free tomorrows may your sorrows all be small
Heres to the losers heres to the losers heres to the losers
Bless them allSo you met someone who set you back on your heals - goody goody
You met someone and now you know how it feels - goody goody
You gave him your heart too
Just as I gave mine to you
And he broke it in little pieces
Now how do you do
You lie awake just singing the blues all night - goody goody
And you think that loves a barrel of dynamite
Hooray and hallelujah
You had it coming to ya
Goody goody for him goody goody for me
I hope your satisfied you rascal you
I hope your satisfied cause you got yoursSome like a night at the movies some like a dance or a show
Some are content with an evening spent home by the radio
Some like to live for the moment some like to just reminisce
But whenever I have an evening to spend just give me one like this
This is a lovely way to spend an evening cant think of anything Id rather do
This is a lovely way to spend an evening cant think of anyone as lovely as you
A casual stroll through a garden a kiss by a lazy lagoon
Catching a breath of moonlight humming our favorite tune
This is a lovely way to spend an evening
I want to save all my nights and spend them with you
Catching a breath of moonlight humming our favorite tune
This is a lovely way to spend an evening
I want to save all my nights and spend them with youHear my song Violetta hear the song thats in my heart
Please be mine Violetta say that we will never part
Every night Im dreaming of you
Every night I want to whisper Dear I love you
Hear my song Violetta hear the song thats in my heartThe falling leaves
Drift by the window
The autumn leaves
Of red and gold
I see your lips
The summer kisses
The sunburned hands
I used to hold
Since you went away
The days grow long
And soon Ill hear
Old winters song
But I miss you most of all
My darling
When autumn leaves
Start to fallOh they say some people long ago
Were searching for a different tune
One that they could croon
As only they can
They only had the rhythm
So they started swaying to and fro
They didnt know just what to use
That is how the blues really began
They heard the breeze in the trees
Singing weird melodies
And they made that the start of the blues
And from a jail came the wail
Of a down-hearted frail
And they played that
As part of the blues
From a whippoorwill
Out on a hill
They took a new note
Pushed it through a horn
Til it was worn
Into a blue note
And then they nursed it rehearsed it
And gave out the news
That the Southland gave birth to the bluesIn olden days a glimpse of stocking
Was looked on as something shocking
Now heaven knows anything goes
Good authors too who once knew better words
Now only use four letter words writing prose
Anything goes
The world has gone mad today
And goods bad today
And blacks white today
And days night today
When most guys today that women prize today
Are just silly gigolos
So though Im not a great romancer
I know that youre bound to answer
When I propose anything goes
In olden days a glimpse of stocking
Was looked on as something shocking
Now heaven knows anything goes
And good authors too who once knew better words
Now only use four letter words writing prose
Cause anything goes
The world has gone mad today
And goods bad today
And blacks white today
And days night today
When most guys today that women prize today
Are just silly gigolos
So though Im not a great romancer
I know that youre bound to answer
When I propose anything goes
May I say before this record spins to a close
I want you to know anything goesJule Styne Susan Birkenhead
Recorded September ten one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-one New York
Hey look no crying though she has one foot out the door
I should be crying it ought to hurt a little more
I should resent her try to prevent her whatever for Hey look I knew it shes not the type to hang around
Some day she was bound to go
With that fact in mind my tears were never apropos
Hey look no sorrow I have been luckier than most
And if tomorrow I still feel haunted by her ghost
I will remember how I loved her and how it was
Who needs crying With those memories in tow
Me Im flying I got memories to show
Hey look no crying
Just Goodbye Im letting goI cover the waterfront Im watching the sea
Will the one I love be coming back to me
I cover the waterfront in search of my love
And Im covered by a starless sky above
Here am I patiently waiting hoping and longing
Oh how I yearn Where are you Are you forgetting
Do you remember Will you return
I cover the waterfront Im watching the sea
For the one I love must soon come back to meAnything can make me happy
Any little thing youll do
You just have to raise your finger
And the stars will linger in the blue
When you turn your smile on
Thrill just seems to pile on
If I hear your laughter tears can follow after
Anything will make me happy
Just as long as you love meHey Jealous lover
Youre acting so strange
Hey Jealous lover
What is making you change
Hey Jealous lover
How wrong can you be
Im yours ever faithful
Just be faithful to me
I am just as steady as that clock on the shelf
Maybe youre accusing me of what youre doing yourself
Hey Jealous lover
Im telling you true
I know that youre jealous
But theres no one but you
Could have cheated lots of times but just couldnt do
I was much to busy baby being faithful to you
Hey Jealous lover
Im telling you true
I know that youre jealous
But theres no one but you
No one for me jealous lover but youI was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had the feeling of self-pity
What to do
What to do
What to do
The outlook was decidedly blue
But as I walked through the dreary streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day Ive known
A foggy day
In London town
It had me low
And it had me down
I viewed the morning
With much alarm
The British Museum
Had lost its charm
How long I wondered
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles
It hadnt past
For suddenly
I saw you standing right there
And in foggy London town
The sun was shining shining shining shining shining everywhere
How long I wondered
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles
It hadnt past
For suddenly
I saw you standing right there
And in foggy London town
The sun was shining everywhereIve got my eyes on you so best beware where you roam
Ive got my eyes on you so dont stray too far from home
Incidentally Ive set my spies on you
Im checking all you do from a to zee
So darling just be wise keep your eyes on meWere going through the impatient years
The years when the day seems twice as long
Restless and sighing and laughing and crying
And dreaming a dream people say is wrong
But well journey through the impatient years
To each others arms where we belong clinging together
Im certain well weather the warm and stormy day and impatient year
But well journey through the impatient years
To each others arms where we belong clinging together
Im certain well weather the warm and stormy day and impatient yearIs there a chance
Is there a chance for me
Is there some room in your heart
Is there a place for me
Is there a way
Some way that I could thrill you
Some other word I might say
Something that I could do
There could be sunshine
And so much gladness
Without you darling
Im filled with sadness
So is there a chance
Our love affair will be
More than a passing romance
Is there a chance for me
Is there a chance
Is there a chance for me
Is there some room in your heart
Is there a place for me
Is there a way
Some way that I might thrill you
Some other word I might say
Something that I could do
There could be sunshine
And so much gladness
Without you darling
Im filled with sadness
Tell me is there a chance
Our love affair will be
More than a passing romance
Is there a chance for me just a chance for me
Is there a chance for meThat certain night the night we met
There was magic abroad in the air
There were angels dining at the Ritz
And a nightingale sang in Berkley Square
I may be right I may be wrong
But Im perfectly willing to swear
That when you turned and smiled at me
A nightingale sang in Berkley Square
The moon that lingered over London town
Poor puzzled moon he wore a frown
How could he know we two were so in love
The whole darn world seemed upside down
The streets of town were paved with stars
It was such a romantic affair
And as we kissed and said goodnight
A nightingale sang in Berkley Square
The streets of town were paved with stars
It was such a romantic affair
And as we kissed and said goodnight
A nightingale sang in Berkley Square
I know cause I was there
That night in Berkley SquareIndiscreet - its indiscreet
To gaze at you - each time we meet
Ive told my eyes - they must disguise - this yearning
Yes its indiscreet - quite indiscreet
To find your touch - so bitter sweet
Youre close to me and suddenly Im burning
While I ask myself Where is your pride
Irresistibly Im drawn to your side
And Yes its indiscreet - so indiscreet
But love is swift - and time is sweet
And oh my dear - I crave the nearness of you
To love you is why my heart must be
So love me - it cant be indiscreetStarry night this is the fable of the rose
The rose I gave my love
So young and tender so in bloom
Filled with a faint perfume
Is lying crushed and faded in a room
Starry night this is the fable of the rose
The rose I gave my love
Beyond all dreams of her caress
I may as well confess
She only loved me slightly maybe less
Yet her smile so strangely haunts me
All the thrill of it taunts me
And so it goes the fable of the roseINTRO
Youre completely unaware dear that my heart is in your hand
So for loves sake wont you listen and try to understand
I dream of you more than you dream I do
How can I prove to you this love is real
You mean to me more than you mean to be
You just cant seem to see the way I feel
When I am close to you the world is far away
The words that fill my heart my lips cant seem to say
I want you so more than youll ever know
More than you dream I do I dream of youMaybe
I should have saved
Those leftover dreams
Funny
But heres that rainy day
Heres that rainy day
They told me about
And I laughed at the thought
That it might turn out this way
Where is that worn out wish
That I threw aside
After it brought my love so near
Funny how love becomes
A cold rainy day
Funny
That rainy day is here
Its funny
How love becomes
A cold rainy day
Funny
That rainy day is hereFirst the tide rushes in
Plants a kiss on the shore
Then rolls out to sea
And the sea is very still once more
So I rush to your side
Like the oncoming tide
With one burning thought
Will your arms open wide
At last were face to face
And as we kiss through an embrace
I can tell I can feel
You are love you are real
Really mine
In the rain in the dark in the sun
Like the tide at its ebb
Im at peace in the web
Of your armsBaby wont you please come home
Cause your daddys all alone
I have tried in vain
Never no more to call your name
When you left you broke my heart
Because I never thought wed part
Every hour in the day
You will hear me sayIf they asked me I could write a book
About the way you walk and whisper and look
I could write a preface on how we met
So the world would never forget
And the simple secret of the plot
Is just to tell them that I love you a lot
Then the world discovers as my book ends
How to make two lovers of friends
And the simple secret of the plot
Is just to tell them that I love you a lot
Then the world discovers as my book ends
How to make two lovers of friendsLook at yourself if you had a sense of humor
You would laugh to beat the band
Look at yourself do you still believe the rumor
That romance is simply grand
Since you took it right on the chin
You have lost that bright toothpaste grin
My mental state is all a-jumble
I sit around and sadly mumble
Fools rush in so here I am
Very glad to be unhappy
I cant win but here I am
More than glad to be unhappy
Unrequited loves a bore
And Ive got it pretty bad
But for someone you adore
Its a pleasure to be sad
Like a straying baby lamb
With no mammy and no pappy
Im so unhappy
But oh so gladThe torch I carry is handsome
Its worth its heartache in ransom
And when that twilight steals
I know how the lady in the harbor feels
When I want rain I get sunny weather
Im just as blue as the sky
Since love has gone I cant put myself together
Guess Ill hang my tears out to dry
Friends ask me out but I tell them Im busy
Must get her get a new alibi
I stay at home and ask myself where is she
Guess Ill hang my tears out to dry
Dry little tear drops my little tear drops
Hanging on a stream of dreams
Fly little memories my little memories
Remind her of our crazy schemesThe world is lyrical
Because a miracle
Has brought my lover to me
Though shes some other place her face I see
At night I creep in bed
And never sleep in bed
But look above in the air
And to my greatest joy my love is there
She dances overhead
On the ceiling near my bed
In my sight
All through the night
I try to hide in vain
Underneath my counterpane
But theres my love
Up there above
I whisper Go away my lover
Its not fair
But Im so grateful to discover
That shes still there
I love my ceiling more
Since it is a dancing floor
Just for my loveI should care I should go around weeping
I should care I should go without sleeping
Strangely enough I sleep well
Except for a dream or two
But then I count my sheep well
Funny how sheep can lull you to sleep
So I should care I should let it upset me
I should care but it just doesnt get me
Maybe I wont find someone as lovely as you
But I should care and I do
I should care but it just doesnt get me
Maybe I wont find someone as lovely as you
But I should care and I do
And I doIda sweet as apple cider
Sweeter than all I know
Come out in the silvry moonlight
Of love well whisper so soft and low
Seems as tho cant live without you
Listen please honey do
Ida I idolize yer
I love you Ida deed I doSome time ago
I wandered down into old mexico
While I was there
I felt romance everywhere
Moon was shining bright
And I could hear laughing voices in the night
Everyone was gay
This was the start of their holiday
It was fiesta down in mexico
And so I stopped a while to see the show
I knew that frenes meant please love me
And I could say frenes
A lovely seorita caught my eye
I stood enchanted as she wandered by
And never knowing that it come from me
I gently sighed frenes
She stopped and raised her eyes to mine
Her lips just pleaded to be kissed
Her eyes were soft as candle-shine
So how was I to resist
And now without a heart to call my own
A greater happiness Ive never known
Because her kisses are for me alone
Who wouldnt say frenes
Bsame tu a m
Bsame igual que mi boca te bes
Dame el frenes
Qui mi locura te di
Quien si no fui yo
Pudo ensearte el camino del amor
Muerto mi altivez
Cuando mi orgullo rodo a tus pies
Quiero que vivas solo para m
Y que tu vayas por donde yo voy
Para que mi alma sea no mas de ti
Bsame con frenes
Dame la luz que tiene tu mirar
Y la ansiedad que entre tus labios vi
Esa locura de vivir y amar
Que es mas que amor frenes
Hay en el beso que te di
Alma piedad corazn
Dime que sabes tu sentir
Lo mismo que siento yo
Quiero que vivas solo para m
Y que tu vayas por donde yo voy
Para que mi alma sea no mas de ti
Bsame con frenesI lost my heart
but what of it
its my mistake
I agree
He can laugh and I love it
although the laughs on me
Im wild again
beguiled again
a simpering
whimpering child again
bewihed
bothered and bewildered am I
I couldnt sleep and I wouldnt sleep
until I could sleep where I shouldnt sleep
bewiched
bothered and bewildered am I
Oh when he speaks
he is seeking words
to get off his chest
horizontally is speaking
he is at his very best
A pill is he
but still hell be
All man and I intend to keep him until hell be
bewiched
bothered and bewildered just like me
After one whole quart of brandy like a daisy I awake
with no Alkaselzer handy I dont even shake
when are not a new sensation
Ive done pretty well I think
But this half pint imitation keeps me on the blink
I have seen a lot
I mean a lot
But now Im like sweet seventeen and
bewichted
bothered and bewildered am I
I will sing to him each spring to him
and wornship the trousers that sing to him
bewiched
bothered and bewildered am I
I lost my heart
Im vexed again
Im perplexed again
thank god
I can be oversexed again
bewichted
bothered and bewildered am I
bewichedIf I should lose you the stars would fall from the sky
If I should lose you leaves would wither and die
The birds in May-time theyd sing a mournful refrain
And I would wander around hating the sound of rain
With you beside me the rose would bloom in the snow
With you beside me no winds of winter would blow
I gave you my love and I was living a dream
But living would seem in vain if I
Hating the rain if I
All is in vain if I
If I ever lost youEmpty saddles in the old corral
Where do ya ride tonight
Are you rounding up the doggies the strays of long ago
Are ya on the trail to Buffalo
Empty saddles in the old corral
Where do ya ride tonight
Are there rustlers on the border or a band of Navajo
Are you heading for the Alamo
Empty guns covered with rust
Where do ya talk tonight
Empty boots covered with dust
Where do ya walk tonight
Empty saddles in the old corral
My tears would be dried tonight
If youll only say Im lonely as ya carry my old pal
Empty saddles in the old corralLately I find myself out gazing at stars
Hearing guitars like someone in love
Sometimes the things I do astound me
Mostly whenever youre around me
Lately I seem to walk as though I had wings
Bump into things like someone in love
Each time I look at you
Im limp as a glove
And feeling like someone in love
Lately I seem to walk as though I had wings
I bump into things like someone in love
Each time I look at you
Im limp as a glove
And feeling like someone in loveHey there cutes put on your dancin boots

Oh yeahGive me five minutes more only five minutes more
Let me stay let me stay in your arms
Here am I begging for only five minutes more
Only five minutes more of your charms
All week long I dreamed about our Saturday date
Dont you know that Sunday morning you can sleep late
Give me five minutes more Here am I begging for only five minutes more
Let me stay let me stay
Let me stay let me stay stay in your armsAre you lonesome tonight
Do you miss me tonight
Are you sorry we drifted apart
Does your memory stray to a brighter sunny day
When I kissed you and called you sweetheart
Do the chairs in your parlor seem empty and bare
Do you gaze at your doorstep and picture me there
Is your heart filled with pain shall I come back again
Tell me dear are you lonesome tonight
I wonder if youre lonesome tonight
You know someone said that the worlds a stage
And each must play a part
Fate had me playing in love you as my sweet heart
Act one was when we met I loved you at first glance
You read your line so cleverly and never missed a cue
Then came act two you seemed to change and you acted strange
And why Ill never know
Honey you lied when you said you loved me
And I had no cause to doubt you
But Id rather go on hearing your lies
Than go on living without you
Now the stage is bare and Im standing there
With emptiness all around
And if you wont come back to me
Then make them bring the curtain down
Is your heart filled with pain shall I come back again
Tell me dear are you lonesome tonightApril skies are in your eyes but darling dont be blue
Dont cry oh honey please dont be that way
Clouds in the sky should never make you feel that way
The rain will bring the violets of may
Tears are in vain so honey please dont be that way
As long as we see it through youll have me ill have you
Sweetheart tomorrow is another day
Dont break my heart oh honey please dont be that way
Dont cry oh honey please dont be that way
Clouds in the sky should never make you feel that way
The rain will bring the violets of may
Tears in vain so honey please dont be that way
As long as we will see it through
Youll have me and ill have you
Sweetheart tomorrow is another day
Dont break my heart nh honey please dont be that way
Dont cry dont cry dont cryBye bye baby
Remember youre my baby
When they give you the eye
Although I know that you care
Wont you write and declare
That though on the loose
You are still on the square
Ill be gloomy
But send that rainbow to me
Then my shadows will fly
Though youll be gone for a while
I know that Ill be
Smiling with my baby
By and by
Bye bye baby so long
Bye bye baby
Just you remember that
Youre my baby when
When they give you the eye
And although we know that you care
You just write and declare
That though on the loose
You are still on the square
Ill be gloomy gloomy
But send that rainbow to me
Then the shadows will fly
Though youll be gone for a while
I know that Ill be smiling
With my baby by and by
Bye bye babyYesterday you came my way
And when you smiled at me
In my heart I felt a thrill you see
That it was love at sight and
I was right to love you as I do
Still I never dreamed that you could love me too
Your eyes of blue your kisses too
I never knew what they could do
I cant believe that youre in love with me
Youre telling evry one I know
Im on your mind each place we go
They cant believe that youre in love with me
I have always placed you far above me
I just cant imagine that you love me
And after all is said and done
To think that Im the lucky one
I cant believe that youre in love with me
Skies are gray Im blue each day
When you are not around
Evry thing goes wrong my dear Ive found
But when youre by my side I fill with pride
For Im so proud of you
It all seems too good to me to all be true
Your eyes of blue your kisses too
I never knew what they could do
I cant believe that youre in love with me
Youre telling evry one I know
Im on your mind each place we go
They cant believe that youre in love with me
I have always placed you far above me
I just cant imagine that you love me
And after all is said and done
To think that Im the lucky one
I cant believe that youre in love with meIll be home for Christmas
You can plan on me
Please have snow and mistletoe
And presents on the tree
Christmas Eve will find me
Where the lovelight gleams
Ill be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams
Ill be home for Christmas
You can plan on me
Please have snow and mistletoe
And presents on the tree
Christmas Eve will find me
Where the lovelight gleams
Ill be home for Christmas
If only in my dreamsI never knew the charm of spring
Never met it face to face
I never knew my heart could sing
Never missed a warm embrace till
April in Paris
Chestnuts in blossom
Holiday tables
Under the trees
April in Paris
This is a feeling
That no one can ever reprise
I never knew the charm of spring
I never met it face to face
And I never knew my heart could sing
Never missed a warm embrace tillI like New York in June how about you
I like a Gershwin tune how about you
I love a fireside when a storm is due
I like potato chips moonlight
Motor trips how about you
Im mad about good books cant get my fill
And James Durantes looks give me a thrill
Holding hands in the movie show
When all the lights are low may not be new
But I like it how about you
I like New York in June how about you
I like a Gershwin tune how about you
I love a fireside when a storm is due how about you
Im mad about good books cant get my fill
And James Durantes looks they give me a thrill
Holding hands in the movie show
When all the lights are low may not be new
But I like it and I like it I like it how about youNever treats me sweet and gentle the way she should
I got it bad and that aint good
My poor heart is sentimental not made of wood
I got it bad and that aint good
But when the weekends over and Monday rolls around
I end up like I start out just cryin my heart out
Doesnt love me like I love her no nobody could
I got it bad and that aint good
Like a lonely weepin willow whos lost in the wood
I got it bad and that aint good
And the things I tell my pillow nobody should
I got it bad I got I bad and its no good
Though folks with good intentions they tell me to save up my tears
Im glad Im mad about her I cant live without her
Lord above make her love me the way that she should
I got it bad and that aint good
I got it bad and that aint good
No good Repeat Maybe
I should have saved
Those leftover dreams
Funny
But heres that rainy day
Heres that rainy day
They told me about
And I laughed at the thought
That it might turn out this way
Where is that worn out wish
That I threw aside
After it brought my love so near
Funny how love becomes
A cold rainy day
Funny
That rainy day is here
Its funny
How love becomes
A cold rainy day
Funny
That rainy day is hereThe days of wine and roses laugh and run away like a child at play
Through the meadow land toward a closing door
A door marked nevermore that wasnt there before
The lone-ly night discloses just a passing breeze filled with memories
Of the golden smile that introduced me to
The days of wine and roses and you
The days of wine and roses
more instrumental-rest of the first verse
The lonely - the night discloses just a passing breeze filled with memories
Of the golden smile that introduced me to
The days of wine and roses and youThere is no great big ending
No sunset in the sky
There is no string ensemble
And she doesnt even cry
And just as I begin to say
That we should make another try
She reaches out across the table looks at me and quietly says good-bye
There is no big explosion
No tempest in the tea
The world does not stop turning round
Theres no big tragedy
Sitting in a coffee shop
With cheesecake and some apple pie
She reaches out across the table looks at me and quietly says good-bye
Good-bye
Said so easily
Good-bye
Said so quietly
Good-bye good-bye good-bye
Just two always strangers avoid each others eyes
One still make believing
One still telling lies
She tells me that Im not to blame
But when I ask the reason why
She reaches out across the table looks at me and quietly says good-bye
Good-bye
Said so easily
Good-bye
Said so quietly
Good-bye good-bye good-bye
She reaches out across the table looks at me and quietly says good-byeI love Paris in the spring time
I love Paris in the fall
I love Paris in the winter when it drizzles
I love Paris in the summer when it sizzles
I love Paris every moment
Every moment of the year
I love Paris
Why oh why do I love Paris
Because my love is here
I love Paris every moment
Every moment of the year
I love Paris
Why oh why do I love Paris
Because my love is here
Shes there shes everywhere
But shes really hereIf you turn me down once more Ill join the French Foreign Legion
Bet you they would welcome me with open arms
First you love me yes then you love me no
I dont know where I stand
Do we march together down the isle
Or do I march that desert sand
If you think I wont find romance in the French Foreign Legion
Think about that uniform with all its charm
Just one more time are you gonna be mine or au revoir cheri
Its the French Foreign Legion for meI see your face before me crowding my every dream
There is your face before me you are my only theme
It doesnt matter where you are I can see how fair you are
I close my eyes and there you are always
If you could share the magic yes if you could see me too
There would be nothing tragic in all my dreams of you
Would that my love could haunt you so
Knowing I want you so
I cant erase your beautiful face before me
Would that my love could haunt you so
Knowing I want you so
I cant erase your beautiful face before meI wont dance dont ask me
I wont dance dont ask me
I wont dance madame with you
My heart wont let me do things they should do
You know what Youre lovely
You know what youre lovely You know what youre so lovely
And oh what you do to me
Im like an ocean wave thats bumped on the shore
I feel so absolutely stumped on the floor
When you dance youre charming and youre gentle
Specially when you do the Continental
But this feeling isnt purely mental
For heaven rest us Im not asbestos
And thats why I wont dance why should I
I wont dance how could I
I wont dance Merci beaucoup
I know that music leads the way to romance
So if I hold you in my arms I wont dance
I wont dance dont ask me
I wont dance dont ask me
I wont dance madame with you
My heart wont let my feet do things they want to do
You know what Youre lovely ring-a-dingding youre lovely
And oh what you do to me
Im like an ocean wave thats bumped on the shore
I feel so absolutely stumped on the floor
When you dance youre charming and youre gentle
Specially when you do the Continental
But this feeling isnt purely mental
For heaven rest us Im not asbestos
And thats why I wont danceI wont dance
I wont dance Merci beaucoup
I know that music leads the way to romance
So if I hold you in my arms
I wont danceDressed in dreams for me
You were what I wished to see
Elizabeth Elizabeth
Love was very new
Make believe was coming true
Elizabeth Elizabeth
You were all much too much
Out of reach and out of touch
When you came to me
I found it could never be
Elizabeth Elizabeth Elizabeth
So a dream has to end
When its real
Not pretend
Dressed in memories
You are what you used to be
Elizabeth Elizabeth
ElizabethIm a glum one its explainable I met someone unattainable
Lifes a bore the world is my oyster no more
All the papers where I lead the news with my capers now will spread the news
Superman turns out to be flash-in-the-pan
Ive been around the world in a plane designed the latest IBM brain
But lately Im so downhearted cause I cant get started with you
In Cincinnati or in Rangoon I simply smile and all the gals swoon
Their whims Ive more than just charted but I cant get started with you
O tell me why am I no kick to you I whod always stick to you
Fly through thin and thick to you tell me why Im taboo
Each time I chanced to see Franklin D he always said Hi buddy to me
And with queens Ive a la carted but I cant get started with youYou give me your lips and your lips are so heavenly
Stars in the sky are all free and they shine for me
So does the moon in the blue
All this is mine and heaven too
You give me your arms and your arms are like angel wings
Sweet to my ears is the song every bluebird sings
Each rosebud kissed by the dew
All this is mine and heaven too
I own each summer day each mountain capped with snow
The sentimental breeze the dreamy streams that flow
Every country lane and every street of stone
Are highways of adventure made for me alone
You give me your love and your love is a melody
Deep in my heart I will carry this song with me
You bring a love so divine all this is mine
And heaven tooLife is such a great adventure
Learn to live it as you go
No one in the world can censure
What we do here below
Dont save your kisses just pass them around
Youll find my reason is logiclly sound
Whos going to know that you passed them around
A hundred years from today
Why crave a penthouse thats fit for a queen
Youre nearer Heaven on Mother Earths green
If you had millions what would they all mean
A hundred years from today
So laugh and sing make love the thing
Be happy while you may
Theres always one beneath the sun
Whos bound to make you feel that way
The moon is shining and thats a good sign
Cling to me closer and say youll be mine
Remember darling we wont see it shine
A hundred years from today
A hundred years from today
Dont save your kisses just pass them around
Youll find my reason is logiclly sound
Whos going to know that you passed them around
A hundred years from today
Why crave a penthouse thats fit for a queen
Youre nearer heaven on Mother Earths green
If you had millions what would they all mean
A hundred years from today
So laugh and sing make love the thing
Be happy while you may
Theres always one beneath the sun
Whos bound to make you feel that way
The moon is shining and thats a good sign
Cling to me closer and say youll be mine
Remember darling we wont see it shine
A hundred years from todayId know you anywhere Id know that grin
Id know you anywhere when you walked in
I would tingle with a single glance in your eye
Watching the starlight dance in your eye
You saw my vacant stare you understood
Id love you anywhere honest I would
I was certain this would happen strange as it seems
Id know you anywhere from my dreamsIll be seeing you
In all the old familiar places
That this heart of mine embraces
All day through
In that small cafe
The park across the way
The childrens carousel
The chestnut tree
The wishing well
Ill be seeing you
In every lovely summers day
And everything thats bright and gay
Ill always think of you that way
Ill find you in the morning sun
And when the night is new
Ill be looking at the moon
But Ill be seeing youback-up frank with back-up connie haines
Connie haines
i saw your face in a cloud and I was singing out loud
when I saw your face your very lovely face in a cloud
i saw your eyes in a star they winked at me from afar
a million miles away I saw them plain as day in a star
you are on my mind morning noon and night
and no matter where I go I find you are always in my sight
i saw your face in the moon you disappear too soon
so I hope and pray when theres no moon to shine
ill see your lovely face your very lovely face next to mine

Glory to the new-born King
Peace on earth and mercy mild
God and sinners reconciled
Joyful all ye nations rise
Join the triumph of the skies
With th angelic host proclaim
Christ is born in Bethlehem
Hark the herald angels sing
Glory to the new-born King

Born to raise the son of earth
Born to give them second birth
Hark the herald angels sing
Glory to the new-born King Gone with the wind
Just like a leaf that has blown away
Gone with the wind
My romance has flown away
Yesterdays kisses are still on my lips
I had a lifetime of heaven at my fingertips
But now all is gone
Gone is the rapture that thrilled my heart
Gone with the wind
The gladness that filled my heart
Just like a flame love burned brightly
Then became an empty smoke dream that has gone
Gone with the wind
But now all is gone
Gone is the rapture that thrilled my heart
Gone with the wind
The gladness that filled my heart
Just like a flame love burned brightly
Then became an empty smoke dream that has gone
Gone with the wind
Gone with the wind
Gone with the windSky so vast is the sky
with far away clouds just wandering by
Where do they go
oh I dont know dont know
Wind that speaks to the leaves
telling stories that no one believes
Stories of love belong to you and to me
Oh dindi
if I only had words I would say all the beautiful
Things that I see
when youre with me oh my dindi
Oh dindi
like the song of the wind in the trees
thats how my heart is Singing dindi
happy dindi
when you are with me
I love you more each day yes I do yes I do
Id let you go away
if you take me with you
Dont you know dindi
Id be running and searching for you like a river that
Cant find the sea
that would be me without you my dindiI dim all the lights and I sink in my chair
The smoke from my cigarette climbs through the air
The walls of my room fade away in the blue
And Im deep in a dream of you
The smoke makes a stairway for you to descend
You come to my arms may this bliss never end
For we love anew just as we used to do
When Im deep in a dream of you
Then from the ceiling sweet music comes stealing
We glide through a lovers refrain youre so appealing
That Im soon revealing my love for you over again
My cigarette burns me I wake with a start
My hand isnt hurt but theres pain in my heart
Awake or asleep evry memry Ill keep
Deep in a dream of youAll alone Im so all alone
There is no one else but you
All alone by the telephone
Waiting for a ring-a-ting-a-ling
Im all alone every evening
All alone feeling blue
Wondering where you are
And how you are
And if you are all alone too
I wonder where you are remember me
And how you are remember me
And if you are I loved you
All alone I loved you
TooHead on my pillow just thinking of you
Head on my pillow
So lonesome and blue
I wonder where you are tonight
And if you miss me dear
My heart tells me you cant deny
My arms know you left near
Head on my pillow
My thoughts turn to dreams
Head on my pillow
Like heaven it seems
I see a vision build a home of happiness divine
My head on my pillow
With yours close to mineAint she sweet See her walking down that street

Oh aint cha ever coming back to meI dont know why I love you like I do

You never seem to want my romancing
The only time you hold me is when were dancingFarewell farewell to love shes gone and Im through with love
My schemes my dreams of heaven are gone since she went away
Her lips her eyes her touch are the things that Ill miss so much
Her style her smile so thrilling are joys of a sweeter day
Sun is shining so lovely days as bright as can be
Sun keeps shining so lovely but that sun aint shining for me
So farewell farewell to love shes gone theres no sun above
Ive news of blues that got me Ive lost thats the cost of love
Farewell farewell to love shes gone and Im through with love
My schemes my dreams of heaven are gone since she went away
Sun is shining so lovely days as bright as can be
Sun keeps shining so lovely but that sun aint shining for me
So farewell farewell to love shes gone theres no sun above
Ive got news of blues that got me Im oh so sad I feel so bad
Ive lost thats the cost of loveDo I worry cause youre stepping out
Do I worry cause youve got me in doubt
Though your kisses arent right
Do I give a bag of beans
Do I stay home every night
And read my magazines
Am I frantic cause weve lost the spark
Is there panic when it starts turning dark
And when evening shadows creep
Do I lose any sleep over you
Do I worry you can bet your life I doBalmy breezes are blowing - each star in the sky is glowing
But I couldnt care less
Lovely night birds are winging - and filling the night with singing
But I couldnt care less
Oh how perfect the setting - but how do I start forgetting
Im alone where we walked before
For without the warmth of your caress
Its a cold and dreary world - I guess
And I couldnt care less - unless
You could care once more
But I couldnt care less
But I couldnt care less
Oh how perfect the setting - but how do I start forgetting
Im alone where we walked before
For without the warmth of your caress
Its a cold and dreary world - I guessIm gonna sit right down and write myself a letter
And make believe it came from you
Im gonna write words oh so sweet
Theyre gonna knock me off my feet
A lotta kisses at the bottom
Ill be glad I got em
Im gonna smile and say I hope that youre much better
And then Ill close the way I do
Im gonna sit right down and write myself a letter
And make believe that it came from you
Im gonna smile and say I hope that youre much better
The Ill close with love the way you do
Im gonna sit right down and knock out a very large letter
And make believe it came
Although its not the same
Ill make believe it came from youHow are ya fixed for moonlight
How are ya fixed for stars
How are you fixed for kissin
While we listen to soft guitars
How are ya fixed for someone to watch the rain with
To stroll down the lane with
For someone to just go a little insane with
How are you fixed for memries
Memries that shine so bright
If we let fancy take us
We could make us a few tonight
How are ya fixed for someone wholl fit your arms like a glove
Hey tell me baby how are you fixed for love
How are ya fixed for kissin while we dig those wild guitars
How are ya fixed for someone to sit and tan with
To worry and plan with
For someone to dine right from out of a can withFrom this moment on
You for me dear

From this happy day

You and I babe
Well be ridin high babe
Every one of our cares are gone
From this moment
From this very moment
From this moment onIll be lovin you always
With a love thats true always
When the things youve planned need a helpin hand
I will understand always always
Days may not be fair always
Thats when Ill be there always
Not for just an hour not for just a day
Not for just a year but always
Days may not be fair always
Thats when Ill be there always
Not for just an hour not just a day
Not for just one year but always
Always
Always
All the timeBrazil where hearts were entertaining June
We stood beneath an amber moon
And softly murmured Someday soon
We kissed and clung together
Then tomorrow was another day
The morning found me miles away
With still a million things to say
Now when twilight dims the sky above
Recalling thrills of our love
Theres one thing Im certain of
Return I will to old Brazil
Then tomorrow was another day
The morning found me miles away
With still a million things to say
Now when twilight dims the sky above
Recalling thrills of our love
Theres one thing that Im certain of
Return I will to old Brazil
That old Brazil
Man its old in Brazil
Brazil BrazilHear my voice where you are take a train steal a car
Hop a freight grab a star come back to me
Catch a flame catch a breeze on your hand on your knees
Swim up high only please come on back to me
On a mule in a jet with your hair in a net
In a shower wet I dont care
This is where you should be from the hills to the shore
By the wind to my door raise the highway dust
Break the law if you must throw the world only just
Come back to me
Blast your hide you recall must I fight City hall
Here and now damn it all come on back to me
Where on earth must I be still I yell till Im blue
In control then when you come on back to me
Have you gone to the moon or the corner saloon
And to crack and to croon oh my girl where in hell can you be
In a crate in a trunk on a horse on a junk
In a road or a van wrapped in mink or saran
Anyway that you can came back to me
Come back to me come back to me come back
Come back to me meIf you go away
On this summer day
Then you might as well
Take the sun away
All the birds that flew
In the summer sky
When our love was new
And our hearts were high
And the day was young
And the night was long
And the moon stood still
For the night birds song
If you go away
If you go away
If you go away
If you go away
But if you stay
Ill make you a day
Like no day has been
Or will be again
Well sail the sun
Well ride on the rain
Will talk to the trees
And worship the wind
Then if you go
Ill understand
Leave me just enough love
To fill up my hand
If you go away
If you go away
If you go away
If you go away
If you go away
As I know you must
Therell be nothing left
In the world to trust
Just an empty room
Full of empty space
Like the empty look
I see on your face
And Id have been the shadow of your dawn
If I thought it might have kept me by your side
If you go away
If you go away
If you go away
Please dont go awayDay in day out
The same old hoodoo follows me about
The same old pounding in my heart whenever I think of you
And darling I think of you
Day in and day out
Day out day in
I neednt tell you how my days begin
When I awake I awaken with a tingle
One possibility in view
That possibility of maybe seeing you
Come rain come shine
I meet you and to me the day is fine
Then I kiss your lips
And the pounding becomes
The oceans roar
A thousand drums
Cant you see its love
Can there be any doubt
When there it is
Day in day outTheres hidden persuasion within your eyes
Your charming indifference is but a disguise
I would be glad to love you if love is in the deal
But I must feel quite certain that the love is so real
Your hidden persuasion seems quite sincere
Perhaps my evasion is meaningless fear
Since every gain requires the element of chance
Heres hoping at least well find romance
Your hidden persuasion seems quite sincere
Perhaps my evasion is meaningless fear
Since every gain requires that element of chance
Heres hopin at least well find romance
Here is hoping at least well find romanceI guess Ill to dream the rest
If you cant remember the things that you said
The night that my shoulder held your sleepy head
If you believe that partings best
I guess Ill have to dream the rest
I guess Ill have to dream alone
Of honeymoon cruises once dear to my heart
Of one room apartments that we said wed start
Of foolish things we planned to own
I guess Ill have to dream alone
I can see that your heart has gone astray
As for me I love you the same old way
I guess Ill have to dream the rest
Therell be no friends waiting to throw shoes and rice
Those heavenly moments will never come twice
Im thankful for the hours youve blessed
I guess Ill have to dream the restWhen youre near the murmuring of the breeze
Becomes a symphony a rhapsody
And when I hear you call so softly to me
I dont hear a call at all I hear a rhapsody
And when your sparkling eyes are smiling at me
Then soft through the starlit skies I hear a rhapsody
My days are so blue when youre away
My heart longs for you so wont you stay
My darling hold me tight and whisper to me
Then soft through a starry night Ill hear a rhapsody
My days are so blue when youre away
My heart longs for you so wont you stay
My darling hold me tight and whisper to me
Then soft through a starry night Ill hear a rhapsodyIm walking behind you on your wedding day
And Ill hear you promise to love and obey
Though you may forget me youre still on my mind
Look over your shoulder Im walking behind
Maybe Ill kiss again with a love thats new again
But I shall wish again I was kissing you
cause Ill always love you wherever you go
And though we are parted I want you to know
That if things go wrong dear and fate is unkind
Look over your shoulder Im walking behind
So if things go wrong dear and fate is unkind
Look over your shoulder Im walking behindAround the world Ive searched for you
I traveled on when hope was gone to keep a rendezvous
I knew somewhere sometime somehow
Youd look at me and I would see the smile youre smiling now
It might have been in County Down
Or in New York in gay Paree or even London town
No more will I go all around the world
For I have found my world in you
It might have been in County Down
Or in New York in gay Paree or even London town
No more will I go all around the world
For I have found my world in youCan I steal a little love
Can I steal a little love
Coo me honey Im on fire
To steal your love is my desire
Hug me squeeze kiss me til Im red
Til my eyes bug out my head
Coo me woo me turtle dove
Can I steal grab a little love
Please Tell me why are you driving me crazy
And Why do I dig you like I do
If I should steal a little kiss - and you can prove that its it was wrong
HeyHoney Ill give it back to you
Tell me honey with a smile
I can walk will lead you down the isle
I wont even need a shove
Can I steal grab a little loveDays without you when theres so much to tell
What to do Ive got a restless spell
How about you are you alone as well
What to do Ive got a restless spell
Why should this love of mine find me
Restless and moody and blue
Shadows all seem to remind me
Youre meant for me dear and Im meant for you
Love is swell but you cant love alone
Might as well be a statue of stone
Im lost without you dear but what to do
Cause Ive got a restless spellFairy tale my favorite fairy tale is the one I live with wonderful you
Life is so grand a fabulous fairyland and we walk it hand in hand as lovers do
Fantasy became a reality with your tender kiss you open the door
You are marvelous divine Aladdins lamp did shine
The magic days that you were mine
Fairy tale our love is a fairy tale and it never has been told beforeDaybreak another new day
The mist on the meadow is drifting away
For its daybreak the suns in the sky now
And flowers break through their blanket of dew
Sunrise how lovely it seems
To see from my window a sky full of dreams
As the white clouds sail on through the blue
At daybreak I did dream of youYou dont laugh anymore when were alone
You dont talk quite as long when were on the phone
You say that you still love me so but I can read between the lines
You dont hear half the things that I say to you
You dont hold me as close as you used to do
You say that you wont let me go but I can read between the lines
Your love for me is over it isnt hard to tell
In every single thing you do you say it all too well
And the glow in your eyes is there no more
When you speak of the plans that you have in store
Its time my dear that I let you know that I can read between the linesId like to make your golden dreams come true dear
If I only had my way
A paradise this world would seem to you dear
If only I had my way
If I had my way dear forever theres be
A garden of roses for you and for me
A thousand and one things dear I would do
Just for you just for you just for you
If I had my way we would never grow old
And sunshine Id bring every day
You would reign all alone like a queen on a throne
If I had my wayThat old black magic has me in its spell
That old black magic that you weave so well
Icy fingers up and down my spine
The same old witchcraft when your eyes meet mine
The same old tingle that I feel inside
When that elevator starts its ride
Down and down I go round and round I go
Like a leaf thats caught in the tide
I should stay away but what can I do
I hear your name and Im aflame
Aflame with such a burning desire
That only your kiss can put out the fire
You are the lover that Ive waited for
The mate that fate had me created for
And every time your lips meet mine
Baby down and down I go all around I go
In a spin loving the spin that Im in
Under that old black magic called loveA day in the life of a fool
A sad and a long lonely day
I walk the avenue and hope Ill run into
The welcome sight of you coming my way
I stop just across from your door
But youre never home any more
So back to my room and there in the gloom
I cry tears of goodbye
Thats the way it will be every day in the life of foolVolare
Volare oh oh oh oh
E cantare oh oh oh oh
No wonder my happy heart sings
Your love has given me wings
Penso che un sogno cosi non ritorni mai piu
Mi dipingevo le mani e la faccia di blu
Poi dimprovviso venivo dal vento rapito
E incominciavo a volare nel cielo infinito
On an evening in Roma
Down each avenue or via street or strata
You can seeem disappearing two by two
On an evening in Roma
Do they takeem for espresso
Yeah I guess so
On each lovers arm a girl I wish I knew
On an evening in Roma
Though theres grining and mandolining in sunny Italy
The beginning has just begun when the sun goes down
So please meet me in the plaza near your casa
I am only one and one is much too fewGot my tweed pressed got my best vest all I need now is the girl
Got my striped tie got my hopes high
Got the time and the place and I got the rhythm
Now all I needs the girl to go with em
If shell just appear well take this big town for a whirl
And if shell say My darling Im yours
Ill throw away my striped tie and my best-pressed tweed
All I really need is the girl
Got my tweed pressed I got my best vest all I need now is the girl

That heaven find a way so I might just run into you
Just to be near you and to hear you say hello
Would give an ordinary day a lovely glow
Ill never let a day pass by but that Ill see your face
And thrill to every tender sigh while youre in my embrace
I know its all a dream but darling if it were true
Ill never let a day pass by without my loving youHere goes - baby here goes
Every worry every fear goes
Every dull day in the year goes
Im about to fall in love
Here goes - yes sir here goes
Every sky that isnt clear goes
Every sigh thats insincere goes
Cause its you Im dreamin of
Looks like Ive been sold out
Cant fight off the charms
I just couldnt hold out
Its cold out of your arms
Here goes - get the rice out
Get the trip to - paradise out
Sweep that stairway - through the airway up above
Here goes - baby here goes
Someone ready for love
Here goes - brush that grin off
Brush that endless - bobby pin off
And the biscuits - that chagrin off
Im about to fall in love
Here goes - get the fights out
And the quarrel - over nights out
And the patch up - when the lights out
That is all Im dreaming of
Looks like Ive been taken
Shaken off the tree
Looks like youll be makin
The bacon just for me
Here goes - get the rice out
Get the trip to - paradise out
Sweep that stairway - through the airway up above
Here goes - here goes
Here goes someone - someone whos really in loveI left my heart in San Francisco
High on a hill it calls to me
to be where little cable cars
climb halfway to the stars
The morning fog may chill the air
I dont care
My love waits there in San Francisco
above the blue and windy sea
When I come home to you San Francisco
your golden sun will shine for me
I left my heart in San Francisco
High on a hill it calls to me
to be where little cable cars
climb halfway to the stars
The morning fog may chill the air
I dont care
My love waits there in San Francisco
above the blue and windy sea
When I come home to you San FranciscoLike the folks you meet on
Like to plant my feet on the Brooklyn Bridge
What a lovely view from
Heaven looks at you from the Brooklyn Bridge
I love to listen to the wind through her strings
The song that she sings for the town
I love to look up at the clouds in her hair
Shes learned to wear like a crown
If youve been a rover
Journeys end lies over the Brooklyn Bridge
Dont let no one tell you
Ive been tryin to sell you the Brooklyn Bridge
All the folks in Manhattan are sad
Cause they look at her and wish they had
The good old Brooklyn Bridge
If youve been a rover
Journeys end lies over the Brooklyn Bridge
Dont let no one tell you
Ive been tryin to sell you the Brooklyn Bridge
Youll miss her most when you roam
Cause youll think of her and think of home
The good old Brooklyn BridgeThrough the clouds gray with years over hill wet with tears
To a world young and free we shall fly follow me
April green everywhere April songs always there
Come and hear come and see follow me
To the tree where our hopes hang high
To the dream that should never die
Where our long lost tomorrows still are in the sweet bye and bye
Time goes by or do we close your eyes and youll see
As we were we can be weep no more follow me
Follow me follow me
To the tree where our hopes hang high
To the dream that should never die
Where our long lost tomorrows still are in the sweet bye and bye
Time goes by or do we close your eyes and youll see
As we were we can be weep no more follow me
Follow me follow me follow me follow me
Get behind me follow meI got plenty of nothing
And nothing is plenty for me
I got no car
Got no mule
Got no misery
Folks with plenty of plenty
They got a lock on the door
Afraid somebodys gonna rob them while
theyre out making more
What for
I got no lock on the door
thats no way to be
They can steal the rug
From the floor
thats OK with me
Cause the things that I prize
Like the stars in the sky
Are all free
Say Ive got plenty of nothing
And nothing is plenty for me
I got my girl
Got my song
Got heaven the whole daylong
Got my girl
Got my lawn
Got my song
Ive got plenty of nothing
And nothing is plenty for me
I got my girl
Got my song
Got heaven the whole daylong
Got my girl
Got my lawn
Got my songSo Im down and so Im out
But so are many others
So I feel like tryin to hide
My head neath these covers
Life is like the seasons
After winter comes the spring
So Ill keep this smile awhile
And see what tomorrow brings
Ive been told and I believe
That life is meant for livin
And even when my chips are low
Theres still some left for givin
Ive been many places
Maybe not as far as you
So I think Ill stay awhile
And see if some dreams come true
There isnt much that I have learned
Through all my foolish years
Except that life keeps runnin in cycles
First theres laughter then those tears
But Ill keep my head up high
Although Im kinda tired
My gal just up and left last week
Friday I got fired
You know its almost funny
But things cant get worse than now
So Ill keep on tryin to sing
But please just dont ask me howHeaven Im in heaven
And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak
And I seem to find the happiness I seek
When were out together dancing cheek to cheek
Heaven Im in heaven
And the cares that hung around me through the week
Seem to vanish like a gamblers lucky streak
When were out together dancing swinging cheek to cheek
Oh I love to climb a mountain
And reach the highest peak
But it doesnt thrill boot me half as much
As dancing cheek to cheek
Oh I love to go out fishing
In a river or a creek
But I dont enjoy it half as much
As dancing cheek to cheek
Come on and dance with me
I want my arms about you
That those charms about you
Will carry me through
Right up to heaven Im in heaven
And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak
And I seem to find the happiness I seek
When were out together dancing out together dancing swinging
Out together dancing cheek to cheekBlow ill wind
Blow away
Let me rest today
Youre blowin me no good
No good
Go ill wind
Go away
Skies are oh so gray
Around my neighborhood
And that aint good
Youre only misleadin the sunshine Im needin
Aint that a shame
Its so hard to keep up with troubles that creep up
From out of nowhere
When loves to blame
So ill wind blow away
Let me rest today
Youre blowin me no good
So ill wind blow away
Please let me rest today
Youre blowing me no good no good no goodEmily Emily Emily
Has the murmuring sound of may
All silver bells coral shells carousels
And the laughter of children at play
Say Emily Emily Emily
And we fade to a marvelous view
Two lovers alone and out of sight
Seeing images in the firelight
As my eyes visualize a family
They see Emily Emily
and we fade to a marvelous view
Two lovers alone and out of sight
Seeing images in the firelight
As my eyes visualize a family
They see Emily Emily

Dont cry Joe let her go let her go let her goFools rush in where angels fear to tread
And so I come to you my love my heart above my head
Though I see the danger there
If theres a chance for me then I dont care
Fools rush in where wise men never go
But wise men never fall in love
So how are they to know
When we met I felt my life begin
So open up your heart and let this fool rush inClose to you - I will always stay
Close to you - though youre far away
Youll always be near - as though you were here
By my side
No matter where - in my dreams Ill find you there
Close to me - sharing your caress
Cant you see - youre my happiness
Where ever you go - my heart will go too
What can I do
It only wants to be - close to youSummer you old Indian Summer
Youre the tear that comes after June times laughter
You see so many dreams that dont come true
Dreams we fashioned when Summertime was new
You are here to watch over
Some heart that is broken
By a word that somebody left unspoken
Youre the ghost of a romance in June going astray
Fading too soon thats why I say
Farewell to you Indian SummerIm a fool to want you
Im a fool to want you
To want a love that cant be true
A love thats there for others too
Im a fool to hold you
Such a fool to hold you
To seek a kiss not mine alone
To share a kiss that devil has known
Time and time again I said Id leave you
Time and time again I went away
But then would come the time when I would need you
And once again these words Id have to say
Take me back I love you
It hit me I need you
I know its wrong it must be wrong
But right or wrong I cant get alongLet me tell bout a gal i know
Shes my baby and she lives next door
Every morning fore the sun comes up
She brings my coffee in my favorite cup
Thats why i know yes i know
Hallelujah i just love her so
When im in trouble and i got no friend
I know shell go with me down to the end
Everybody asks me how do i know
I smile a damn and say she told me so
That why i know yes i know
Hallelujah i just love her so
Now if i call her on the telephone
Tell her that im all alone
By the time i count from one to four
I hear her on my door
In the evening when the sun goes down
When there aint nobody hanging round
She just kisses me and then holds me tight
And tells me baby everythings gonna be alright
Thats why i know yes i know
Hallelujah i just love her so
Thats why i know yes i know
Hallelujah i just i love her so
Thats why i know yes i know
Hallelujah i just love her soAh take a look and youll see
The way I have become and the way things became
Sadness and sorrow are here
In the little things you touched with your hands
This loving home was a home so happy
To protect you and keep you with care
The flowers in the window were smiling
Were glowing just knowing you were there
Listen my love nevermore
Dont ever go away
Cause we are you are your life and your dream
And we want you to stay
Come in my love
Come to me dont let this heartless world
Bring another good bye
Embrace me in a simple way
Dont speak dont remember and darling dont cryIll be around no matter how you treat me now
Ill be around from now on
Your latest love can never last
And when its past Ill be around when hes gone
Goodbye again and if you find a love like mine
Just now and then drop a line
To say youre feeling fine
And when things go wrong
Perhaps youll see youre meant for me
So Ill be around when hes gone
Goodbye again
Now and then
Drop a line
To say that youre feeling fine
And when things go wrong
Perhaps youll see youre meant for me
So Ill be around when hes goneI like the sunrise cause it brings a new day
I like a new day it brings new hope they say
I like the sunrise blazing in the new start
Night time is weary oh and so am I
Every evening I wish upon a star
That my brand new bright tomorrow isnt very far
When that heavy blue curtain of night is raised up high
Out of sight I like the sunrise oh heavenly day
I like the sunrise I hope it lights for me
Every evening I wish upon a star
That my brand new bright tomorrow isnt very far
When that heavy blue curtain of night is raised up high
Way out of sight I like the sunrise so heavenly to see
I like the sunrise I hope it lights for me
I hope it lights for meThe best of everything thats that is what I wish you all
The best of everything a Rembrandt hanging on your the wall
A yacht that wins you cups skateboards with style and speed
Show dogs or loving pups the pride of the pound or the pedigreed
I hope you win that prize pass that blue ribbon test
I hope your good keeps getting better til your betters best
With every wine you taste with every song you sing
By now you may have guest I hope you get the best of everythingDont forget tonight tomorrow though we may be far apart
If you forget tonight tomorrow
Youll leave me with a broken heart
Are your kisses only mine tomorrow
Say you love me and you will be true
And dont forget tonight tomorrow
Dont forget that Im love with youIll see you in my dreams hold you in my dreams
Someone took you out of my heart and I feel the touch of your hand
Lips that once were mine tender eyes that shine
They will light my way tonight Ill see you in my dreamsHow insensitive
I must have seemed
When she told me that he loved me
How unmoved and cold
I must have seemed
When she told me so sincerely
Why she must have asked
Did I just turn and stare in icy silence
What was I to say
What can you say when a love affair is over
Now shes gone away
And Im alone with the memory of her last look
Vague and drawn and sad
I see it still
All her heartbreak in that last look
Why she must have asked
Did I just stare in icy silence
What was I to do
What can one do when a love affair is overIt seems to me Ive heard that song before
Its from an old familiar score
I know it well that melody
Its funny how a theme
Recalls a favorite dream
A dream that brought you so close to me
I know each word because Ive heard that song before
The lyrics said for evermore
For evermores a memory
Please have them play it again
And Then Ill remember just when
I heard that lovely song beforeDancin in the dark til the tune ends
Were dancin in the dark and it soon ends
Were waltzin in the wonder of why were here
Time hurries by were here and were gone
Lookin for the light of a new love
To brighten up the night I have you love
And we can face the music together
Dancing in the dark
What though love is old
What though song is old
Through them we can be young
Hear this heart of mine
Wailin all the time
Dear one tell me that were one
Lookin for the light of a new love
To brighten up the night I have you love
And we can face the music together
Dancin in the dark
Dancin in the dark
Dancin in the darkStars in the sky were dancing
One night perfect for romancing
The night a sinner kissed an angel
He wanted thrills she wanted love
Oh but his sighs were tender
As he begged her to surrender
The night a sinner kissed an angel
And she believed that it was love
How was she to know that every lovely vow
Was part of the game he was playing
But to his surprise he realized
Somehow he meant every word he was saying
Yes miracles can happen
I know cause I saw what happened
That night a sinner kissed an angel
That was the night I fell in loveTherell be a hot time in the town of Berlin
When the Yanks go marching in
I wanna be there boy and spread some joy
When they take old Berlin
Therell be a hot time in the town of Berlin
When the Brooklyn boys begin
To take the joint apart and tear it down
When they take old Berlin
Theyre gonna start a row and show them how
We paint the town back in Kokomo
Theyre gonna take a hike through Hitlers Reich
And change the Heil to Whatcha-know-Joe
Therell be a hot time in the town of Berlin
When the Yanks go marching in
You could never keep em happy down on the farm
After they take Berlin
Therell be a hot time in the town of Berlin
When the Yanks go marching in
Oh what a Jubilee theres gonna be
When they take old Berlin
Therell be a hot time in the town of Berlin
When the Brooklyn boys begin
To take the joint apart and tear it down
When they take old Berlin
Theyre gonna start a row and show them how
We paint the town back in Michigan
Theyre gonna take a hike through Hitlers Reich
And change the Heil to Gimme some skin
Therell be a hot time in the town of Berlin
When the Yanks go marching in
You could never keep em happy down on the farm
After they take BerlinI took a trip on a train
And I thought about you
I passed a shadowy lane
And I thought about you
Two or three cars parked under the stars
Winding stream
Moon shining down on some little town
And with each beam the same old dream
And every stop that we made
Oh I thought about you
And when I pulled down the shade
Then I really felt blue
I peeped through the crack
Looked at the track
Oh Im going back to you
And what did I do I thought about you
There were two or three cars parked under the stars
Winding stream
Moon shining down on some little town
And with each beam the same old dream
And then I peeped through the crack
And I looked at the track
Oh Im going back to you
And what did I do I thought about youBy a country road wild roses grow
That need my special care
So I havent time to be a millionaire
And a cheerful brook on a mountain side
Is sad when Im not there
So I havent time to be a millionaire
And a friendly gang of robins
Are peeved when I forget
That Im the second tenor in their quartet
So with all the things I have to do
Im very much aware
If I wished for wealth it wouldnt be quite fair
Cause I havent time to be a millionaireI weave with brightly colored strings
To keep my mind off other things
So ladies let your fingers dance
And keep your hands out of romance
Lovely witches
Let the stitches
Keep your fingers under control
Cut the thread but leave
The whole heart whole
Merry maids can sew and sleep
Wives can only sew and weep
Falling in love with love
Is falling for make-believe
Falling in love with love
Is playing the fool
Caring too much is juvenile fancy
Learning to trust is just
For children in school
I fell in love with love one night
When the mood was full
I was unwise with eyes
Unable to seeNext time your found with your chin on the ground
There a lot to be learned so look around
Just what makes that little old ant
Think hell move that rubber tree plant
Anyone knows an ant cant
Move a rubber tree plant
But hes got high hopes hes got high hopes
Hes got high apple pie in the sky hopes
So any time your gettin low
Stead of lettin go
Just remember that ant
Oops there goes another rubber tree plant
When troubles call and your backs to the wall
There a lot to be learned that wall could fall
Once there was a silly old ram
Thought hed punch a hole in a dam
No one could make that ram scram
He kept buttin that dam
Cause he had high hopes he had high hopes
He had high apple pie in the sky hopes
So any time your feelin bad
stead of feelin sad
Just remember that ram
Oops there goes a billion kilowatt dam
All problems just a toy balloon
Theyll be bursted soon
Theyre just bound to go pop
Oops there goes another problem kerplopWhen youre alone and life is making you lonely
You can always go - downtown
When youve got worries all the noise and the hurry
Seems to help I know - downtown
Just listen to the music of the traffic in the city
Linger on the sidewalk where the neon signs are pretty
How can you lose
The lights are much brighter there
You can forget all your troubles forget all your cares
So go downtown thingsll be great when youre
Downtown - no finer place for sure
Downtown - everythings waiting for you
Dont hang around and let your problems surround you
There are movie shows - downtown
Maybe you know some little places to go to
Where they never close - downtown
Just listen to the rhythm of a gentle bossa nova
Youll be dancing with him too before the night is over
Happy again
The lights are much brighter there
You can forget all your troubles forget all your cares
So go downtown where all the lights are bright
Downtown - waiting for you tonight
Downtown - youre gonna be all right now
And you may find somebody kind to help and understand you
Someone who is just like you and needs a gentle hand to
Guide them along
So maybe Ill see you there
We can forget all our troubles forget all our cares
So go downtown thingsll be great when youre
Downtown - dont wait a minute for
Downtown - everythings waiting for you
Downtown downtown downtown downtown Are the stars out tonight
I dont know if its cloudy or bright
Cause I only have eyes for you dear
The moon may be high
But I cant see a thing in the sky
Cause I only have eyes for you
I dont know if were in a garden
Or on a crowded avenue
You are here so am I
Maybe millions of people go by
But they all disappear from view
And I only have eyes for you
I dont know if were in a garden
Or on a crowded avenue
You are here so am I
Maybe millions of people go by
But they all disappear from view
And I only have eyes for youI guess Ill have to change my plan
I should have realized thered be another man
I overlooked that point completely
Until the big affair began
Before I knew where I was at
I found myself upon the shelf and that was that
I tried to reach the moon but when I got there
All that I could get was the air
My feet are back upon the ground
Ive lost the one girl Id found
Before I knew where I was at
I found myself upon the shelf and that was that
I tried to reach the moon but when I got there
All that I could get was the airINSTRUMENTALIn this world of ordinary people
Extraordinary people
Im glad there is you
In this world of over-rated pleasures
Of under-rated treasures
Im so glad there is you
I live to love
I love to live with you beside me
This role so new
Ill muddle through with you to guide me
In this world where many many play at love
And hardly any stay in love
Im glad there is you
In this world where many many play at love
And hardly any stay in love
Im glad there is you
More than ever
Im glad there is youI couldnt sleep a wink last night
Because we had that silly fight
I thought my heart would break the whole night through
I knew that youd be sorry and Im sorry too
I didnt have my favorite dream
The one in which I hold you tight
I had to call you up this morning
To see if everything was still all right
Yes I had to call you up this morning
Cause I couldnt sleep a wink last night
I didnt have my favorite dream
The one in which I hold you tight
I had to call you up this morning
To see if everything was still all right
Yes I had to call you up this morning
Cause I couldnt sleep a wink last nightI gotta right to sing the blues
I gotta right to feel low-down
I gotta right to hang around
Down around the river
A certain gal in this old town
Keeps draggin my poor old heart around
All I see for me is - misery
I gotta right to sing the blues
I gotta right to moan and sigh
I gotta right to sit and cry
Down around the river
I know the deep blue sea
Will soon be callin meYour love is rain
My heart the flower
I need your love or i will die
My very life is your power
Will i wither and fade or bloom to the sky
Aqua de beber
Give the flower water to drink
Aqua de beber
Give the flower water to drink
The rain can fall
On distant deserts
The rain can fall upon the sea
The rain can fall upon the flower
Since the rain has to fall let it fall on me
Aqua de beber
Give the flower water to drink
Aqua de beber
Give the flower water to drinkI took each word she said as gospel truth
The way a silly little child would
I cant excuse it on the grounds of youth
I was no babe in the wild wild wood
She didnt mean it
I should have seen it
But now its too late
I thought Id found the girl of my dreams
Now it seems
This is how the story ends
Shes gonna turn me down and say
Cant we be friends
I thought for once it couldnt go wrong
Not for long
I can see the way this ends
Shes gonna turn me down and say
Cant we be friends
Why should I care though she gave me the air
Why should I cry
Heave a sigh
And wonder why
And wonder why
I thought I found the gal I could trust
What a bust this is how the story ends
Shes gonna turn me down and say
Cant we be just friendsForget your troubles and just get happy
You better chase all your cares away
Sing Hallelujah come on get happy
Get ready for the Judgment Day
The sun is shining come on get happy
The Lord is waiting to take your hand
Shout Hallelujah come on get happy
Were going to the promised land
Were heading cross the river
Wash your sins way in the tide
Its all so peaceful on the other side
Forget your troubles and just get happy
You better chase all your cares away
Shout Hallelujah come on get happy
Get ready for the Judgment Day
Forget your troubles and just get happy
You better chase all your cares away
Sing Hallelujah come on get happy
Get ready for the Judgment Day
That sun is shining come on get happy
The Lord is waiting to take you by the hand
Shout Hallelujah come on get happy
Were going to the promised land
Were heading cross the river
Wash your sins way in the tide
And its all so nice and peaceful
When you get on the other side
Forget your troubles and just get happy
You better chase all your cares away
Shout Hallelujah come on get happy
Get ready for the Judgment Day
Forget your troubles come on get happy
Forget your troubles come on be happy
Forget your troubles come on stay happy
Happy stay happyI never cared much for moonlight skies I never wink at fireflies
But now that the stars are in your eyes Im beginning to see the light
I never went for after-glow candle light on the mistletoe
But now when you turn the lamp down low Im beginning to see the light
Used to ramble through the park shadow boxing in the dark
Then you came and caused a spark thats a four-alarm fire now
I never made love by lantern shine I never saw rainbows on my wine
But now that your lips are burning mine Im beginning to see the lightOh give me land lots of land and the starry skies above dont fence me in
Let me ride through the wide open country that I love dont fence me in
Oh let me be by myself in the evening breeze
And listen to the murmur of the cottonwood trees
Send me off forever but I ask you please dont fence me in
Just turn me loose and Ill straddle on my saddle underneath the western skies
On my cayuse let me wander over yonder till I see the mountains rise
Oh let me ride to the ridge where the west commences
Gaze at the moon till I lose my senses
Cant look at hobbles and I cant stand fences dont fence me inI believe I believe
I believe in wishing wells
And I also believe in a lot of things
Things the daisy tells
I believe I believe that a four-leaf clover brings
Lots of luck lots of joy lots of happiness
I believe those things
And when its Christmas time I believe in Santa Claus
Why do I believe I guess that I believe because
I believe I do believe
I believe that dreams come true
If you wish for a dream by a wishing well
Dont tell the wish or youll break the spell
It may sound naive but thats what I believe
And when its Christmas time I believe in Santa Claus
Why do I believe I guess that I believe because
I believe I believe
I believe that dreams come true
If you wish for a dream by a wishing well
Dont you tell the wish or youll break the spell
It may sound naive but thats what
Thats what I believeIll only miss her when I think of her
And Ill think of her all the time
Likely Ill spend my days hearing her turn of a phrase
Things I found hard to praise right now would seem sublime
The truth is
Ill only miss her when some stranger laughs
cause its still her laugh my heart hears
Maybe in time I guess the longing will grow the slightest bit less
And there will be moments yes when it disappears
Ill bet I forget her completely
In about a hun- dred years
Mm mm mm mmNight and you and blue Hawaii
The night is heavenly and you are heaven to me
Lovely you and blue Hawaii
With all this loveliness there should be love
Come with me while the moon is on the sea
The night is young and so are we
Dreams come true in blue Hawaii
And mine could all come true
This magic night of nights with youHere goes
Looks like Im falling
Call me devil-may care
I know it shouldnt be
But you know me pal Ill take a dare
Who knows but this time I may be lucky
This may be on the square
Here goes its an adventure
Just call me devil-may-careCouldve danced all night couldve danced all night
And still have begged for more
I couldve spread my wings and done a thousand things
Ive never done before
Ill never know what made it so exciting
Why all at once my heart took flight
I only know when she began to dance with me
I couldve danced danced danced danced danced all night
I couldve danced all night I couldve have danced all night
And still have danced some more
I couldve spread my wings and done a thousand things
That Ive never done before
Ill never know what made it so so exciting
Why all at once my heart took flight
I only know when she began to dance with me
I could have danced danced danced danced danced all nightIf I loved you
Time and again I would try to say
All Id want you to know
If I loved you
Words wouldnt come in an easy way
Round in circles Id go
Longin to tell you
But afraid and shy
Id let my golden chances pass me by
Soon youd leave me
Off you would go in the mist of day
Never never to know how I loved you
If I loved youLets forget about tomorrow
Lets forget about tomorrow
Lets forget about tomorrow for tomorrow never comes
Domani forget domani
Lets live for now and anyhow who needs domani
The moonlight lets share the moonlight
Perhaps together we will never be again
Ah che luna oh che mare
With such a moon and such a sea and you and me
I get so dizzy when youre standing near
Its not the music that you hear
My heart is beating like a jungle drum
Lets take the minutes as they speed away
And hope its true what people say
When youre in love tomorrow never comes
Lets forget about tomorrow
Lets forget about tomorrow
Lets forget about tomorrow for tomorrow never comes
Lets forget about tomorrow
Lets forget about tomorrow
Lets forget about tomorrow for tomorrow never comes
Domanidomani domani
With such a moon and such a sea and you and me
Lets take the minutes as they speed away
And hope its true what people say
When youre in love tomorrow never comes
Lets forget about tomorrow

Lets forget about tomorrow for tomorrow never comes
Oh lets forget about tomorrow

It may be you will never come if you never come to me
Whats the use of my wonderful dreams and why would they need me
Where would they lead me without you To nowhere
Whats the use of my wonderful dreams and why would they need me
Where would they lead me without you To nowhereSue wants a barbecue Sam wants to boil a ham
Grace votes for bouillabaisse too
Jake wants a weenie bake steak and the layer cake
And hell get a tummy ache too
Well rent a tent or a tee pee let the town crier cry
And if its on a ditty this is what Ill reply
In the cool cool cool of the evening tell em Ill be there
In the cool cool cool of the evening better save a chair
Oh when the partys a-getting a glow on and singing fills the air
In the shank of the night when the doings all right
You can tell em Ill be there

Im not too good at leaving time
Ive got no taste for grieving time
No no not me
Youve been my near ones always my dear ones
I never thought that I would find
Another love a different kind
But it came to be
Well if you think Im telling you lies
Go try your luck and look into her eyes
But remember you must remember shes mine
And my world overhead has a clear new shine
Dont want to leave you
Sorry to grieve you
Its traveling time and I must move on
Found the girl gal to lean uponI came down from Butte Montana for a little change of scene
And I stopped to stay in Santa Fe where I met a pretty queen
Hair of gold eyes of blue lips like cherry wine
Shes the prettiest gal I ever know and Im gonna make her mine
Now I planned to leave on Monday but she held me kinda tight
So I stood my ground and hung around and then I left on Friday night
Oh hair of gold eyes of blue lips like cherry wine
The prettiest gal I ever knew and Im gonna make her mineAfter youve gone and left me crying
After youve gone theres no denying
Youll feel blue youre gonna be sad
Youve missed the dearest pal that slickest partner you ever had
Therell come a time dont you forget it
Yeah therell come a time when youre gonna regret it
Some day when you get lonely
Your heart will break like mine and youll want me only
After youve gone split after youve gone away flown the coop
After we paid our dues together
You should have stayed through all that nasty weather
Someday while youre feeling badly
Youll need the only one that loves you so madly
But Ill be gone yes Ill be gone to stay
Yeah after Ive gone after Ive gone awayYou must remember this
A kiss is still a kiss
A sigh is just a sigh
The fundamental things apply
As time goes by
And when two lovers woo
They still say I love you
On that you can rely
No matter what the future brings
As time goes by
Moonlight and love songs never out of date
Hearts full of passion jealousy and hate
Woman needs man and man must have his mate
That no one can deny
Its still the same old story
A fight for love and glory
A case of do or die
The world will always welcome lovers
As time goes byI wish that we could live up in the sky
Where we could find a place away up high
Live among the stars the sun the moon
Just you and I
East of the sun and west of the moon
Well build a dream house of love dear
Near to the sun in the day
Near to the moon at night
Well live in a lovely way dear
Living our love and pale moonlight
Just you and I forever and a day
Love will not die well keep it that way
Up among the stars well find
A harmony of life to a lovely tune
East of the sun and west of the moon dear
East of the sun and west of the moonWell I think Im goin out of my head
Yes I think Im goin out of my head over you over you
I want you want you to want me I need you so badly
I cant think of anything but you
Goin out of my head over you
Out of my head over you
Out of my head day and night
Night and day and night
Wrong or right
I must think of a way into your heart
Theres no reason why my being so shy should keep us apart
And I think Im goin out of my head
Cause I cant explain the tears that I shed over you over you
I see you each morning but you just walk by me
You dont even know that I exist
Goin out of my head over you
Out of my head over you
Out of my head day and night
Night and day and night
Wrong or right day and nightChicago Chicago that toddlin town
Chicago Chicago I will show you around
I love it
Bet your bottom dollar youll lose the blues
In Chicago Chicago
The town that Billy Sunday couldnt shut down
On State Street that great street I just want to say

They have a time the time of their life
I saw a man he danced with his wife
In Chicago Chicago my hometown
Chicago Chicago that toddlin town
Chicago Chicago Ill show you around

Bet your bottom dollar youll lose the blues
In Chicago Chicago

Chicago thats my hometownThis lovely day will lengthen into evening
Well sigh goodbye to all we ever had
Alone where we have walked together
Ill remember April and be glad
Ill be content you loved me once in April
Your lips were warm and love and spring were new
Im not afraid of autumn and her sorrow
For Ill remember April and you
The fire will dwindle into glowing ashes
For flames live such a little while
I wont forget but I wont be lonely
Ill remember April and smileIm in the mood for love
Simply because youre near me
Funny but when youre near me
Im in the mood for love
Heaven is in your eyes
Bright as the stars were under
Oh Is it any wonder
Im in the mood for love
Why stop to think of whether
This little dream might fade
Weve put our hearts together
Now we are one Im not afraid
If theres a cloud above
If it should rain well let it
But for tonight forget it
Im in the mood for loveI dont want you but I hate to lose you
You got me in between the devil and the deep blue sea
I forgive you cause I cant forget you
Youve got me in between the devil and the deep blue sea
I want to cross you off my list
When you come a-knocking at my door
Fate seems to give my heart a twist
And I come running back for more
I should hate you but I guess I love you
Youve got me in between the devil and the deep blue sea
I want to cross you off my list
But every time you come back knocking at my door
Fate seems to give my heart a twist
And I come crawling back for more
I still should hate you but I guess I gotta love you
You got me sort of hung up between
The devil and the deep blue sea
Devil and the deep blue sea
Devil and the deep blue sea yeah
Devil and the deep blue seaI fall in love too easily I fall in love too fast
I fall in love too terribly hard for love to ever last
My heart should be well schooled cause Ive been fooled in the past
And still I fall in love too easily I fall in love too fast
I fall in love too easily I fall in love too fast
I fall in love too terribly hard for love to ever last
My heart should be well schooled cause Ive been fooled in the past
And still I fall in love too easily I fall in love too fastMy mama done tol me when I was in knee-pants
My mama done tol me Son a womanll sweet talk
And give you the big eye but when the sweet talkins done
A womans a two-face a worrisome thing wholl leave you to sing
The blues in the night
Now the rains a-fallin hear the trains a-callin whooee
My mama done tol me hear that lonesome whistle
Blowin cross the trestle whooee
My mama done tol me a-whooee-ah-whooee
Ol clickety-clacks a-echoin back
The blues in the night
The evenin breeze will start the trees to cryin
And the moon will hide its light
When you get the blues in the night
And take my word the mockingbirdll sing the saddest kind o song
He knows things are wrong and hes so right
From Natchez to Mobile from Memphis to St Joe
Wherever the four winds they might blow
I been in some big towns an heard me some big talk
But there is one thing I know
A womans a two-face a worrisome thing wholl leave ya to sing the blues in the night
Mmm ooh ooh ooh my mama was right theres blues in the nightGet in touch with that sundown fellow
As he tiptoes across the sand
Hes got a million kinds of stardust
Pick you favright brand and
Dream when youre feeling blue
Dream thats the thing to do
Just watch the smoke rings rise in the air
Youll find your share of memories there
So dream when the day is through
Dream and they might come true
Things never are as bad as they seem
So dream dream dreamMy story is much too sad to be told
But practically everything leaves me totally cold
The only exception I know is the case
When Im out on a quiet spree
Fighting vainly the old ennui
And I suddenly turn and see your fabulous face
I get no kick from champagne
Mere alcohol doesnt thrill me at all
So tell me why should it be true
That I get a kick out of you
Some they may go for a cocaine
Im sure that if I took even one sniff
It would bore me terrifically too
Yet I get a kick out of you
I get a kick every time I see you
Standing there before me
I get a kick though its clear to see
You obviously do not adore meTime and again Ive longed for adventure
Something to make my heart beat much faster
What did I long for I never really knew
Finding your love I found my adventure
Touching your hand my heart beat much faster
All that I want in all of this world is you
You are the promised kiss of springtime
That makes the lonely winter seem long
You are the breathless hush of evening
That trembles on the brink of a lovely song
You are the angel glow that lights the star
The dearest things I know are what you are
Someday my happy arms will hold you
And someday Ill know that moment divine
When all the things you are are mineYou have the cool clear eyes of a seeker of wisdom and truth
Yet theres that upturned chin and the grin of impetuous youth
I believe in you I believe in you
I hear the sound of good solid judgment whenever you talk
Yet theres that bold brave spring of the tiger that quickens your walk
I believe in you I believe in you
And when my faith in my fellow man all but falls apart
Ive but to feel your hand grasping mine and I take heart
I take heart to see the cool clear eyes of a seeker of wisdom and truth
Yet theres that slam bang tang reminiscent of gin and Vermouth
Now I believe in you I believe in you
Musical interludeWriters glennroberts
Baby you went and broke your faithful promise
How could you do a thing like that to me
Didnt I give you everything I promised
How could you do a thing like that to me
Never thought youd be untrue when my back was turned on you
If someone gave me all the world to hurt you I wouldnt do a thing like that to you
Never thought youd be untrue when my back was turned on you
If someone gave me the whole wide world to hurt you I wouldnt do a thing like that to you
No maam I wouldnt do a thing like that to you
So how could you do a thing like that to meSo youre leaving
In the morning
On the early train
I could say everythings alright
I could pretend and say good bye
Got your ticket
Got your suitcase
Got your leaving smile
I could say thats the way it goes
I could pretend and you wont know
That I was lying
Cause I cant stop loving you
I cant stop loving you
No I cant stop loving you
Though I try
Took a taxi
To the station
Not a word was said
I saw you walk across the road
Maybe the last time I dont know
Feeling humble
I heard a rumble
On the railway track
And when I hear the whistle blow
I walk away and you dont know
That I was lying
Cause I cant stop loving you
No I cant stop loving you
I cant stop loving you
Though I try
Cause I cant stop loving you
I cant stop loving you
No I cant stop loving you
Though I tryOne afternoon I came to hear
You sing a soft song into my ear
Who would have thought quite by chance
We might engage in a loving dance
Coming together coming apart
Lost in diversions dancing stars
Caught in the quiet off on our own
Coming together standing alone
Are you afraid Im not afraid
What about you what about me
Two years from now where will we be
Each of us gone our separate ways
Lost in a headlong passage of days
Maybe we might give love a try
Extending the moment before goodbye
And for a gentle moment in time
Well take what pleasure people can find
Are you afraid Im not afraid
What is for real what is false
All of us seem to be caught in a waltz
Turning around turning again
When will the dancing ever end
As for us you and me
Our eyes are open we can see
Both of us know where weve been
Why must we both go dancing again
Come join the dancing come join the waltz
Dont look too closely at my faults
Why cant I die here in your arms
Safe from the night and safe from the dawn
Back to the nothing that had no name
Back to the nowhere from where I came
Dont worry of me I know what I am
Where Im goin and where Ive been
Im not afraid Im not afraid
No Im not afraidA little dream castle with every dream gone
Is lonely and silent the shades are all drawn
And my heart is heavy as I gaze upon a cottage for sale
The lawn we were proud of is waving in hay
A beautiful garden has withered away
Where you planted roses the weeds seem to say A cottage for sale
From every single window I see your face
But when I reach the window theres empty space
The keys in the mailbox the same as before
But no one is waiting for me anymore
The end of our story is there on the door A cottage for saleSe vocÃª disser que eu desafino amor
Saiba que isso em mim provoca imensa dor
SÃ³ privilegiados tÃªm ouvido igual ao seu
Eu possuo apenas o que Deus me deu
Se vocÃª insisted em classificar
meu comportamento de antimusical
Eu mesmo mentindo Devo argumentar
Que isto Ã bossa nova Que isto Ã muito natural
O que vocÃª nÃo sabe nem sequer pressente
Ã que os desafinados tambÃm tÃªm um coraÃÃo
Fotografei vocÃª na minha Rolleyflex
Revelou-se a sua enorme ingratidÃo
SÃ³ nÃo poderÃ falar assim do meu amor
Este Ã o maior que vocÃª pode encontrarWe use to say our love will stay until the cows come home
And then the cows came home do you know why
We use to say well love this way till Hades freezes over
And then it just froze over do you know why
We thought we had a future dancing a jig for us
Do you suppose our little dream got too big for us
We use to say our love will stay
Forever and a night and now forevers gone
Darling do you know why Neither do II need your love so badly I love you oh so madly
But I dont stand a ghost of a chance with you
I thought at last Id found you but other lovers surround you
And I dont stand a ghost of a chance with you
If youd surrender just for a tender kiss or two
You might discover that Im the lover meant for you
And Id be true but whats the good of scheming
I know I must be dreamingYou better get up and do it now you better get up my friend and how
The land that you love the best is asking you to invest
With a personal request from mr morgenthau
Dig down deep to buy the bonds that buy the tanks
Palmers for our fighting yanks dig down deep
Dig down deep to buy the bonds that keep us free supply the sky the land and sea
Dig down deep put your hand on your gismo citizen everybody must do his part
Its the easiest piece that the citizen to show the world we finish what we start
Dig down deep the boys are giving all for you so the least that you can do
Is dig down deepDont worry bout me
Ill get along
Forget about me
Just be happy my love
Lets say that our little show is over
And so the story ends
Why not call it a day the sensible way
And still be friends
Look out for yourself
That should be the rule
Give your heart and your love
To whomever you love
Darlin dont be a fool
Why do we cling to this old faded thing
That used to be
So if you can forget
Then dont worry bout meDear heart wish you were here to warm this night
My dear heart it seems like a year since youve been out of my sight
A single room a table for one
Its a lonesome town all right
But soon Ill kiss you hello at our front door
And dear heart I want you to know
Ill leave your arms never more
A single room a table for one
Its a lonesome town all right
But soon Ill kiss you hello at our front door
And dear heart I want you to know
Ill leave your arms never moreI could have told you shed hurt you shed love you a while then desert you
If only you asked I could have told you so
I could have saved you some crying yes I could have told you shes lying
But you were in love and didnt want to know
I hear her now as I toss and turn and try to sleep
I hear her now making promises shell never keep
And soon its over and done with shell find someone new to have fun with
Through all of my tears I could have told you so
I hear her now as I toss and turn and try to sleep
I hear her now making promises shell never keep
And soon its over and done with shell find someone new to have fun with
Through all of my tears I could have told you soImagination is funny it makes a cloudy day sunny
Makes a bee think of honey just as I think of you
Imagination is crazy you whole perspective gets hazy
Starts you asking a daisy what to do what to do
Have you ever felt a gentle touch and then a kiss and then and then
Find its only your imagination again oh well
Imagination is silly you go around willy-nilly
For example I go around wanting you
And yet I cant imagine that you want me too
Imagination is silly you go around willy-nilly
For example I go around wanting you
And yet I cant imagine that you want me tooWay down among Brazilians
Coffee beans grow by the billions
So theyve got to find those extra cups to fill
Theyve got an awful lot of coffee in Brazil
You cant get cherry soda
Cause theyve got to fill that quota
And the way things are Ill bet they never will
Theyve got a zillion tons of coffee in Brazil
No tea or tomato juice
Youll see no potato juice
The planters down in Santos all say no no no
The politicians daughter
Was accused of drinking water
And was fined a great big fifty dollar bill
Theyve got an awful lot of coffee in Brazil
You date a girl and find out later
She smells just like a percolator
Her perfume was made right on the grill
Why they could percolate the ocean in Brazil
And when their ham and eggs need savor
Coffee ketchup gives em flavor
Coffee pickles way outsell the dill
Why they put coffee in the coffee in Brazil
So your lead to the local color
Serving coffee with a cruller
Dunking doesnt take a lot of skill
Theyve got an awful lot of coffee in BrazilDid i see moonlight and magnolia trees
Smile again my darling if you please
Did i hear music on a warm spring breeze
Speak again my darling if you please
Did i feel cool September rain just then
If you please touch my cheek with your hand again
When you are near me i can dream with ease
And Im yours my darling if you please
Did i feel cool September rain just then
If you please touch my cheek with your hand againIll never be the same
Stars have lost their meaning for me
Ill never be the same
Nothings what it once use to be
And when the songbirds that sing
Tell me its spring
I cant believe their song
Once love was king but kings can be wrong
Ill never be the same
There is such an ache in my heart
Never be the same since were apart
Though theres a lot that a smile may hide
I know down deep inside
Ill never be the same never be the same again
Ill never be the same never be the same againDeep night stars in the sky above
Moonlight lighting our place of love
Night winds seem to have gone to rest
Two eyes brightly with love are gleaming
Come to my arms my darling my sweetheart my own
Vow that youll love me always be mine alone
Deep night whispering trees above
Kind night bringing you nearer dearer and dearer
Deep night deep in the arms of love
Come to my arms my darling my sweetheart my own
Vow that youll love me always and be mine alone
Deep night whispering trees above
Kind night bringing you nearer dearer and dearer
Deep night deep in the arms of loveIn me you see a man aloneHeld by the habit of being on his ownA man who listens to the trembling of the treesWith sentimental ease In me you see a man aloneBehind the wall hes learned to call his homeA man who still goes walking in the rainExpecting love again A man not lonelyExcept when the dark comes onA man learning to live with memories of midnightsThat fell apart at dawn In me you see a man aloneDrinking up Sundays and spending them aloneAman who knows love is seldom what it seemsJust other peoples dreamsBefore we say good-bye forever come waltz with me come waltz with me - once more
Before we let love die forever come waltz with me the way we waltzed - before
Before our little world just crumbled and fell
And tumbled like a house of cards - to the floor
Before Im left to sigh forever and haunt the past - give me this last - encore
Oh darling come and waltz with me - once moreYou vowed your love from here to eternity
A love so true it never would die
You gave your lips gave them so willingly
How could I know your kiss meant goodbye
Now Im alone with only a memory
My empty arms will never know why
Though you are gone this love that you left with me
Will live from here to eternity
Now Im alone with only a memory
My empty arms will never know why
Though you are gone this love that you left with me
This endless desire
Will live from here to eternityIts very clear
Our love is here to stay
Not for a year but ever and a day
The radio
And the telephone
And the movies that we know
May just be passing fancies
And in time may go
But oh my dear
Our love is here to stay
Together were going a long long way
In time the Rockies may crumble
Gibraltar may tumble
Theyre only made of clay
But our love is here to stay
The radio
And the telephone
And the movies that we know
May just be passing fancies
And in time may go
But oh my dear
Our love is here to stay
Together were going a long long way
In time the Rockies may crumble
And Gibraltar it may tumble
Theyre only made of clay
But our love our love is here to stayGee but its tough to be broke kid
Its not a joke kid its a curse
My luck is changing its gotten from
simply rotten to something worse
Who knows some day I will win too
Ill begin to reach my prime
Now though I see what our end is
All I can spend is just my time

How deep is the ocean

How many times a day do i think of you
How many roses are sprinkled with dew
How far would i travel
To be where you are
How far is the journey
From here to a star
And if i ever lost you how much would i cry
How deep is the ocean

How far would i travel
To be where you are

From here to a star
And if i ever lost you how much would i cry

Im sorry sweetheart and yet
Though you shouldnt be lenient with me
I hope youll forgive and forget
What can I say dear after I say Im sorry
What can I do to prove it to you Im sorry
I didnt mean to ever be mean to you
If I didnt care I wouldnt feel like I do
I was all wrong but right or wrong I dont blame you
Why should I take somebody like you and shame you
I know that I made you cry and Im so sorry dear
So what can I say dear after I say Im sorry
You made me glad I made you sad
I made you lonesome and blue
And who ever knew
Whod ever think that I would be crying to you
What can I say dear after I say Im sorry
What can I do to prove it to you Im sorry
I didnt mean to ever be mean to you
If I didnt care I wouldnt feel like I do

And Ill give it right back to youLove is funny or its sad
Or its quiet or its mad
Its a good thing or its bad
But beautiful
Beautiful to take a chance
And if you fall you fall
And Im thinking I wouldnt mind at all
Love is tearful or its gay
Its a problem or its play
Its a heartache either way
But beautiful
And Im thinking if you were mine
Id never let you go
And that would be but beautiful I knowThis time we almost made the pieces fit
Didnt we
This time we almost made some sense of it
Didnt we
This time I had the answer right here in my hand
Then I touched it and it had turned to sand
This time we almost sang our song in tune
Didnt we love
This time we almost made it made it to the moon
Didnt we love
This time we almost made our poem rhyme
This time we almost made that long hard climb
Didnt we almost make it
Didnt we almost make it
Didnt we almost make it this timeI want to be around to pick up the pieces when somebody breaks your heart
Somebody twice as smart as i
Somebody who will swear to be true like you used to do with me
Wholl leave you to learn that misery loves company wait and see
I want to be around to see how he does it when he breaks your heart to bits
Lets see if the puzzle fits so fine
And thats when Ill discover that revenge is sweet
As I sit there applauding from a front row seat
When somebody breaks your heart like you broke mine
Thats when Ill discover that revenge is sweet
As I sit there applauding from a front row seat
When somebody breaks your heart like you broke mine
Like you like you broke mineI could show the world how to smile
I could be glad all of the while
I could change the grey skies to blues
If I had you
I could leave the old days behind
Leave all my pals Id never mind
I could start my life all a new
If I had you
I could climb the snow capped mountains
Sail the mighty ocean wide
I could cross the burning desert
If I had you by my side
I could be a king dear uncrowned
Humble or poor rich or renowned
There is nothing I couldnt do
If I had you
I could show the world how to smile
I could be glad all of the while
I could change the grey skies to blues
If I had you
I could leave the old days behind
Leave all my pals Id never mind
I could start my life all a new
If I had you
I could climb the snow capped mountains
Sail the mighty ocean wide
I could cross the burning desert
If I had you by my side
I could be a king dear uncrowned
Humble or poor rich or renowned
There is nothing I couldnt doI love you I love you
Is all that I can say
I love you I love you
The same old worlds Im saying in the same old way
I love you I love you
Three words that are divine
And now my dear Im waitin to hear
The words that will make you mine
Little girl I love you
Cant you see I love you
I love you Cant you see I love you
I love you I love you
Three words that are divine
And now my dear Im waitin to hear
The words that make you mineBlue moon you saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for
Someone I really could care for
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will hold
I heard somebody whisper Please adore me
And when I looked the moon had turned to gold
Blue moon
Now Im no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper please adore me
And when I looked the moon had turned to gold
Blue moon
Now Im no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon
Now Im no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my ownOh how am I to know
If its really love that found its grave here
Oh how am I to know
Will it linger on and leave me there
I dare not guess at this strange happiness
Oh how am I to know
Can it be that love has come to stay hereHow little we know
How much to discover
What chemical forces flow
From lover to lover
How little we understand what touches of that tingle
That sudden explosion when two tingles intermingle
Who cares to define
What chemistry this is
Who cares with your lips on mine
How ignorant bliss is
So long as you kiss me and the world around us shatters
How little it matters how little we know
How little we know how little we knowI could make you care if only youd let me
I could make you care youd never forget me
I cant resist Id be a fool to try
I know if once we kissed I could kiss my heart goodbye
I knew this was love the moment I found you
So I planned my life its built all around you
Give me this chance darling if you only would
I could make you care I know I couldWhen youre feeling sad and lonely theres a service I can render
Tell the one who loves you only I can be so warm and tender
Call me dont be afraid you can call me maybe its late but just call me
Call me and Ill be around
When its seems your friends desert you theres somebody thinking of you
Im the one wholl never hurt you maybe its because I love you
Call me dont be afraid you can call me maybe its late but just call me
Call me and Ill be around
Now dont forget me cause if you let me I will always stay by you
You got to trust me thats how it must be theres so much I can do
If you call Ill be right with you you and I should be together
Take this love I long to give you Ill die at your side forever call me call meI I who have nothing
I I who have no one adore you and want you so
Im just a no one with nothing to give you but oh
I love you
He he buys you diamonds bright bright sparkling diamonds
But believe me dear when I say
That he can give you the world
But hell never love you the way I love you
He can take you any place he wants
To fancy clubs and restaurants
But I can only watch you
With my nose pressed up against the window pane
I I who have nothing I I who have no one
Must watch you go dancing by
Wrapped in the arms of somebody else
When darling its I who loves you
I love you I love you I love youEvery day along about evening
When the sunlights beginning to pale
I ride through the slumbering shadows
Along the Navajo Trail
When its night and crickets are callin
And coyotes are makin a wail
I dream by a smoldering fire
Along the Navajo Trail
I love to lie and listen to the music
When the wind is strummin a sagebrush guitar
When over yonder hill the moon is climbin
It always finds me wishin on a star
Well what a ya know its mornin already
Theres the dawnin so silver and pale
Its time to climb into my saddle
And ride the Navajo Trail
I love to lie and listen to the music
When the wind is strummin a sagebrush guitar
When over yonder hill the moon is climbin
It always finds me wishin on a star
Well what a ya know its mornin already
Theres the dawnin so silver and pale like a silvery veil
Its time to climb into my saddleOh how am I to know if its really love that found its grave here
Oh how am I to know will it linger on and leave me there
I dare not guess at this strange happiness
Oh how am I to know can it be that love has come to stay hereHow do you keep the music playing
How do you make it last
How do you keep the song from fading
Too fast
How do you lose yourself to someone
And never lose your way
How do you not run out of new things
To say
And since you know were always changing
How can it be the same
And tell me how year after year
Youre sure your heart wont fall apart
Each time you hear his name
I know the way I feel for you is now or never
The more I love the more that Im afraid
That in your eyes I may not see forever forever
If we can be the best of lovers
Yet be the best of friends
If we can try with every day to make it better as it grows
With any luck than I suppose
The music never ends
I know how do you keep the music playing
The way I feel for you is now or never how do you make it last
The more I love the more that Im afraid
how do you keep the song from fading
That in your eyes I may not see forever
Keep the song from fading
Forever
If we can be the best of lovers
Yet be the best of friends
If we can try with every day to make it better as it goes
With any luck than I suppose
The music never endsDaisy is darling Iris is sweet
Lily is lovely Blossoms a treat
Of all the sweethearts - a guy could meet
Well I finally chose an American beauty rose
Camelias tragic she cant be mine
Magnolias magic it makes Maggie shine
Laurel will hug you Orchids divine
Still I finally chose an American beauty rose
Shes clingier than Ivy and shes zingier than black-eyed Susan
And springier than Mabel in June
Im daffy as a daffodil its laughable the way I thrill
When roses are in bloom
Pansy is pretty Willow is tall
Violets kisses tulips two lips recall Violets kiss is Tulips recall
How can I choose one I love em all
Still I finally chose an American beauty roseEmbrace me my sweet embraceable you
Embrace me you irreplaceable you
Just one look at you
My heart grew tipsy in me
You and you alone
Bring out the gypsy in me
I love all the many charms about you
Above all I want my arms about you
Dont be a naughty baby
Come to papa come to papa do
My sweet embraceable youEverybody loves somebody sometime
Everybody falls in love somehow
Something in your kiss just told me
That My sometime is now
Everybody finds somebody someplace
Theres no telling where love may appear
Something in my heart keeps saying
That My someplace is here
If I had it in my power
Id arrange for every girl to have your charm
Then every minute every hour
Every boy would find what Ive found in your arms
Everybody loves somebody sometime
And although my dream was overdue
Your love made it well worth waiting
For someone like youThe second spot in our Fame And Fortune Show
Is always saved for the romantic Frank Sinatra
Take Franks voice and a swell ballad like this one
And you have the perfect twosome
Franklin I give you my word
I give you my word Ill never love again
I give you my word this is my first and last romance
I gave my lips my heart and soul to you
My heart will break if you dont take me too
I give you my word you are the only one
All heaven has heard what your love has done
Darling whats the good of life without love or love without you
Ill never change I give you my wordThe sleepless nights the daily fights
The quick toboggan when you reach the heights
I miss the kisses and I miss the bites
I wish I were in love again
The broken dates the endless waits
The lovely loving and the hateful hates
The conversation with the flying plates
I wish I were in love again
Chorus
No more pain no more strain
Now Im sane but I would rather be punch-drunk
The pulled out fur of cat and cur
The fine mis-mating of a him and her
Ive learned my lesson but I wish I were in love again
The furtive sigh the blackened eye
The words Ill love you til the day I die
The self-deception that believes the lie
I wish I were in love again
When love congeals it soon reveals
The faint aroma of performing seals
The double-crossing of a pair of heels
I wish I were in love again
ChorusMc jo stafford and the pied pipers sing how come you do me like you do
How come you do me like you do do do
How come you do me like you do
Why do you try to make me feel so blue
Ive done nothing to you
Do me right or else just let me be
cause I can beat you doing what youre doing to me
How come you do me like you do do do
How come you do me like you doNever thought Id fall
But now I hear love call
Im getting sentimental over you
Things you say and do
Just thrill me through and through
Im getting sentimental over you
I thought I was happy
I could live without love
Now I must admit
Love is all Im thinking of
Wont you please be kind
And just make up your mind
That youll be sweet gentle
Be gentle with me
Because Im sentimental over youTear a star from out the sky
And the sky feels blue
Tear a petal from a rose
And the rose weeps too
Take your heart away from mine
And mine will surely break
My life is yours to make
So please keep the spark awake
Would you take the wings from birds
So that they cant fly
Would you take the oceans roar
And leave just a sigh
All this your heart wont let you do
This is what I beg of you
Dont take your love from meHow glad the many millions of Annabelles and Lillians
Would be to capture me
But you had such persistence you wore down my resistance
I fell and it was swell
Im your big and brave and handsome Romeo
How I won you I shall never never know
Its not that youre attractive
But oh my heart grew active
When you came into view
Ive got a crush on you sweetie pie
All the day and night time give me sigh
I never had the least notion that
I could fall with so much emotion
Could you coo could you care
For a cunning cottage we could share
The world will pardon my mush
Cause I have got a crush my baby on youIn the blue of evening when you appear close to me dear one
There in the dusk well share a dream reverie
In the blue of evening while crickets call and stars are falling
There neath the midnight sky youll come to me
In the shadows of the night well stand Ill touch your hand
And then softly as your lovely eyes entreat our lips will meet again
In the blue of evening night winds above whisper I love you
There will we find romance in the blue of eveningI hadnt anyone
Till you
I was a lonely one
Till you
I used to lie awake and wonder
If there could be
A someone in this wide world
Just made for me
And now I see
I had to save my love
For you
I never gave my love
Till you
And through my lonely heart demanding it
Cupid took a hand in it
I hadnt anyone
Till you
And through my lonely heart demanding it
Cupid took a hand in it
I hadnt anyone
Till youIn the still of the night
As i gaze out of my window
At the moon in its flight
My thoughts all stray stray to you
In the still of the night
While the world lies in slumber
Oh the times without number
When i say to you
Do you love me
Just like i love you
Are you my life to be
That dream come true
Or will this dream of mine
Will it fade way out of sight
Just like that moon growing dim
Way out on the rim of the hill
In the still of the nightWhen somebody loves you
Its no good unless he loves you all the way
All the way
Happy to be near you when you need someone to cheer you
All the way
Taller than the tallest tree is
Thats how its got to feel
Deeper than the deep blue sea is
Thats how deep it goes if its real
When somebody needs you
Its no good unless he needs you all the way
Through the good or lean years
And for all the in-between years
Come what way
Who know where the road will lead us
Only a fool would say
But if youll let me love you
Its for sure Im gonna love you
All the way
All the wayFly me to the moon
Let me play among the stars
Let me see what spring is like on
A-Jupiter and Mars
In other words hold my hand
In other words baby kiss me
Fill my heart with song and let me sing for ever more
You are all I long for
All I worship and adore
In other words please be true
In other words I love you
Fill my heart with song
Let me sing for ever more
You are all I long for all I worship and adore
In other words please be true
In other words
In other words
I love youYou see a pair of laughing eyes
And suddenly your sighing sighs
Youre thinking nothings wrong
You string along boy then snap
Those eyes those sighs theyre part of the tender trap
Youre hand in hand beneath the trees
And soon theres music in the breeze
Youre acting kind of smart until your heart just goes wap
Those trees that breeze theyre part of the tender trap
Some starry night when her kisses make you tingle
Shell hold you tight and youll hate yourself for being single
And all at once it seems so nice
The folks are throwing shoes and rice
You hurry to a spot thats just a dot on the map
Youre hooked youre cooked youre caught in the tender trap
Some starry night when her kisses make you tingle
Shell hold you tight and youll hate yourself for being single
And all at once it seems so nice
The folks are throwing shoes and rice
You hurry to a spot thats just a dot on the map
And then you wonder how it all came about
Its too late now theres no gettin out
You fell in love and love is the tender trapFrank

Thats the only one I ever had
Baby baby doncha go away mad
Cheatin shows and it never goes
You got a reason to be mad I suppose
But she only was a passin fad
Baby dont you be mad
Her kinds a dime a dozen
And thats not the kind I want
Whod ever dream your cousin
Would wander into that restaurant
I understand that you feel upset
What do you say that you forgive and forget
Come on and kiss me just to show youre glad
Baby baby doncha go away mad
Now her kinds a dime a dozen
I shouldve passed her by
Whod ever dream your cousin
Would come along and give us the eye
I understand that you feel upset
What do you say that you forgive and forget
Come on and kiss me just to show youre glad
Baby doncha go away mad
Understand that youre quite upset
What do you say that you forgive and forget
Come on and kiss me just to show youre glad
Baby baby baby baby baby baby baby
Baby baby baby doncha go way mad
Now doncha go away madOut of the tree of life I just picked me a plum
You came along and everything started to hum
Still its a real good bet the best is yet to come
The best is yet to come and wont that be fine
You think youve seen the sun but you aint seen it shine
Wait till the warm-up is underway
Wait till out lips have met
Wait till you see that sunshine day
You aint seen nothin yet
The best is yet to come and wont that be fine
The best is yet to come come the day that your mine
Come the day that your mine
Im gonna teach you to fly
Weve only tasted the wine
Were gonna drain that cup dry
Wait till your charms are right for the arms to surround
You think youve flown before but you aint left the ground
Wait till youre locked in my embrace
Wait till I hold you near
Wait till you see that sunshine place
There aint nothin like it here
The best is yet to come and wont that be fine
The best is yet to come come the day that your mineCome fly with me lets fly lets fly away
If you can use some exotic booze
Theres a bar in far Bombay
Come fly with me lets fly lets fly away
Come fly with me lets float down to Peru
In llama-land theres a one-man band
And hell toot his flute for you
Come fly with me lets take off in the blue
Once I get you up there
Where the air is rarefied
Well just glide
Starry-eyed
Once I get you up there
Ill be holding you so near
You may hear
Angels cheer cause were together
Weather-wise its such a lovely day
Just say the words and well beat the birds
Down to Acapulco Bay
It is perfect for a flying honeymoon they say
Come fly with me lets fly lets fly away
Once I get you up there
Where the air is rarefied
Well just glide
Starry-eyed
Once I get you up there
Ill be holding you so near
You may hear
Angels cheer cause were together
Weather-wise its such a lovely day
You just say the words and well beat the birds
Down to Acapulco Bay
Its perfect for a flying honeymoon they say
Come fly with me lets fly lets fly
Pack up lets fly awayI was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had the feeling of self-pity
What to do
What to do
What to do
The outlook was decidedly blue
But as I walked through the dreary streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day Ive known
A foggy day
In London town
It had me low
And it had me down
I viewed the morning
With much alarm
The British Museum
Had lost its charm
How long I wondered
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles
It hadnt past
For suddenly
I saw you standing right there
And in foggy London town
The sun was shining shining shining shining shining everywhere
How long I wondered
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles
It hadnt past
For suddenly
I saw you standing right there
And in foggy London town
The sun was shining everywhereIn the wee small hours of the morning
While the whole wide world is fast asleep
You lie awake and think about the girl
And never ever think of counting sheep
When your lonely heart has learned its lesson
Youd be hers if only she would call
In the wee small hours of the morning
Thats the time you miss her most of all
When your lonely heart has learned its lesson
Youd be hers if only she would call
In the wee small hours of the morning
Thats the time you miss her most of allWhen somebody loves you
Its no good unless he loves you all the way
All the way
Happy to be near you when you need someone to cheer you
All the way
Taller than the tallest tree is
Thats how its got to feel
Deeper than the deep blue sea is
Thats how deep it goes if its real
When somebody needs you
Its no good unless he needs you all the way
Through the good or lean years
And for all the in-between years
Come what way
Who know where the road will lead us
Only a fool would say
But if youll let me love you
Its for sure Im gonna love you
All the way
All the wayTHE TENDER TRAP
Sammy Cahnvan Heusen
You see a pair of laughing eyes
And suddenly your sighing sighs
Youre thinking nothings wrong
You string along boy then snap
Those eyes those sighs theyre part of the tender trap
Youre hand in hand beneath the trees
And soon theres music in the breeze
Youre acting kind of smart until your heart just goes wap
Those trees that breeze theyre part of the tender trap
Some starry night when her kisses make you tingle
Shell hold you tight and youll hate yourself for being single
And all at once it seems so nice
The folks are throwing shoes and rice
You hurry to a spot thats just a dot on the map
Youre hooked youre cooked youre caught in the tender trap
Some starry night when her kisses make you tingle
Shell hold you tight and youll hate yourself for being single
And all at once it seems so nice
The folks are throwing shoes and rice
You hurry to a spot thats just a dot on the map
And then you wonder how it all came about
Its too late now theres no getting out
You fell in love and love is the tender trapFly me to the moon
Let me play among those stars
Let me see what spring is like
On Jupiter and Mars
In other words hold my hand
In other words baby kiss me
Fill my heart with song
Let me sing for ever more
You are all I long for
All I worship and adore
In other words please be true
In other words I love youBe careful its my heart
Its not my watch youre holding its my heart
Its not the note that I sent you that you quickly burn
Its not the book I lent you that you never return
Remember its my heart
The heart with which so willingly I part
Its yours to take to keep or break but please before you start
Be careful remember its my heart
Remember
Its my heart
This heart with which so willingly I part
Its yours to take to keep or break but please before you start
Be careful be careful
Be careful its my heartHave you met Miss Jones someone said as we shook hands
She was just Miss Jones to me
And then I said Miss Jones youre a girl who understands
Im a man who must be free
And all at once I lost my breath and all at once was scared to death
And all at once I owned the earth and sky
And now Ive met Miss Jones and well keep on meeting till we die
Miss Jones and I
And all at once I lost my breath and all at once was scared to death
And all at once I owned the earth and the sky
Now Ive met Miss Jones and well keep on meeting till we die
Miss Jones and I Miss Jones and I Miss Jones and IWay down among Brazilians
Coffee beans grow by the billions
So theyve got to find those extra cups to fill
Theyve got an awful lot of coffee in Brazil
You cant get cherry soda
Cause theyve got to fill that quota
And the way things are Ill bet they never will
Theyve got a zillion tons of coffee in Brazil
No tea or tomato juice
Youll see no potato juice
The planters down in Santos all say no no no
The politicians daughter
Was accused of drinking water
And was fined a great big fifty dollar bill
Theyve got an awful lot of coffee in Brazil
You date a girl and find out later
She smells just like a percolator
Her perfume was made right on the grill
Why they could percolate the ocean in Brazil
And when their ham and eggs need savor
Coffee ketchup gives em flavor
Coffee pickles way outsell the dill
Why they put coffee in the coffee in Brazil
So your lead to the local color
Serving coffee with a cruller
Dunking doesnt take a lot of skill
Theyve got an awful lot of coffee in BrazilAnytime you need me babe just call Ill be there
Call and see what a good friend can be
When you need someone to care
Nothing more than understanding just a man whos undemanding
Like a leaf thats only landing suddenly goes when the wind gently blows
And Im asking nothing of you love only what you want to give
And I wish you what I wish myself ss long as I may live
Other arms will surely hold you just remember the things that I told you
When these arms of mine enfold you
Its not out of greed but for love and for need
I love you so I still do Im sure you know when Im holding you
The sad part of seeing you is goodbye
Call and Ill come when your worlds come undone
Im like you I get lonely too and I need someone to hold
Knowing well this world can be hell and sometimes very cold
Nothing firm and nothing binding now and then a slight reminding
Waking up one day and finding somewhere to run somewhere to run
Somewhere to run when your worlds come undone
Oh babe Ill be there Ill be there anytime
Theres a certain thing about you summer fall and spring about you
I could write and sing about you and never run out never run out no
Never run out of what youre all about
Oh babe Ill be there Ill be there anytimeI was five and he was six
We rode on horses made of sticks
He wore black and I wore white
He would always win the fight
Bang bang he shot me down
Bang bang I hit the ground
Bang bang that awful sound
Bang bang my baby shot me down
Seasons came and changed the time
When I grew up I called him mine
He would always laugh and say
Remember when we used to play
Bang bang I shot you down
Bang bang you hit the ground
Bang bang that awful sound
Bang bang I used to shoot you down
Music played and people sang
Just for me the church bells rang
Now hes gone I dont know why
And till this day sometimes I cry
He didnt even say goodbye
He didnt take the time to lieWhen they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green
Im with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestras playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine
To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are swearing to love forever
And promising never never to part
What moments divine what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean
So dont let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine
Oh yes let them begin the beguine make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more
Darling I love you
And we suddenly know what heaven were in
When they begin the beguineFools rush in where angels fear to tread
And so I come to you my love my heart above my head
Though I see the danger there
If theres a chance for me then I dont care
Fools rush in where wise men never go
But wise men never fall in love
So how are they to know
When we met I felt my life begin
So open up your heart and let this fool rush inS wonderful s marvelous you should care for me
S awfully nice s paradise s what I love to see
You made my life so glamorous
You cant blame me for feeling amorous
Oh s wonderful s marvelous that you should care for me
S wonderful that you should care for meIt started out like a song we started quiet and slow with no surprise
Then one morning I woke to realize we have a good thing going
Its not that nothing went wrong some angry moment of course but just a few
And only moments no more because we knew we had a good thing going
And if I wanted too much was that such a mistake
Half the time you never wanted enough oh wake up I dont make that a crime
And while its going along you take for granted some love will wear away
We took for granted a lot and still I say it could have kept on growing
Instead of just kept on we had a good thing going going gone
Musical interlude
And if I wanted too much was that such a mistake
Half the time you never wanted enough oh wake up I dont make that a crime
And while its going along you take for granted some love will wear away
We took for granted a lot and still I say it could have kept on going
Instead of just kept on we had a good thing going going goneFly me to the moon
Let me play among the stars
Let me see what spring is like on
A-Jupiter and Mars
In other words hold my hand
In other words baby kiss me
Fill my heart with song and let me sing for ever more
You are all I long for
All I worship and adore
In other words please be true
In other words I love you
Fill my heart with song
Let me sing for ever more
You are all I long for all I worship and adore
In other words please be true
In other words
In other words
I love youAll or nothing at all
Half a love never appealed to me
If your heart never could yield to me
Then Id rather rather have nothin at all
All or nothing at all
If its love there aint no in-between
Why begin then cry for somethin that might have been
No Id rather rather have nothing at all
Oh please dont bring your lips close to my cheek
Dont you smile or Ill be lost beyond recall
The kiss in your eyes the touch of your hand makes me weak
And my heart may grow very dizzy and fall
And if I fell under the spell of your call
I would be caught in the undertow
And so you see Ive got to say no no
All or nothing at allOut of the tree of life I just picked me a plum
You came along and everythings startin to hum

Who ever dreamed this could happen
To someone supposed to be smart

This is too good to be true but so was that kiss
I know by the way my heart leaps
That this time Im playing for keeps
Yes Ive had this feeling before
Darling but never like thisBlue lace her gown was blue lace
She wore the promise of springtime and laughter
Daybreak we talked till daybreak
Without a warning of what might come after
Her touch was velvet I still can feel it
That one brief moment that ended in space
Sometime in mid-December
I hear the music the echo of springtime laughter
All day I see the old days
When Id seen the young girls in blue blue lace
Her gown was blue lace such lovely blue lace
Her gown was blueWhere there is sunrise there is Barbara only Barbara clothes that way
Where there is laughter there is Barbara always Barbara warm and gay
And when theres music she is the song the song Im singing my whole life long
Theres no one just like her like Barbara only Barbara is so rare
Wherever she is Ill be there
Theres no one just like her like Barbara only Barbara shes so rare
Wherever she is Ill be thereFeelin kinda Sunday feelin kinda Sunday feelin kinda Sunday

The land that you love the best is asking you to invest
With a personal request from mr morgenthau
Dig down deep to buy the bonds that buy the tanks
Palmers for our fighting yanks dig down deep
Dig down deep to buy the bonds that keep us free supply the sky the land and sea

Wherever I walk the people all talk
And theyre saying its time that I knew
But I dont believe in rumors darling
I want it straight from you
For everyone knows how a rumor grows
When the gossips are doing their worst
But somehow I feel if the stories were real
You would have come to me first
Whatever they say and say what they may
Still it isnt a thing you would do
So I wont believe in rumors darling
I want it straight from you
For everyone knows how a rumor grows
When the gossips are doing their worst
But somehow I feel if the stories were real
You would have come to me first
So whatever they say and say what they may
Still it isnt a thing you would do
So I wont believe in rumors darling

You to dream theres always a chance
As long as theres music whatever the song
As long as theres music for sweethearts to sing
Ill sing you my love melodies of the birds on the wing
My loneliest days will never seem long
As long as theres music and you are the song
As long as theres music for sweethearts to sing
Ill sing you my love melodies of the birds on the wing
My loneliest days will never seem long
As long as theres music and you are the songI could have married Imogene or Josephine or Mame
And I could have married Sally Lou or lets see whats her name
But I thought and thought and thought
And thought and now my hearts at rest
Cause I have picked out two of them and you can have the rest
I got a gal I love in North and South Dakota
There aint no difference in my love not one iota
I guess that two gals puts me one above the quota
Still I got a gal in North and South Dakota
Ooh ooh wish I knew which of my two loves is true
I got a gal I love in North and South Dakota
There aint no difference in my love not one iota
Just wait till they hear about the gal in Minnesota
Its a situation partner that vexes
Guess I go back to the gal I love in Texas
I guess Ive even lost that gal in Minnesota
Its a situation partner that vexes
If I had the nerve I could go back to Texas
Ooh ooh guess Ill go back to the gal I love in Texas
Hey Pedro IncomprehensibleSoftly I will leave you softly
For my heart would break
If you should wake and see me go
So I leave you softly long before you miss me
Long before your arms can beg me stay
For one more hour or one more day
After all the years I cant bear the tears to fall
So softly as I leave you there
Softly long before you kiss me
Long before your arms can beg me stay
For one more hour
Or one more day
After all the years I cant bear the tears to fall
So softly as I leave you there
As I leave I you there
As I leave I you thereCatana what goddess gave you the name
That has this heart of mine so a flame
Tell me Catana what heaven gave you your eyes
What elfin fiddler plays for your sighs
Fashioned of Venus that is your form and your face
Two clinging vines for arms hold me in tender embrace
While the mood poses from lips made of roses
Each word opposes all else but love
Catana like a Madonna you Ill adore forevermore
While the mood poses from lips made of roses
Each word opposes all else but love
Catana like a Madonna you Ill adore forevermoreAnytime anytime you want me honey just let me know
When you need affection and youre looking for somewhere to go

Cause anytime you call me baby Ill come running straight to you

When every night your loved one holds you tight
Oo la la la seeest magnifique
But when one day your loved one drifts away
Oo la la la it is so tragique
But when once more she whispers
Je tadorecest magnifiqueFull moon and empty arms
The moon is there for us to share
But where are you
A night like this could weave a memory
And every kiss could start a dream for two
Full moon and empty arms
Tonight Ill use the magic moon
To wish upon
And next full moon
If my one wish comes true
My empty arms will be filled with you
Full moon and empty arms
Tonight Ill use the magic moon
To wish upon
And next full moon
If my one wish comes true
My empty arms will be filled with youIn her sweet little Alice blue gown
When she first wandered down into town
She was both proud and shy as she felt every eye
And in every shop window she primp passing by
Then in manner of fashion shed frown
And the world seemed to smile all around
Till it wilted she wore it shell always adore it
Her sweet little Alice blue gownI thought I knew the magic of you
And then you kissed me
Dear when you kissed me
I simply stood there and gazed completely amazed
I walked around both feet on the ground
And then you kissed me
Dear when you kissed me
I found myself on a cloud apart from the crowd
I had nothing to glow about
You came by
Now I know all theres to know about
Things like stars in the sky
I will confess I thought for awhile
That youd resist me
But then you kissed me
And now Im in love
I will confess I thought for awhile
That youd resist me
But then you kissed me
And now Im in love
You kissed me
And now Im in loveBaubles bangles hear how they jing jinga-linga
Baubles bangles bright shiny beads
Sparkles spangles your heart will sing singa-linga
Wearin baubles bangles and beads
Youll glitter and gleam so
Make somebody dream so that
Some day he may buy you a ring ringa-linga
Ive heard thats where it leads
Wearin baubles bangles and beads
Baubles bangles hear how they jing jinga-linga
Baubles bangles all those bright shiny beads
Sparkles spangles your heart will sing singa-linga

Ive heard that thats where it leads
If youre wearin baubles bangles and them cool cool beadsIll see you again whenever spring breaks through again
Time may lie heavy between but what has been is past forgetting
Your sweet memory across the years will come to me
Though my world may go awry in my heart twill ever lie
Just the echo of a sigh goodbye
All my life I shall remember knowing you
All the pleasures that I found in showing you
The different ways that one may face
The changing light and changing shade
Happiness that must die melodies that must fly
Memories that must fade dusty and forgotten bye and byeIt started out like a song we started quiet and slow with no surprise
Then one morning I woke to realize we have a good thing going
Its not that nothing went wrong some angry moment of course but just a few
And only moments no more because we knew we had a good thing going
And if I wanted too much was that such a mistake
Half the time you never wanted enough oh wake up I dont make that a crime
And while its going along you take for granted some love will wear away
We took for granted a lot and still I say it could have kept on growing
Instead of just kept on we had a good thing going going gone

And if I wanted too much was that such a mistake

And while its going along you take for granted some love will wear away
We took for granted a lot and still I say it could have kept on going
Instead of just kept on we had a good thing going going goneGive her sunshine in your smile
Give her pleasure all the while
Turn her thoughts from clouds of gray
Give her strength to face each day
Give her laughter be her friend
Stay beside her till the end
But in giving all else above
Dont forget to give her love
But in giving all else above
Dont forget to give her loveCant you just see yourself in a gingham gown
Little pink ribbons tied in your hair
Sitting there by my side when we ride through town
Folksll turn around oh how theyll tell
Cant you just see yourself on a porch with me
Watching a show that stars give for free
One little word can do it so say the word
And well have dozens of chicks a house in the sticks
Where people are glad to be known as hicks
Cant you just see yourself in love with me
Cant you just see yourself on a porch with me
Watching a show that stars give for free
One little word can do it so say the word
And well have dozens of chicks a house in the sticks
Where people are glad to be known as hicks
Cant you just see yourself in love with meIll follow my secret heart my whole life through
Ill keep all my dreams apart till one comes true
No matter what price is paid what stars may fade above
Ill follow my secret heart till I find love
Ill keep all my dreams apart till one comes true
No matter what price is paid what stars may fade above
Ill follow my secret heart till I find loveHow I love the kisses of Dolores
Aye aye aye Dolores
Not Marie or Emily or Doris
Only my Dolores
From a balcony above me
She whispers love me and throws a rose
Ah but she is twice as lovely
As the rose she throws
I would die to be with my Dolores
Aye aye aye Dolores
I was made to serenade Dolores
Just imagine eyes like moon rise
A voice like music lips like wine
What a break if I could make Dolores
Mine all mine
I would die to be with my Dolores
Aye aye aye Dolores
I was made to serenade Dolores
Just imagine eyes like moon rise
A voice like music lips like wine
What a break if I could make Dolores
Mine all mineBlue skies look up look up smilin at me
Take the azure in the dome boy
Nothin but blue skies its mellow fellow do I see
Blue skies blue skies
Bluebirds did you ever singin a song
Hear the bluebirds singin the blues
Nothin but bluebirds you wont say no all day long
The happy little birds flap flap happy
Sunshine everywhere and everybodys happy
As a square at the fair hoy hoy
All the days are hurryin by
When youre in love my how they fly
Blue days talk about blue
All of them gone makes no misery hmm hmm
Nothin but blue skies overhead
From now on Mister Elman go ahead go aheadCrazy love people say Im crazy in love
Just a fool sighing sighs to the skies up above
It isnt normal or real to feel heavens right inside your door
But somehow thats how I feel and Ive never felt this way before
Crazy dreams keep me clinging to this affair
Im insane to keep dreaming that you could care
But I am a kind of a fool who stayed after school
Ive learned my lessons well
And if this crazy love is such a crazy love Im glad I fellHave you ever passed the corner of Forth and Grand
Where a little ball o rhythm has a shoe-shine stand
People gather round and they clap their hands
Hes a great big bundle o joy
He pops the boogie woogie rag
The Chattanoogie shoe-shine boy
He charges you a nickel just to shine one shoe
He makes the oldest kind o leather look like new
You feel as though you want to dance when he gets through
Hes a great big bundle o joy he pops the boogie woogie rag
The Chattanoogie shoe-shine boy
Its a wonder that the rag dont tear the way he makes it pop
You ought to see him fan the air
With his hoppity-hippity-hippity-hoppity-hoppity-hippity-hop
He opens up for business when the clock strikes nine
He likes to get up early when theyre feelin fine
Everybody gets a little rise n shine with the great big bundle o joy
He pops the boogie woogie rag the Chattanoogie shoe-shine boy
instrumental break
Its a wonder that the rag dont tear the way he makes it pop
Just listen to him fan the air here he goes
He opens up for business when the clock strikes nine
He likes to get up early when theyre feelin fine
Everybody gets a little rise n shine with the great big bundle o joy
He pops the boogie woogie rag the Chattanoogie shoe-shine boy
The Chattanoogie shoe-shine boyI begged her I pleaded I told her
Baby come out of your shell

Not like this then I finally got my kiss
I begged her I pleaded I told her

Or a gallery full of ghosts
Or like givin a great big party
Where nobody shows but the host
Thats what its been like baby
Thats what its been like all night
Without you around to applaud me
Every nights just like closing night
And Im singin singin the same old numbers
An Im tellin the same sad jokes
And theres nothin out front but memries
And lot of transparent folks
So please call call and make a reservation
In our favorite spot for two
Cause Im singin to empty tables without you
Without you
Without youEvery night about this time oh how I miss you
I drift into our old rendezvous
Every night about this time the gang keeps on askin why youre not around
And I keep pretendin that youre just out of town
Every night about this time memories haunt me
Wondering too whos dancing with you
Every night about this time
And whenever they croon our favorite tune
A tear falls with every rhyme oh how I miss you
Every night about this time
Every night about this time memories haunt me
Wondering too whos dancing with you
Every night about this time
And whenever they croon our favorite tuneLong night its a long night my friend
The barrooms and the back streets dead end
Sometimes I thought I saw the sunrise and good times in the air
It was just it was just another big town with midnights neon glare
Long night its a long night I know
The bus rides and the nowhere to go
Ive seen what the street corners do to things like love and dreams
Seen what the bottle can do to a man with his hopes and his schemes
A long night what a long night it has been
The wheelers and the dealers they win
Ive tasted the ninety-proof gin and chased it away with the blues
I rarely paid debts that I owed but I sure have paid my duesTake it from me dont be a do-badder up
Do-badder up do bother to put your foot up
That ladder that leads you to that place
Below and every day you lose other you
Feel sadder you get madder so use the other
Step ladder you climb the other way
Scrapping and fighting scratching and fighting
Cheating and acting selfish makes your heart
Like a part of the hardest heart so selfish
Take it from me dont you be a do-badder up
A do-badder up a do-badder up just step up for that
Step ladder and climb the other waySomeone said drink the water but I will drink the wine
Someone said take a poor man rich dont have a dime
So fool yourselves if you will I just havent got the time
If you can drink the water I will drink the wine
Someone gave me some small flowers I held them in my hand
I looked at them for several hours I didnt understand
So fool yourselves if you will you can hold out your hand
Ill give back your flowers and I will take the land
And I will drink the wine
Sometimes Im very very lonely theres only me to care
And when Im very very lonely I want someone to share
Im going to drink the wine Im gonna take my time
And believe in a world that is mine
Someone gave me flowers held them in my hand
Looked at them for many hours didnt understand
Go on and fool yourselves if you will you can hold out your hand
Ill give back your flowers and I will take the land
And I will drink the wine and I will take the land
I will drink the wineFive hundred guys have one thousand eyes for my baby
They stand around and stare no matter where she goes
Five hundred men have one great big yen for my baby
Theyd like to buy her things like diamond rings and clothes
I really had to overcome a lot of competition
And Im not telling how I reached my number one position
But four ninety nine are wasting their time with my baby
And heres the reason why they have my sympathy
Cause baby she got eyes for me
Five hundred guys have one thousand eyes for my baby
They stand around and stare no matter where she goes
Five hundred men have one great big yen for my baby
Theyd like to buy her things like diamond rings and clothes
I really had to overcome a gang of competition
And Im not telling how I reached my number one position
But four ninety nine and they are wasting their time with my baby
And heres the reason why they have my sympathy
Cause baby has two eyes great big bright two eyes
Baby just has eyes for me my baby just has eyes for meEvery day along about evening
When the sunlights beginning to pale
I ride through the slumbering shadows
Along the Navajo Trail
When its night and crickets are callin
And coyotes are makin a wail
I dream by a smoldering fire
Along the Navajo Trail
I love to lie and listen to the music
When the wind is strummin a sagebrush guitar
When over yonder hill the moon is climbin
It always finds me wishin on a star
Well what a ya know its mornin already
Theres the dawnin so silver and pale
Its time to climb into my saddle
And ride the Navajo Trail
I love to lie and listen to the music
When the wind is strummin a sagebrush guitar
When over yonder hill the moon is climbin
It always finds me wishin on a star
Well what a ya know its mornin already
Theres the dawnin so silver and pale like a silvery veil
Its time to climb into my saddleIf its the last thing I do Ill make you mine
Darling the first thing is you in my design
Just like the stars guard the moon above me
Thats just how Ill guard our love so love me
Please love me
If its the last thing I do Ill take your hand
And though I wont say a word youll understand
Ill build a dream just for two
And then Ill make it come true
If its the very last thing I do
Just like the stars guard the moon above me
Thats just how Ill guard our love so love me
Please love me
If its the last thing I do Ill take your hand
And though I wont say a word youll understand
Ill build a dream just for twoIf I only had a match then my cares Id soon forget
All Id need would be a match if I had a cigarette
If I had a cigarette I could watch the smoke rings curl
But Id really be all set if I only had a girl
If I had someone like you to hurry to each night
In a cozy bungalow wed know such sweet delight
We could raise a family and a little garden patch
And to think this all could be if I only had a match
If I had someone like you to hurry to each night
In a cozy bungalow wed know such sweet delight
We could raise a family and a little garden patch
And to think this all could be if I only had a matchHands across the table
While the lights are low
Though you hush your lips
Your finger tips
Tell me all I want to know
Hands across the table
Meet so tenderly
And they say
In their little way
That you belong to meIm sorry dear so sorry dear
Im sorry I made you cry
Wont you forget wont you forgive
Dont let us say goodbye
One little word one little smile
One little kiss wont you try
It breaks my heart to hear you sigh
Im sorry I made you cry
Im sorry dear so sorry dear
Im sorry I made you cry
Wont you forget wont you forgive
Dont let us say goodbye
One little word one little smile
One little kiss wont you try
It breaks my heart to hear you sigh
Im sorry I made you cryEast of the sun and west of the moon
Well build a dream house of love dear
Near to the sun in the day near to the moon at night
Well live in a lovely way dear living our love in pale moonlight
Just you and I
Forever and a day
Love will not die
Well keep it that way
Up among the stars well find
A harmony of life to a lovely tune
East of the sun and west of the moon yes
East of the sun west of the moonEverybody has the right to be wrong at least once
Everybody has the right to be dunce-like once-like
Not being too smart is is no disgrace
What sets you apart is smilin with egg on your face
Its naive to make believe that youre right its not bright
Only fools go walking on thin ice twice
You and life can skip the strife and youll both get along
All it takes is simply saying youre wrong when youre wrong
And everybody has the right to be wrong
brief musical interlude
You and life can skip the strife and youll both get along
All it takes is simply sayin youre wrong when youre wrong
And everybody has the right to be
It can be a real delight to be
And Id fight fight for the right to be wrongIf I steal a kiss dear Ill surely return it someday
If I steal your dreams dear Ill bring them back some way
If I steal your moonlight Ill bring it back more divine
But if I steal your heart dear Ill keep it close to mine
If I steal your moonlight Ill bring it back more divine
And if I steal your heart dear Ill keep it close to mine
Ill keep it close to mineAnd I got the song of the robin
And I got a roof in the sky
Wonder why my heart keeps a throbbing a throbbing
A son of Gods country am I
And I got the flames and the mountains
And that treasures mine if I try
One by one my blessings Im counting and counting
A son of Gods country am I
I got the sun up in the sky the streams when Im dry
The fruit on the boughs of the trees
The clouds bringing me rain the fields giving me grain
Thanks to the Maker for these
And I got a loved one who loves me
Kids to make my cares hurry by
I may not be in heaven but I cant be far away
A son of Gods country am ISome say its just the nature of the beast
When you love somebody so passionately
Time has a way of stealing
That raging fire feeling
Leaving the ashes laying at your feet
Those fools of little faith will never know
That higher place two hearts can go
Where time is standing still
And love will burn until
The heavens and the earth have come and gone
This fire inside for you is constant as the northern star
And you will be forever in my heart
As long as theres a river searching for an endless sea
I will always love you
Faithfully
Tonight well raise a glass to lovers
Across the ages
Well hold each other
And toast to the day
When historys said and done
And we still stand as one
Some things were never meant to fade awayIll make up for everything the world has done to you
Ill make every little dream you ever dreamed come true
I will help you to forget you ever shed a tear
Should dark clouds become a threat then youll find me near
Well share all the rainy days that fate may have in store
Laugh a lot and darling what is more -
We will find the peace of mind that happiness can bring
Cause Ill make up for everything
And we will find the peace of mind that happiness can bring
Cause Ill make up for everythingIf your eyes were half as bright they still would light my way
If your heart were twice as true then youd be mine today
Thats why I often wish that you were half as lovely twice as true
Im only one of those who thinks of you and sighs
Just another who knows your laughter and lies
I wish that you were someone who was half as lovely twice as true
I love you I love you too much it seems for any fool can see
With your heart so crowded with other dreams how can you dream of me
Though I pray the gods of love will make you care somehow
Still I know the odds of love are all against me now
But I might stand a chance if you were half as lovely twice as true
Maybe if your loveliness were not so heavenly
Maybe then I might possess the only one for me
I wish you ere someone who was half as lovely twice as trueThe likes of you may never be attracted to the likes of me
But accidents will happen and Ill be around
And maybe therell be no one else but me around
Forevermore may never start you may ignore my hopeful heart
And chances are not the one to make you fall
But accidents will happen after all
A smile may show it your eyes may glow
Before you know it Im sure Ill know
So if you fall in just that way oh wouldnt I be thrilled to hear you say
I had a lovely accident today
Your eyes may glow Im sure Ill knowListen big boy
Now that you got me made
Goodness but Im afraid
Somethins gonna happen to you
Listen big boy
You gotta be hooked and how
I would die if I should lose you now

There was magic abroad in the air
There were angels dining at the Ritz
And a nightingale sang in Berkley Square
I may be right I may be wrong
But Im perfectly willing to swear
That when you turned and smiled at me
A nightingale sang in Berkley Square
The moon that lingered over London town
Poor puzzled moon he wore a frown
How could he know we two were so in love
The whole darn world seemed upside down
The streets of town were paved with stars
It was such a romantic affair
And as we kissed and said goodnight
A nightingale sang in Berkley Square
The streets of town were paved with stars
It was such a romantic affair
And as we kissed and said goodnight
A nightingale sang in Berkley Square
I know cause I was there
That night in Berkley SquareAmerica America America America
Oh beautiful for spacious skies for amber waves of grain
For purple moutain majesties above thy fruited plain
America America God shed His grace on thee
And crown thy good with brotherhood from sea to shining sea
Oh beautiful for patriot dream that sees beyond the years
Thine alabaster cities gleam undimmed by human tears
America America God shed His grace on thee
And crown thy good with brotherhood from sea to shining seaThe days of wine and roses laugh and run away like a child at play
Through the meadow land toward a closing door
A door marked nevermore that wasnt there before
The lone-ly night discloses just a passing breeze filled with memories
Of the golden smile that introduced me to
The days of wine and roses and you
The days of wine and roses
more instrumental-rest of the first verse
The lonely - the night discloses just a passing breeze filled with memories
Of the golden smile that introduced me to
The days of wine and roses and youMy heart is sad and lonely
For you I sigh for you dear only
Why havent you seen it
Im all for you body and soul
I spend my days in longing
And wondering why its me youre wronging
I tell you I mean it
Im all for you body and soul
I cant believe it its hard to conceive it
That youd turn away romance
Are you pretending it looks like the ending
Unless I could have one more chance to prove dear
My life a wreck youre making
You know Im yours for just the taking
Id gladly surrender
Myself to you body and soulFly me to the moon
Let me swing among those stars
Let me see what spring is like
On a Jupiter and Mars
In other words hold my hand
In other words baby kiss me
Fill my heart with song
Let me sing for ever more
You are all I long for
All I worship and adore
In other words please be true
In other words I love you
Why dont you fill my heart with song
Let me swing for ever more
Because you are all I long for
All I worship and i adore
In other words please be true
In other words in other words
I I love youToday I may not have a thing at all
Except for just a dream or two
But Ive got lots of plans for tomorrow
And all my tomorrows belong to you
Right now it may not seem like spring at all
Were drifting and the laughs are few
But Ive got rainbows planned for tomorrow
And all my tomorrows belong to you
No one knows better than I
That luck keeps passing me by thats fate
But with you there at my side
Ill soon be turning the tide just wait
As long as Ive got arms that cling at all
Its you that Ill be clinging to
And all the dreams I dream beg or borrow
On some bright tomorrow theyll all come true
And all my bright tomorrows belong to youHave yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
From now on our troubles will be out of sight
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yuletide gay
From now on our troubles will be miles away
Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more
Through the years we all will be together
If the fates allow
So hang a shining star upon the highest bough
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now
Through the years we all will be together
If the fates allow
So hang a shining star upon the highest bough
And have yourself a merry little Christmas nowTall and tan and young and lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes each one she passes
Goes A-a-a-h
When she walks shes like a samba
When she walks shes like a samba
That swings so cool and sways so gentle
That when she passes each one she passes
Goes A-a-a-h
Oh but I watch her so sadly
How can I tell her I love her
Yes I would give my heart gladly
But each day as she walks to the sea
She looks straight ahead not at me
Tall and tan and young and lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes I smile but she
Doesnt see She just doesnt see
No she just doesntYa see a pair of laughing eyes
And suddenly youre sighing sighs
Youre thinkin nothins wrong
You string along boy then SNAP
Those eyes those sighs -
Theyre part of the tender trap
Youre hand in hand beneath the trees
And soon theres music in the breeze
Youre actin kind of smug
Until your heart just goes WHAP
Those trees that breeze -
Theyre part of the tender trap
Some starry night
When her kisses make you tingle
Shell hold you tight
And youll hate yourself for being single
And all at once it seems so nice
The folks are throwin shoes and rice
You hurry to a spot thats just a dot on the map
Youre hooked youre cooked
Youre caught in the tender trap
Musical interlude
Some starry night
When her kisses make you tingle
Shell hold you tight
And youll hate yourself for bein single
And all at once it seems so nice
The folks are throwin shoes and rice
You hurry to a spot thats just a dot on the map
And then you wonder how it all came about
Its too late now theres no gettin out -
You fell in love and love is the tender trapDrinkin again and thinkin of when when you loved me
Im havin a few and wishin that you were here
Makin the rounds accepting a round from strangers
Bein a fool just hopin that youll appear
Sure I can borrow a smoke maybe tell some joker a bad joke
But nobody laughs they dont laugh at a broken heart
Oh yeah Im drinkin again its always the same
That same old story
After the kicks theres little old mixed-up me
Tryin to lose a dream that used to beShe was Boston I was Vegas
She was crepe suzette I was pie
She was lectures I was movies but I loved her
She was Mozart I was Macy
She was afternoon tea I was saloon
She was Junior League I was Dodgers
But I loved her morning night and noon
Opposites attract the wise men claim
Still I wish that we had been a little more the same
It might have been a shoot out war
If we had know each other more
She was polo I was race track
She was museum I was GP
She did her best to change me
Though she never never knew quite how
But I loved her almost as much as I do now
Piano Interlude
She was Wall Street I was pawn shop
She was French champagne I was beer
She knew much more that I did
But there was one thing she didnt know
That I loved her cause I never never told her soI really cant stay
Betty its cold outside
Ive got to go away
Betty its cold out there
This evening has been
Been hoping that youd drop in
So very nice
Ill hold your hands theyre just like ice
My mother will start to worry
Beautiful whats youre hurry
And father will be pacing the floor
Listen to that fireplace roar
So really Id better scurry
Beautiful please dont hurry
Well maybe just a half a drink more
Why dont you put some records on while I pour
And the neighbors might think
Betty its bad out there
Say whats in this drink
No cabs to be had out there
I wish I knew how
Your eyes are like starlight now
To break the spell
Ill take your hat your hair looks swell
I ought to say no no no sir
Mind if I move in closer
At least Im gonna say that I tried
Whats the sense of hurtin my pride
I really cant stay
Baby dont hold out
Ah but its cold outside
I simply must go
Betty its cold outside
The answer is no
I say its cold out there
The welcome has been
How lucky that you dropped in
So nice and warm
Look out that window man thats hard
My sister will be suspicious
Gosh your lips look delicious
My brother will be there at the door
Waves upon a tropical shore
My maiden aunts mind is vicious
Gosh your lips are delicious
Well maybe just a cigarette more
Oh never such a blizzard before
Ive got to go home
Betty youll freeze out there
Say lend me your coat
Its up to your knees out there
Youve really been grand
I thrill when you touch my hand
But dont you see
How can you do this thing to me
Theres bound to be talk tomorrow
Think of my lifelong sorrow
At least there will be plenty implied
If you caught pneumonia and died
I really cant stay
Get over that old lie
Ah but its cold outsideThe clock will tick away the hours
One by one
Then the time will come
When all the waitings done
The time when you return
And find me here and run
If it takes forever
I will wait for you
For a thousand summers
I will wait for you
Till youre here back
Back beside me
Till Im holding you
Till I hear you sigh
Here in my arms
Anywhere you wander
Anywhere you go
Every day remember
How I love you so
In your heart believe
What in my heart I know
That forevermore
Ill wait for youShes a fool and dont I know it
But a fool can have her charms
Im in love and dont I show it
Like a babe in arms
Loves the same old sad sensation
Lately Ive not slept a wink
Since this silly situation
Has me on the blink
Im wild again beguiled again
A simpering whimpering child again
Bewitched bothered and bewildered am I
Couldnt sleep wouldnt sleep
Then love came and told me I shouldnt sleep
Bewitched bothered and bewildered am I
Lost my heart but what of it
She is cold I agree
She might laugh but I love it
Although the laughs on me
Ill sing to her bring spring to her
And long for the day when Ill cling to her
Bewitched bothered and bewildered am IEvery night was long and gloomy shadows gathered in the air
No one ever listened to me no one wondered did I care
None in all the world to love me none to count that stars that hung
Then the moon came out above me and I saw that it was young
I wished on the moon for something I never knew
Wished on the moon for more than I ever knew
A sweeter rose a softer sky
An April day that would not dance away
I begged of a star to throw me a beam or two
Wished on a star and asked for a dream or two
I looked for evry loveliness it all came true
I wished on the moon for youHear that music playing listen to what its saying
Throughout the years Ive made a lot of friends
Many became famous most of them go nameless
But I dedicate this song to all of them
Ive sung with the best and Ive had it all
Ive gone from neighborhood saloons to Carnegie Hall
Ive been down and out and Ive been in demand
But I wouldnt have made it without them heres to the band
Those magical notes those musical pearls
Ive sung with all the Counts the Dukes the Kings and the Earls
And the experience I have to say was grand
But I wouldnt have made it without them heres to the band
Strings soaring horns boring
Drums pounding in my ear
To start at the ground and reach for the top
To have such a wonderful career I just gotta stop
Stop and turn around to thank everyone that sits on the stand
Cause I wouldnt have made it without them heres to the band
Heres to those ladies and the gentlemen
Heres to the AF of MI wouldnt have made it without them heres to the band
Heres to the bandIm doing my Christmas dreaming a little early this year
No sign of snow around
And yet I go around hearing jingle bells ringing in my ear
Your promise must be the reason
The happy season is here
So Im doing my Christmas dreaming a little early this yearAdeste fideles

Throw in undependable too
Do my foolish alibis bore you
Well Im not too clever I just adore you
Call me unpredictable tell me Im impractical
Rainbows Im inclined to pursue
Call me irresponsible yes Im unreliable
But its undeniably true Im irresponsibly mad for youTheyre writing songs of love but not for me
A lucky stars above but not for me
With love to lead the way
Ive found more clouds of gray
Than any Russian play can guarantee
I was a fool to fall and get this way
Ah ho alas and awe so lackaday
Although I cant dismiss
The memory of her kiss
I guess shes not shes not for me
Old man sunshine listen you
Never tell me dreams come true
Just try it and all start a riot
Beatrice Fairfax dont you dare
Ever tell me she will care
Im certain its the final curtain
I never want to here from any cheerful Polly-Annas
Who tell you fate supplies a mate its all bananas
It all began so well but what an end
This is the time a fellow needs a friend
When every happy plot
Ends with a marriage knot
And theres no knot no knot for meDont look so sad I know its over
But life goes on and this old world will keep on a-turnin
Lets just be glad we had some time to spend together
Theres no need to watch the bridges that were burning
Lay your head upon my pillow
Hold your warm and tender body close to mine
Hear the whisper of the raindrops flowing soft against the window
And make believe you love me one more time
For the good times
Ill get along youll find another
And Ill be here if you should find you ever need me
Dont say a word about tomorrow or forever
Therell be time enough for sadness when you leave me
Lay your head upon my pillow
Hold your warm and tender body close to mine
Hear the whisper of the raindrops flowing soft against the window
And make believe you love me one more time
For the good times
For the good times
For the good times
For the good timesalto solo by beverly jenkins chorus
gonna find me a gypsy and get my fortune told
im gonna find me a gypsy and get my fortune told
im gonna say please missus gypsy tell me what the future will hold
hurry your deck of cards and your crystal ball
for there you will see that you will pray for light
the future will almost certainly be whatever you want it to be
but with rockets and picks from music and jetsam
theres no butt that you can push and push
let your imagination burst into flame
and it will let you do whatever you damn well to do dodo
Given a choice I would choose to have a magic wand that I could use
To draw a melody from that enchanted blade of grass
And cheese and wood and wind and sea
I would stand there dig a grave and quietly say
Ladies and gentlemen play for me play for me
and the orchestra plays a beautiful melodyI love the looks of you and the lure of you
The sweet of you and the pure of you
The eyes the arms and the that mouth of you
The east west north and the that south of you
Id love to gain complete control of you
Handle even the heart and soul of you
Love at least a small percent of me do
Cause Because I love all of youI had the craziest dream last night yes I did
I never dreamed it could be
Yet there you were in love with me
I found saw your lips next close to mine so I kissed you them
And you didnt mind it at all
When Im awake such a break never happens
How long can I guy go on dreaming
If theres a chance that you care
Then please say that you do
Say it and make my craziest dream come trueIve got you under my skin
Ive got you deep in the heart of me
So deep in my heart that youre really a part of me
Ive got you under my skin
Id tried so not to give in
I said to myself this affair never will go so well
But why should I try to resist when baby I know down well
Ive got you under my skin
Id sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin you near
In spite of a warnin voice that comes in the night
And repeats repeats in my ear
Dont you know you fool you never can win
Use your mentality wake up to reality
But each time that I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin
Cause Ive got you under my skin
I would sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin you near
In spite of the warning voice that comes in the night
And repeats how it yells in my ear
Dont you know you fool aint no chance to win
Why not use your mentality get up wake up to reality
And each time I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop just before I begin
Cause Ive got you under my skin
And I like you under my skinI walked down these city streets
Just a lonely man inspired
Hoping God would send the water down
To quench this burning fire
If I left here for the mountain
A monastery man
Things are still the same so I remain
To show just who I am
Seen things around me
Bonnie and Clyde
Graffiti with no message
Doctors medicine and pride
But it doesnt really matter
Theyre blowin in the wind
On the cover of a magazine
Chorus
Hallelujah
Babylon is falling
Babylon is falling
Hallelujah
Babylon is falling
Babylon is falling
I try to wash my dirty hands
But they wont come off with water
Hoping truth will make me clean and then
Redeem my sons and daughters
Though theyre not were very happy
Vast along the nose
Thats why I left my memories far behind on natures road
Seems so simple the futures the past
The present are the things we holdin on to make those last
But it doesnt really matter
ChorusPerdido I look for my heart its perdido
I lost it way down in Torido
While chancing a dance fiesta
Bolero he glanced as I danced the Bolero
He said taking off his sombrero Lets meet for a sweet fietsa
High was the sun when we first came close
Low was the moon when we said adios
Perdido since then has my heart been perdido
I know I must go to Torido that yearning to lose perdido
I look for my heart its perdido
I lost it way down in Torido
He glanced as I danced the Bolero
He smiled as he tipped his sombrero
High was the moon when we first came close
Low was the moon when we said adios
Since then has my heart been perdido
I must go to Torido that yearning telude
Perdido oeoeoeoe Perdido oeoeoeoe Perdido
The day the fiesta started
Perdido oeoeoeoe Perdido oeoeoeoe Perdido
Thats when my heart departed
Its perdidoSweet Indian maiden since first I met you
I cant forget you Cherokee sweetheart
Child of the prairie your love keeps calling
My heart enthralling Cherokee
Dreams of summertime of lover time gone by
Throng my memory so tenderly and sigh My
Sweet Indian maiden one day Ill hold you
In my arms fold you CherokeeLullaby of Birdland thats what I
Always hear when you sigh
Never in my wordland
Could there be ways to reveal
In a phrase how I feel
Have you ever heard two turtle doves
Bill and coo when they love
Thats the kind of magic
Music we make with our lips when we kiss
And theres a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
Thats how Id cry in my pillow
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye
Lullaby of Birdland whisper low
Kiss me sweet and well go
Flyin high in Birdland
High in the sky up above
All because were in loveEver since the lucky night I found you
Ive hung around you just like a fool
Falling head and heels in love like a kid out of school
My poor heart is in an awful state now
But its too late now to call a halt
So if I become a nuisance its all your fault
Dont blame me for falling in love with you
Im under your spell but how can I help it
Dont blame me
Cant you see when you do the things you do
If I cant conceal the thrill that Im feeling
Dont blame me
Icant help it if that doggoned moon above
Makes me need someone like you to love
Blame your kiss as sweet as a kiss can be
And blame all your charms that melt in my arms
But dont blame me
I like every single thing about you
Without a doubt you are like a dream
In my mind I find a picture of us as a team
Ever since the hour of our meeting
Ive been repeating a silly phrase
Hoping that youll understand me one of these days
Dont blame me for falling in love with you
Im under your spell but how can I help it
Dont blame me
Cant you see when you do the things you do
If I cant conceal the thrill that Im feeling
Dont blame me
Icant help it if that doggoned moon above
Makes me need someone like you to love
Blame your kiss as sweet as a kiss can be
And blame all your charms that melt in my arms
But dont blame meI never knew the charm of spring
Never met it face to face
I never knew my heart could sing
Never missed a warm embrace till
April in Paris
Chestnuts in blossom
Holiday tables
Under the trees
April in Paris
This is a feeling
That no one can ever reprise
I never knew the charm of spring
I never met it face to face
And I never knew my heart could sing
Never missed a warm embrace tillIts summertime and the living is easy
Fish are jumping and the cotton is high
Your daddys rich and your mamas good-looking
Hush little baby dont you cry
Dont cry dont cry dont cry
No no no no
Dont cry dont cry
One of these mornings youre gonna rise up singing
You spread your wings and take to the sky
But until that morning there is nothing can harm you
With your daddy and mommy standing by
They are standing by I know dont cry
Summertime summertime summertime
and the living is living is easy
Fish are I know the fish are jumping
and cotton is so high
Your daddy is so so rich and your mama good-
She had to be good-looking
So hush little baby dont you cry
Dont you cry no no dont cry
No need to cry dont cry dont cry
Summertime summertimeEast of the sun and west of the moon
Well build a dream house of love dear
Close to the sun in the day
Near to the moon at night
Well live in a lovely way dear
Sharing our love in the pale moonlight
Just you and I
Forever and a day
Love will not die
Well keep it that way
Up among the stars
Well find a harmony of life to a lovely tune
East of the sun and west of the moon dear
East of the sun and west of the moonDancing in the dark Till the tune ends
Were dancing in the dark and it soon ends
Were waltzing in the wonder of why were here
Time hurries by were here and gone
Looking for the light of a new love
To brighten up the night I have you love
And we can face the music together
Dancing in the darkYou know the feeling of something half remembered
Of something that never happened yet you recall it well
You know the feeling of recognizing someone
That youve never met as far as you could tell well
Laura is the face in the misty light
Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The laugh that floats on a summer night
That you can never quite recall
And you see Laura on the train that is passing through
Those eyes how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you
That was Laura but shes only a dreamThis lovely day will lengthen into evening
Well sigh goodbye to all we ever had
Alone where we have walked together
Ill remember April and be glad
Ill be content you loved me once in April
Your lips were warm and love and spring were new
Im not afraid of autumn and her sorrow
For Ill remember April and you
The fire will dwindle into glowing ashes
For flames live such a little while
I wont forget but I wont be lonely
Ill remember April and smileEveryone knows him as Old Folks
Like the seasons hell come and hell go
Just as free as a bird and as good as his word
Thats why everybody loves him so
Always leaving his spoon in his coffee
Tucks his napkin up under his chin
And that yellow cow-pie is so mellow its ripe
But you neednt be ashamed of him
Every Friday hell go fishing down on his favorite lake
But he only hooks a perch or two the whale got away
Looks like we warm the steak
Someday therell be no more Old Folks
What a lonesome old town this will be
Childrens voice at play will be still for a day
The day they take the Old Folks awayIve been around the world in a plane
Settled revolutions in Spain
The North Pole I have charted
But cant get started with you
And at the golf course Im under par
Metro-Goldwyn wants me to star
Ive got a house and a show place
But cant get no place with you
Youre so supreme
The lyrics I write of you
Dream dream day and night of you
Scheme just for the sight of you
Baby but what good dose it do
Ive been consulted by Franklin D
Even Gabel had me to tea
But now Im broken hearted
Cant get started with you
Youre so supreme
The lyrics I write of you
Dream dream day and night of you
Scheme just for the sight of you
But what good does it do
Ive been consulted by Franklin D
Even Basic had me to tea
But now Im broken hearted
Cant get started with youIm cuttin out to see the Apple
Grab my Alto Sax and Im back on the road
Ive practiced everything thats out
No doubt Ill be makin it big
Just giggin with those Cats in New York
Im gonna cut me off some scrapple
Gonna cut that Apple right down to the core
Theyve never heard the Bird before
Im sure Ill be makin it big
Just giggin with those Cats in New York
Blow into town
The joints are really jujmpin
With some cool bopin music
Man its really quite a scene
I cant wait to get out there
And take out my horn and play
Im gonna be hangin with those cats in Harlem
Spendin all day playin bebop
Im cutting Scrapple from the Apple
Goin to cut this Apple right down to the core
Ill put some Scrapple on the floor for sure
Ill be makin it big just giggin with these cats in New YorkI dont know why but Im feeling so sad
I long to try something I never had
Never had no kissin
Oh what Ive been missin
Lover man oh where can you be
The night is cold and Im so alone
Id give my soul just to call you my own
Got a moon above me
But no one to love me
Lover man oh where can you be
Ive heard it said
That the thrill of romance
Can be like a heavenly dream
I go to bed with a prayer
That youll make love to me
Strange as it seems
Someday well meet
And youll dry all my tears
Then whisper sweet
Little things in my ear
Hugging and a-kissing
Oh what Ive been missing
Lover man oh where can you beMy old flame I cant even think of his name but its funny now and then
How my thoughts go flashing back again to my old flame
My old flame my new lovers all seem so tame
For I havent met a gent so magnificent or elegant as my old flame
Ive met so many who had fascinating ways
A fascinating gaze in their eyes some who took me up to the skies
But their attempts at love were only imitations of my old flame
I cant even think of his name but Ill never be the same
Until I discover what became of my old flame
Ive met so many who had fascinating way
A fascinating gaze in their eyes some who took me up to the skies
But their attempts at love were only imitations of my old flame
I cant even think of his name but Ill never be the same
Until I discover what became of my old flameI get up in the evening
And I aint got nothing to say
I come home in the morning
I go to bed feeling the same way
I aint nothing but tired
Man Im just tired and bored with myself
Hey there baby I could use just a little help
You cant start a fire
You cant start a fire without a spark
This guns for hire
Even if were just dancing in the dark
Message keeps getting clearer
Radios on and Im moving round the place
I check my look in the mirror
I wanna change my clothes my hair my face
Man I aint getting nowhere
Im just living in a dump like this
Theres something happening somewhere
Baby I just know that there is
You cant start a fire
You cant start a fire without a spark
This guns for hire
Even if were just dancing in the dark
You sit around getting older
Theres a joke here somewhere and its on me
Ill shake this world off my shoulders
Come on baby this laughs on me
Stay on the streets of this town
And theyll be carving you up alright
They say you gotta stay hungry
Hey baby Im just about starving tonight
Im dying for some action
Im sick of sitting round here trying to write this book
I need a love reaction
Come on now baby gimme just one look
You cant start a fire sitting round crying over a broken heart
This guns for hire
Even if were just dancing in the dark
You cant start a fire worrying about your little world falling apart
This guns for hire
Even if were just dancing in the dark
Even if were just dancing in the dark
Even if were just dancing in the dark
Even if were just dancing in the dark
Hey babyYou are the promised kiss of springtime
That makes the lonely winter seem long
You are the breathless hush of evening
That trembles on the brink of a lovely song
You are the angel glow that lights a star
The dearest things I know are what you are
Some day my happy arms will hold you
And some day Ill know that moment divine
When all the things you are are mine
You are the angel glow that lights a star
The dearest things I know are what you are
Some day my happy arms will hold you
And some day Ill know that moment divine
When all the things you are are mineHow much do I love you
Ill tell you no lie
How deep is the ocean
How high is the sky
How many times a day do I think of you
How many roses are sprinkled with dew
How far would I travel
To be where you are
How far is the journey
From here to a star
And if I ever lost you how much would I cry
How deep is the ocean
How high is the sky
How far would I travel
To be where you are
How far is the journey
From here to a star
And if I ever lost you how much would I cry
How deep is the ocean
How high is the sky
How high is the skyThey say that Bird was really quite a genius
The way he played the saxophone was unknown
Was truly ahead of his time
Played with a passion that was totally true
Stated in a fashion that was totally new
A master of the rhythm and blues
He would stay our every night and hed play
He made bop into a language today
Bird really put his soul into his music
Every note that Parker blew was so true
You knew he was talking to you
Now everybody wants to study bird
Play everything he wrote and spread the word
This music really has to be heard
Study Ornithology you will hear the quality of BopDozens of girls would storm up
I had to lock my door
Somehow I couldnt warm up
To one before
What was it that controlled me
What kept my love life lean
My intuition told me
Youd come on the scene
Lady listen to the rhythm of my heartbeat
And youll get just what I mean
Embrace me my sweet embraceable you
Embrace me you irreplaceable you
Just one look at you my heart grew tipsy in me
You and you alone bring out the gypsy in me
I love all the many charms about you
Above all I want my arms about
Dont be a naughty baby
Come to papa come to papa do
My sweet embraceable youone
You know hes gotta get away
To the merry-go-round and round
Count the times that he laid awake at night thinkin
Am I goin down now
Am I goin down
Am I goin down now oh
two
Its not easy puttin on a smile
Youre alone lost and found
She waits at home just to love him through the night thinkin
Hes been gone so long now
Is he comin home
Hes been gone so long now oh
Chorus
Merry-go-round and round repeat
one
She waits alone
Just to love him through the night
Im coming home babeWhy dont you come over bout a quarter to nine
Bring all of your famly and I will bring mine
If I should bring my brothers and you bring the others
Then I can sing a song like Jeru just for you
Just for all the lovely people that you see in the road
Well sing them a song in Jeruvian mode
If I can have a prefrence Ill even make refrence
To why you write a song like Jeru just for you
Then if youd be kind enough to tell me why you
write these extended bridges
can it be romance that always
haunts me in my reverie
So why not come on over bout a quarter to eight
If you can come early Ill never be late
And now youre all invited I hope youre delighted
To sing a little song like Jeru just for you
just for me too
Gather around tale to be told
Maybe its new maybe its old listen my friend
Blowin away doin alright
Plain all day workin all night listen again
Movin along coverin ground
Singin the song lovin the sound listen and then
blow together birds of a feather
Out playin the blues and I Got Rhythm
All at once a moment came without a warning
Got so hot we had to cool it
Go for glory tell you the story
Out payin our dues until we found we were
assisting at an unexpected borning
twas the birth of the Cool
So now I can tell you why Im always
Trying to tell you listen come with me
New York and were together in my reverie
So why dont you come over bout a quarter to two
Forget all the others just me and just you
And while were versifying
Wed better start trying
To write another song just for me
Just for you one more JeruMy heart is sad and lonely
For you I sigh for you dear only
Why havent you seen it
Im all for you body and soul
I spend my days in longing
And wondering why its me youre wronging
I tell you I mean it
Im all for you body and soul
I cant believe it
Its hard to conceive it
That youd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending
Unless I could have just one more chance to prove dear
My life a wreck youre making
You know Im yours for just the taking
Id gladly surrender myself to you body and soulThis isnt sometimes this is always
This isnt maybe this is always
This is love
The real beginning of forever
This isnt just mid summer madness
A passing glow a moments gladness
Yes its love
I knew it on the night we met
You tied a string around my heart
So how can I forget you
With every kiss I know that
This is always
Yes its love
I knew it on the night we met
You tied a string around my heart
So how can I forget you
With every kiss I know that
This is alwaysThis isnt sometimes this is always
This isnt maybe this is always
This is love
The real beginning of forever
This isnt just mid summer madness
A passing glow a moments gladness
Yes its love
I knew it on the night we met
You tied a string around my heart
So how can I forget you
With every kiss I know that
This is always
Yes its love
I knew it on the night we met
You tied a string around my heart
So how can I forget you
With every kiss I know that
This is alwaysYou go to my head
And you linger like a haunting refrain
And I find you spinning round in my brain
Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne
You go to my head
Like a sip of sparkling burgundy brew
And I find the very mention of you
Like the kicker in a julep or two
The thrill of the thought
That you might give a thought to my plea cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Cant you see that it never can be
You go to my head
With a smile that makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand Julys
You intoxicate my soul with your eyesEmbrace me my sweet embraceable you
Embrace me you irreplaceable you
Just one look at you
My heart grew tipsy in me
You and you alone
Bring out the gypsy in me
I love all the many charms about you
Above all I want my arms about you
Dont be a naughty baby
Come to papa come to papa do
My sweet embraceable youI was a hum-drum person
Leading a life apart
When love flew in through my window wide
And quickened my hum-drum heart
Love flew in thorough my window
I was so happy then
But after love had stayed a little while
Love flew out again
What is this thing called love
This funny thing called love
Just who can solve its mystery
Why should it make a fool of me
I saw you there one wonderful day
You took my heart and threw my heart away
Thats why I ask the Lawd up in Heaven above
What is this thing called love
You gave me days of sunshine
You gave me nights of cheer
You made my life an enchanted dream
Til somebody else came near
Somebody else came near you
I felt the winters chill
And now I sit and wonder night and day
Why I love you stillYoure mean to me
Why must you be mean to me
Gee honey it seems to me
You love to see me cryin
I dont know why
I stay home each night
When you say you phone
You dont and Im left alone
Sing the blues and sighin
You treat me coldly each day in the year
You always scold me
Whenever somebody is near dear
I must be great fun to be mean to me
You shouldnt for cant you see
What you mean to meGOT TO GET BACK
GOT TO GET BACK
GET TO THE PLACE I BELONG
ITS BEFORE
FOR TOO LONG
YOU KNOW A TRAGESTY
THE WAY
WITHOUT YOU
WITHOUT
CAN YOU DO THAT
AND SO
ASKING YOU THAT
PLEASE
TELL ME THAT YOU LOVE ITStar eyes
That to me is what your eyes are
Soft as stars in April skies are
Tell me some day youll fulfill
Their promise of a thrill
Star eyes
Flashing eyes in which my hopes rise
Let me show you where my heart lies
Let me prove that it adores
That loveliness of yours
All my life Ive felt
Content to stargaze at the skies
Now I only want to to melt
The stardust in your eyes
Star eyes
When if ever will my lips know
If its me for whom those eyes glow
Makes no diffrence where you are
Your eyes still hold my wishing star
Oh star eyes how lovely you areEveryone knows him as Old Folks
Like the seasons hell come and hell go
Just as free as a bird and as good as his word
Thats why everybody loves him so
Always leaving his spoon in his coffee

Someday therell be no more Old Folks
What a lonesome old town this will be
Childrens voice at play will be still for a day
The day they take the Old Folks awayI dont want to lose you this good thing that I got cause if I do
I will surely surely lose a lot
Cause your love is better than any love I know
Its like thunder and lightning
The way you love me is frightening
You better knock knock on wood baby I better knock
Im not superstitious about ya but I cant take no chance
I got me spinning baby you know Im in a trance
Cause your love is better than any love I know
Its like thunder and lightning
The way you love me is frightening
You better knock knock on wood baby I better knock
Its no secret about it that woman is my loving cup
Cause she sees to it that I get enough
Just one touch from here you know it means so much
Its like thunder and lightning
The way you love me is frightening
You better knock knock knock on wood baby I better knock
Think I better knock knock knock on wood
Think I better knock knock knock on wood All my life I had to struggle I paid some heavy dues
Squeekin out a livin playin easy blues
Then one day my music made me a millionaire
I bought a big old mansion with central heated air
Now I got more money than I know how to use
Got everything a man could want but I aint got no blues
Success for me could only lead to my immediate doom
cause I cant play the blues in an airconditioned room
Now I was doin better with a smaller piece of pie
But all my fame and fortune I cant identify
I lost the inspiration that came natural in the start
I have to have a mean old woman just to break my heart
Now my lifes too easy Id be getting soft
I used to play the blues all day but now I just play golf
Now all my pain is rearranged my life is changes too
cause I cant play the blues in an airconditioned room
You know what Im saying
Its kinda hard to play the blues
if you dont have any problems
You might think Im crazy you might think Im strange
The first thing in the morning Im gonna make a change
I throw away my money I move back to that shag
Do whatever I gotta do to get that old feelin back
I know Id be feelin better with nothing left to lose
When times are bad the less I had the better I played the blues
I buy myself some turkey and wine and howl it at the moon
cause I cant play the blues in an airconditioned roomOpen up the sky
Cause Im coming up to you
So send down your wings
And let em bring me to you

Upon a ranch he rested as he went along his way
When all at once a mighty herd of red eyed cows he saw
A plowin through the ragged sky and up the cloudy draw
Yippee-I-Yay
Yippee-I-Yo
Ghost Riders in the Sky
Their brands were still on fire and their hoofs were made of steel
Their horns were black and shiney and their hot breath he could feel
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky
Yippee-I-Yay
Yippee-I-Yo
Ghost Riders in the Sky
Their faces gone their eyes were blurred their shirts all soaked with sweat
Their rindin hard to catch that heard but they aint caught em yet
Cause they got to ride forever in that range up in the sky
On horses snortin fire as they ride they hear their cry
Yippee-I-Yay
Yippee-I-Yo
Ghost Riders in the Sky
As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name
If you want to save your soul from hell youre ridin on that range
Then cowboy change your ways todayor with us youll ride on
Tryin to catch the devils herd across the endless sky
Yippee-I-Yay Yippee-I-Yay
Yippee-I-Yo Yippee-I-Yo
Ghost Riders in the SkyEarly in the morning bout the break of day

Viva Las Vegas Viva Las Vegas
How I wish that there were more

She had a dream about the King of Sweden
He gave her things that she was needin
He gave her a home built of gold and steel
A diamond car with the platinum wheels
He gave her is townhouse and his racin horses
Each meal she ate was a dozen courses
Had a million dollars worth of nickels and dimes
She sat around and counted them a million times

To the United States of America
And indeed we have congregated here at this time
To celebrate a most treasured wellspring of contemporary music
It is the sound which historians in the far future might catalog
Under twentieth century pre-light-emitting-diode euphoric
But today the sound lives and tonight is sampled exclusively
For your entertainment pleasure
From the music capitals of this continent
This is the hard hitting show band of Joliet Jake and Elwood Blues

To the United States of America

To celebrate a most treasured wellspring of contemporary music
It is the sound which historians in the far future might catalog
Under twentieth century pre-light-emitting-diode euphoric
But today the sound lives and tonight is sampled exclusively
For your entertainment pleasure
From the music capitals of this continent
