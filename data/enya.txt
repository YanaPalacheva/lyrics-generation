Wild Violet
The poignancy of things
A purple flower
The blossom of springs
and the light snow of winter
How they fall
The beauty of nature
A green leaf and
Autumn colors
The voice of the wind
The song of birds
A sad sea
A joyful sea
Mountains
Pebbles
A wild irisOut of the night has come the day
Out of the night our small earth
Our words drift away
Our words journey
To find those who will listen
We call into the distance Repeat 
Less than a pearl in the sea of stars
We are a lost island in the shadows
It may be our words become lost
It may be our words find nothing find no-one
We call into the distance Repeat Every time the rain comes down
I close my eyes and listen
I can hear the lonesome sound
Of the sky as it cries
Listen to the rain
Here it comes again
Hear it in the rain
Feel the touch of tears that fall
They wont fall forever
In the way the day will flow
All things come all things go
Listen to the rain the rain
Here it comes again again
Hear it in the rain the rain
Late at night I drift away
I can hear you calling
And my name is in the rain
Leaves on trees whispering
Deep blue seas mysteries
Even when this moment ends
Cant let go this feeling
Everything will come again
In the sound falling down
Of the sky as it cries
Hear my name in the rainIt may be the stars fallen from above
And you know love is with you when you rise
For night and day belong to love
City lights shine on the harbour
Night has fallen down
Through the darkness
And the shadow
I will still go on
Long long journey
Through the darkness
Long long way to go
But what are miles
Across the ocean
To the heart thats coming home
Where the road
Runs through the valley
Where the river flows
I will follow every highway
To the place I know
Long long journey
Through the darkness
Long long way to go
But what are miles
Across the ocean
To the heart thats coming home
Long long journey
Out of nowhere
Long long way to go
But what are sighs
And what is sadness
To the heart thats coming home
repeatWhere are you this moment
Only in my dreams
Youre missing but youre always
A heartbeat from me
Im lost now without you
I dont know where you are
I keep watching I keep hoping
But time keeps us apart
Is there a way I can find you
Is there a sign I should know
Is there a road I could follow
To bring you back home
Winter lies before me
Now youre so far away
In the darkness of my dreaming
The light of you will stay
If I could be close beside you
If I could be where you are
If I could reach out and touch you
And bring you back home
Is there a way I can find you
Is there a sign I should know
Is there a road I can follow
To bring you back home to meHow I remember sleepless nights
When we would read by candlelight
And on the windowpane outside
A new world made of snow
A million feathers falling down
A million stars that touch the ground
So many secrets to be found
Amid the falling snow
Maybe I am falling down
Tell me should I touch the ground
Maybe I wont make a sound
In the darkness all around
The silence of a winters night
Brings memories I hold inside
Remembering a blue moonlight
Upon the fallen snow
Maybe I am falling down
Tell me should I touch the ground
Maybe I wont make a sound
In the darkness all around
I close my window to the night
I leave the sky her tears of white
And all is lit by candlelight
Amid the falling snow
And all is lit by candlelight
Amid the falling snowIts only now when words are said
That break my heart in two
I wonder how you can endure
All Ive said all I say to you
How strong how brave how true of you
To bear the hurt I gave
I know it tears your heart in two
All Ive said all I say to you
After all the words are said
After all the dreams we made
Every one a precious one
Every one a summer sun
A moment lost forever gone
Can never be again
So know how much it means to me
All you said
All you gave
All your love to meSummer When the day is over
Theres a heart a little colder
Someone said goodbye
But you dont know why
Somewhere there is someone keeping
All the tears they have been weeping
Someone said goodbye
But you dont know why
Is there a reason
Why a broken heart begins to cry
Is there a reason
You were lost although you dont know why
Give me a reason
Why you never want to say goodbye
If theres a reason
I dont know why
Always looking for meaning
All the time you keep believing
But I dont know why
You wont say goodbye
Even when the sun is shining
You dont see the silver lining
But you dont know why
You wont say goodbye
Is there a reason
Why a broken dream can never fly
Is there a reason
You believe and you close your eyes
Give me a reason
Why you hide away so much inside
If theres a reason
I dont know why
Is there a reason
Why a broken heart begins to cry
Is there a reason
You were lost although you dont know why
Give me a reason
Why you never want to say goodbye
If theres a reason
I dont know why RepeatOur words go beyond the moon
Our words go into the shadows
The river sings the endlessness
We write of our journey through night
We write in our aloneness
We want to know the shape of eternity
Who knows the way it is
Who knows what time will not tell us
Mountains solitude and the moon
Until the journeys end
The river holds the lost road of the sky
The shape of eternity
Who knows the way it is
Who knows what time will not tell us
Where is the beginning
Where is the end
Why did we fall into days
Why are we calling out into the endlessness
Who knows the way it is
Who knows what time will not tell usFrom the City of Constellations
To the wanderer
And a Place of Rains
He journeys on
The City of hesitation and doubt
The Island if the house the color of the sea
The Plain of Mementoes
He journeys on to find his love
Th Valley of lost time
The City of End and Endlessness
The Isle of Revenents
He journeys on
The City of Solitudes
The City of distance from you
The City of Words of blue
And yellow and red and green
He journeys on to find his love
Where the road takes him through
The City of Sleep
The thinking that does not end in within him
Then he dreams
The road takes him
This man who is searching
It brings him
In silence through the night
Where the Cities that do not Exist exist
It brings him
In silence through the night
Close to the City of Realizations
It is here one finds the way
Mount Orison
The City of Days
The Tree of the lost
He journeys on
North of his love
A road through a valley of darkness
The islands that are not of this world
He journeys on to find his love
It is a long way through darkness
To the way of the eremite
To the eremite sings of the world and of
The journey of love which is not lost in eternity

Water shows the hidden heart

All the stars were fallen embers
Once when night seemed forever
I was with you
Once in the care of morning
In the air was all belonging
Once when that day was dawning
I was with you
How far we are from morning
How far we are
And the stars shining through the darkness
Falling in the air
Once as the night was leaving
Into us our dreams were weaving
Once all dreams were worth keeping
I was with youLazy old day
Rolling away
Dreaming the day away
Dont want to go
Now that Im in the flow
Crazy amazing day
One red balloon
Floats to the moon
Just let it fly away
I only know
That Im longing to go
Back to my lazy day
And how it sings and how it sighs
And how it never stays
And how it rings and how it cries
And how it sails away away awayDan y dwr tawelwch sydd

It weaves a web over mystery
All ravelled threads can rend apart
For hope has a place in the lovers heart
Hope has a place in a lovers heart
Whispering world a sigh of sighs
The ebb and the flow of the ocean tides
One breath one word may end or may start
A hope in a place of the lovers heart
Hope has a place in a lovers heart
Look to love you may dream
And if it should leave then give it wings
But if such a love is meant to be
Hope is home and the heart is free
Under the heavens we journey far
On roads of life were the wanderers
So let love rise so let love depart
Let hope have a place in the lovers heart
Hope has a place in a lovers heartI walk the maze of moments
But everywhere I turn to
Begins a new beginning
But never finds a finish
I walk to the horizon
And there I find another
It all seems so surprising
And then I find that I know
You go there youre gone forever
I go there Ill lose my way
If we stay here were not together
Anywhere is
The moon upon the ocean
Is swept around in motion
But without ever knowing
The reason for its flowing
In motion on the ocean
The moon still keeps on moving
The waves still keep on waving
And I still keep on going
You go there youre gone forever
I go there Ill lose my way
If we stay here were not together
Anywhere is
I wonder if the stars sign
The life that is to be mine
And would they let their light shine
Enough for me to follow
I look up to the heavens
But night has clouded over
No spark of constellation
No Vela no Orion
The shells upon the warm sands
Have taken from their own lands
The echo of their story
But all I hear are low sounds
As pillow words are weaving
And willow waves are leaving
But should I be believing
That I am only dreaming
You go there youre gone forever
I go there Ill lose my way
If we stay here were not together
Anywhere is
To leave the tread of all time
And let it make a dark line
In hopes that I can still find
The way back to the moment
I took the turn and turned to
Begin a new beginning
Still looking for the answer
I cannot find the finish
Its either this or that way
Its one way or the other
It should be one direction
It could be on reflection
The turn I have just taken
The turn that I was making
I might be just beginning
I might be near the endHere am I
Yet another goodbye
He says AdiÃÂ³s says AdiÃÂ³s

Your face before me
Though I dont know why
Thoughts disappearing like tears from the Moon
Waiting here as I sit by the stone
They came before me
Those men from the Sun
Signs from the heavens say I am the one
Now youre here I can see your light
This light that I must follow
You you may take my life away so far away
Now I know I must leave your spell
I want tomorrow
Now youre here I can see your light
This light that I must follow
You you may take my life away so far away
Now I know I must leave your spell
I want tomorrowI have been given
One moment from heaven
As I am walking
Surrounded by night
Stars high above me
Make a wish under moonlight
On my way home
I remember
Only good days
On my way home
I remember all the best days
Im on my way home
I can remember
Every new day
I move in silence
With each step taken
Snow falling round me
Like angels in flight
Far in the distance
Is my wish under moonlight
On my way home
I remember
Only good days
On my way home
I remember all the best days
Im on my way home
I can remember
Every new daySuddenly before my eyes
Hues of indigo arise
With them how my spirit sighs
Paint the sky with stars
Only night will ever know
Why the heavens never show
All the dreams there are to know
Paint the sky with stars
Who has placed the midnight sky
So a spirit has to fly
As the heavens seem so far now
Who will paint the midnight star
Night has brought to those who sleep
Only dreams they cannot keep
I have legends in the deep
Paint the sky with stars
Who has placed the midnight sky
So a spirit has to fly
As the heavens seem so far now
Who will paint the midnight star
Place a name upon the night
One to set your heart alight
And to make the darkness bright
Paint the sky with starsI dreamt I dwelt in marble halls
With vassals and serfs at my side
And of all who assembled within those walls
That I was the hope and the pride
I had riches all too great to count
And a high ancestral name
But I also dreamt which pleased me most
That you loved me still the same
That you loved me
You loved me still the same
That you loved me
You loved me still the same
I dreamt that suitors sought my hand
That knights upon bended knee
And with vows no maidens heart could withstand
They pledged their faith to me
And I dreamt that one of that noble host
Came forth my hand to claim
But I also dreamt which charmed me most
That you loved me still the same
That you loved me
You loved me still the same
That you loved me
You loved me still the sameI walk the maze of moments
But everywhere I turn to
Begins a new beginning
But never finds a finish
I walk to the horizon
And there I find another
It all seems so surprising
And then I find that I know

You go there youre gone forever

Are you near if rain should fall
Am I to believe
You will rise to calm the storm
For so great a treasure words will never do
Surely if this is
Promises are mine to give you
Mine to give
Here all too soon the day
Wish the moon to fall and alter tomorrow
I should know
Heaven has her way
Each one given memories to own
Angels all could be
Should you move both earth and sea
Angels I could feel
All those dark clouds disappearing
Even as I breathe
Comes an angel to their keep
Surely if this is
Promises are mine to give you
Mine to giveEurus

They say the sky high above
Is Caribbean blue
If every man says all he can
If every man is true
Do I believe the sky above

In December mornings
Cold is the cry that rings
From this far distant shore
Winter has come too late
Too close beside me
How can I chase away
All these fears deep inside
Ill wait the signs to come
Ill find a way
I will wait the time to come
Ill find a way home
My light shall be the moon
And my path - the ocean
My guide the morning star
As I sail home to you
Ill wait the signs to come
Ill find a way
I will wait the time to come
Ill find a way home
My light shall be the moon
And my path - the ocean
My guide the morning star
As I sail home to you
Who then can warm my soul
Who can quell my passion
Out of these dreams - a boat
I will sail home to youI have been given
One moment from heaven
As I am walking
Surrounded by night
Stars high above me
Make a wish under moonlight
On my way home
I remember
Only good days
On my way home
I remember all the best days
Im on my way home
I can remember
Every new day
I move in silence
With each step taken
Snow falling round me
Like angels in flight
Far in the distance
Is my wish under moonlight
On my way home
I remember
Only good days
On my way home
I remember all the best days
Im on my way home
I can remember

Hi-ri-U-O
Marbh go deoWho can tell me if we have heaven
Who can say the way it should be
Moonlight holly the Sappho Comet
Angels tears below a tree
You talk of the break of morning
As you view the new aurora
Cloud in crimson the key of heaven
One love carved in acajou
One told me of China Roses
One a thousand nights and one night
Earths last picture the end of evening
Hue of indigo and blue
A new moon leads me to
Woods of dreams and I follow
A new world waits for me
My dream my way
I know that if I have heaven
There is nothing to desire
Rain and river a world of wonder
May be paradise to me
I see the sun
I see the starsStrange how my heart beats
To find myself upon your shore
Strange how I still feel
My loss of comfort gone before
Cool waves wash over
And drift away with dreams of youth
So time is stolen
I cannot hold you long enough
And so this is where I should be now
Days and nights falling by
Days and nights falling by me
I know of a dream I should be holding
Days and nights falling by
Days and nights falling by me
Cool waves wash over
And drift away with reams of youth
So time is stolen
I cannot hold you long enough
Soft blue horizons
Reach far into my childhood days
As you are rising
To bring me my forgotten ways
Strange how I falter
To find Im standing in deep water
Strange how my heart beats
To find Im standing on your shoreEnglish
Listen to my heart
Sorrowful alas
I am lost without you
And your wife
The great love in your life
She guided me
Be with me always
Day and night
Chorus
Lamenting the great loneliness
The sorrowful tears
Asleep one in the quiet green grave
In a deep peace
There was happiness
But that departed
It was he who followed you
Your husband
The great love in your life
He guided me
Be with me always
Day and night

On the road you chose
To find out why the winds die
And where the stories go
All days come from one day
That much you must know
You cannot change whats over
But only where you go
One way leads to diamonds
One way leads to gold
Another leads you only
To everything youre told
In your heart you wonder
Which of these is true
The road that leads to nowhere
The road that leads to you
Will you find the answer
In all you say and do
Will you find the answer
In you
Each heart is a pilgrim
Each one wants to know

Above earths lamentations
I hear the real though far-off hymn
That hails a new creation
Through all the tumult and the strife
I hear its music ringing
It sounds an echo in my soul
How can I keep from singing
While though the tempest loudly roars
I hear the truth it liveth
And though the darkness round me close
Songs in the night it giveth
No storm can shake my inmost calm
While to that rock Im clinging
Since love is lord of heaven and earth
How can I keep from singing
When tyrants tremble in their fear
And hear their death knell ringing
When friends rejoice both far and near
How can I keep from singing
In prison cell and dungeon vile
Our thoughts to them are winging
When friends by shame are undefiled
How can I keep from singingMaidin is ts an lae

Pilgrim how you journey
On the road you chose
To find out where the winds die
And where the stories go
All days come from one day
That must you must know
You cannot change whats over
But only where you go
One way leads to diamonds
One way leads to gold
Another leads you only
To everything youre told
In your heart you wonder
Which of these is true
The road that leads to nowhere
The road that leads to you
Will you find the answer
In all you say and do
Will you find the answer
In you
Each heart is a pilgrim
Each one wants to know
The reason why the winds die
And where the stories go

Yo el otoÃo

He sido todo soy yo
Yo el verano
Yo el Ãbano
Soy la soÃadoraDawn breaks there is blue in the sky
Your face before me
Though I dont know why
Thoughts disappearing like tears from the Moon
Waiting here as I sit by the stone
They came before me
Those men from the Sun
Signs from the heavens say I am the one
Now youre here I can see your light
This light that I must follow
You you may take my life away so far away
Now I know I must leave your spell
I want tomorrow
Now youre here I can see your light
This light that I must follow
You you may take my life away so far away
Now I know I must leave your spell
I want tomorrowWhen the evening falls
And the daylight is fading
From within me calls
Could it be I am sleeping
For a moment I stray
Then it holds me completely
Close to home - I cannot say
Close to home feeling so far away
As I walk the room there before me a shadow
From another world where no other can follow
Carry me to my own to where I can cross over
Close to home - I cannot say
Close to home feeling so far away
Forever searching never right
I am lost in oceans of night
Forever hoping I can find memories
Those memories I left behind
Even though I leave will I go on believing
That this time is real - am I lost in this feeling
Like a child passing through
Never knowing the reason
I am home - I know the way
I am home - feeling oh so far awayWhen the warmth of the day becomes the night
Who could sleep beneath a strange moonlight
No guiding star
So far from home
Walked the way o promise to find but snow
Throughout the voice of the winds brings nothing more
Than low echoes
So far from home
Even from a child
A wish is not enough
For me for me the sky may fall
And even from a child
A dream is not enough
Could be could be the sky may fall
Could be could be the night ends all
No rains could weep as I have wept
To know a simple dream will not be kept
I am a child
So far from homeI walk the maze of moments
but everywhere I turn to
begins a new beginning
but never finds a finish
I walk to the horizon
and there I find another
it all seems so surprising
and then I find that I know
You go there youre gone forever
I go there Ill lose my way
if we stay here were not together
Anywhere is
The moon upon the ocean
is swept around in motion
but without ever knowing
the reason for its flowing
in motion on the ocean
the moon still keeps on moving
the waves still keep on waving
and I still keep on going
You go there youre gone forever
I go there Ill lose my way
if we stay here were not together
Anywhere is
I wonder if the stars sign
the life that is to be mine
and would they let their light shine
enough for me to follow
I look up to the heavens
but night has clouded over
no spark of constellation
no Vela no Orion
The shells upon the warm sands
have taken from their own lands
the echo of their story
but all I hear are low sounds
as pillow words are weaving
and willow waves are leaving
but should I be believing
that I am only dreaming
You go there youre gone forever
I go there Ill lose my way
if we stay here were not together
Anywhere is
To leave the thread of all time
and let it make a dark line
in hopes that I can still find
the way back to the moment
I took the turn and turned to
begin a new beginning
still looking for the answer
I cannot find the finish
its either this or that way
its one way or the other
it should be one direction
it could be on reflection
the turn I have just taken
the turn that I was making
I might be just beginning
I might be near the endOne day one night one moment
My dreams could be tomorrow
One step one fall one falter
East or west
Over earth or by ocean
One way to be my journey
This way could be my
Book of days
No day no night no moment
Can hold me back from trying
Ill flag Ill fall Ill falter
Ill find my day maybe
Far and away
Far and away
One day one night one moment
With a dream to be living
One step one fall one falter

Look above them
Only they can see
Where the clouds are going
Only to discover
Dust and sunlight
Ever make the sky so blue
Afternoon is hazy
River flowing
All around the sounds
Moving closer to them
Telling them the story
Told by Flora
Dreams they never knew
Silver willows
Tears from Persia
Those who come
From a far-off island
Winter Chanterelle lies
Under cover
Glory-of-the-sun in blue
Some they know as passion
Some as freedom
Some they know as love
And the way it leaves them
Summer snowflake
For a season

Everywhere is whispering
The sound of summer
The diamonds on the water
Are falling from the sun
The diamonds on the water

You held me high you held me high
And all those years you guided me
So I could find my way
How long your love had sheltered me
You held me high you held me high
A harbour holding back the sea
So I could find my way
So let me give this dream to you
Upon another shore
So let me give this dream to you
Each night and ever more
Yet only time keeps us apart
You held me high you held me high
Youre in the shadows of my heart
So I can find my way
You held me high you held me high
So let me give this dream to you
Upon another shore
So let me give this dream to you
Each night and ever more
A thousand dreams you gave to me
You held me high you held me high

Dont hide away in solitude

Let tears become a soft rain
Why do you hide the loss inside
The love you feel is in your eyes
Why do you go upon this road
When you could find your way homeA silver hue on wings of blue
As all around me shadows dance in light
Sun is high above
And winds are still enough
And all I want to do is stay
And everywhere the blues
Are moving in the air
I see them in their flight
Sun is high above
And winds are still enough
And all I want to do is stay
For seven days
They make the sky
Look down upon them
As they go their way
Sun is high above
And winds are still enough
And all I want to do is stay
For seven nights
They wait the moment
For the morning light to come again
Sun is high above
And winds are still enough
And all I want to do is stay
And one by one
They wander one by one
Meander never go astray
Sun is high above
And winds are still enough
And all I want to do is stay
And so I stand and gaze
And so I watch the maze of blues depart the day
Sun is high above
And winds are still enough
And one by one they fly away
Sun is high above
And winds are still enough
And one by one they fly away
Sun is high above
And winds are still enough
And one by one they fly awaySancta Maria

I turn around
To find you walk away
And even when I whisper
The winds will come
To steal the words I say
I could fall and keep on falling
I could call and keep on calling
Wonder why this love is over
Wonder why its not forever
Even in the silence
I hear my heart
Its still a part of you
And even in the morning
When light has come
I dont know what to do
So high so low I could fall and keep on falling
I could call and keep on calling
Wonder why this love is over
Wonder why its not forever
So high so low I could fall and keep on falling

Wonder why its not foreverLost in the mountains
far from the crowds
we wold wander together
walking for miles
with the night still before us
and day passing by
I always remeber your smile
Cool in the evening
warm in the sun
the clouds moving slowly
time was undone
yet the days fell before us
and the nights rolled on by
I always remember your smile
Every step and each moment
were all so worthwhile
I always remember your smile
I always remember your smile
And its strange how for a moment
the heavens were mine
I always remember your smile
Each one has a journey
thats how it goes
sometimes were together
sometimes aloneAh ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
Wait for the sun
Watching the sky
Black as a crow
Night passes by
Taking the stars
So far away
Everything flows
Here comes another new day
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
Into the wind
I throw the night
Silver and gold
Turn into light
Im on the road
I know the way
Everything flows
Here comes another new day

There is wisdom waiting to be found
That first place of night
Was an island in the color of stars
Spring
Green grew and the flowers blossomed
A lost time far in the distance
Summer
The sun and the sand
Autumn
The shape of yellow leaves falling
A lost time far in the distance
Winter
The sky sang snow
Written into the night
A world of stars
A lost time far in the distance
Now is the season of water
The island the cities the darkness
Through time this became our world
But our quest is not yet over
Now is the season of the moon
Soft breezes whispering
Night and day
But our quest is not yet overAnd all the light will be will be
And all the future prophecy
And all the waves the sea the sea
And on the road are you and me

And all the winds are like a kiss
And all the years are nemesis
And all the moments fall in mist
And all is dust remember this

And all the light will be will be
And all the waves the sea
And all the waves the sea the sea

And all the nights and all the days
And all the heavens go their way
And only change is here to stay

And all the light will be will be
And all the waves the sea

Now I walk alone
Youre no longer here
The days turn to years
I could never say goodbye
To the sadness in my eyes
You know you are in my heart
But the miles keep us apart
Time moves slow
In the falling rain
I still dream of you
And whisper your name
Will I see you once again
I could never say goodbye
To the sadness in my eyes
You know you are in my heart
But the miles keep us apartMemories we share together
Moments no one else can know
I will keep them close to me
Never let them go
Once you filled my hands with roses
Then you gave your heart to me
When a kiss had followed this
Love was meant to be
Time goes by and the snow is drifting
Slowly in the sky cold cold night
As you lie beside me I can hear your heartbeat
You have lost yourself in dreaming
I have lost myself in you
Now we lie beneath the sky
Stars and midnight blue
Stars and midnight blueSomewhere
In a winter night
The angels
Begin their flight
Dark skies
With miles to go
No footsteps
To be lost in snow
They fly to you
Oh newborn king
They fly to you
Oh angels sing
One is sorrow
One is peace
One will come
To give you sleep
One is comfort
One is grief
One will take
The tears you weep
New star
In a midnight sky
In heaven
All the angels fly
Soft wings so true
And all things
They will give to you
Somewhere
In a winter night
The angels
Begin their flight
Tonight
All sing

An apple falls on his head

Could be tomorrow but then

It fills the night with kisses
Have you seen the bright blue star
It fills your heart with wishes
Have you seen the candlelight
It shines from every window
Have you seen the moon above
It lights the sky in silver
Green is in the mistletoe
And red is in the holly
Silver in the stars above
That shine on everybody
Gold is in the candlelight
And crimson in the embers
White is in the winter night
That everyone remembers
Have you heard the boys outside
When all the girls are skating
Have you heard their sweet hearts cry
For all this time theyre waiting
Green is in the mistletoe
And red is in the holly
Silver in the stars above
That shine on everybody
Gold is in the candlelight
And crimson in the embers
White is in the winter night
That everyone remembers
Have you seen the children playing
Tiny hands are frozen
Have you seen them hurry home
When suddenly its snowing
Green is in the mistletoe
And red is in the holly
Silver in the stars above
That shine on everybody
Gold is in the candlelight
And crimson in the embers
White is in the winter night
That everyone remembers
Have you heard that bells are ringing
Ringing out their story
Have you heard the choir singing
Glory glory gloryCome see high above
Come see high in the heavens
A new star shining bright
Out of the darkness comes a light
Come here in a child
Come here bells that are ringing
And for some distant shore
Sounds of a journey echo on
This is the night
They say
Everyone wants a dream
This is the night
They say
Nothing is as it seems
Come see close your eyes
Come see give me your sorrow
And I keep watch for you
Until the dawn is breaking through
Until the morning wakens you
Come dream through the night
Come dream and then tomorrow
Theyll see who what will know
Dreams are more precious than gold
Dreams are more precious than gold
Dreams are more precious than goldOne toy soldier stands alone
With his drum down by his side
One toy soldier on his own
With his drum to keep the time
He keeps the beet of marching feet
He keeps the beat so true
Hes one small toy for one small boy
But his heart is oh so blue
Who can mend my broken drum
Will it be as good as new
I must play when morning comes
If I dont what shall I do
He keeps the beat of marching feet
He keeps the beat inside
While children sleep he dreams so deep
Theres a secret he must hide
For he keeps the beat of marching feet
He keeps the beat so true
He wants to sing and hopes to bring
Happy Christmas day to you
He keeps the beat of marching feet
He keeps the beat inside
Someone has come to mend his drum
Now his heart lights up with pride
So he keeps the beat of marching feet
He keeps the beat so true
When morning comes he plays his drum
Happy Christmas Day to you
Happy Christmas Day to you
Happy Christmas Day to you
Happy Christmas Day to youCity streets passing by
Underneath stormy skies
Neon signs in the night
Red and blue city lights
Cargo trains rolling by

Trains across the plains
And in the sky a star alone
Every time its the same

Everywhere empty roads
Where they go no one knows

Was shining
In moonlight
And everywhere around us
The silence
Of midnight
And we had gathered snowflakes
Remember
The soft light
Of starlight on snow
Oooh remember this
For no one knows
The way love goes
Oooh remember this
For no one knows
The way life goes
We walked the road together
One last time
By moonlight
As underneath the heavens
The slow chimes
At midnight
But nothing is forever
Not even
The starlight
At midnight
Not even
The moonlight
Oooh remember this
For no one knows
The way love goes
Oooh remember this
