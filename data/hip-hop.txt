Today I read the paper and it said tru life caught a case
They said they found the victim with a knife stuck in his face

So you can back and shake it on the field and show them whats up

You niggas better follow the instructions

Everybody cant do it the way I do it

Till the sun come out
A nigga playin playin
We make the guns come out
Now my question is
Who they gonna blame
When Im back number one on the Billboard again
Shit shift now the game done change
Since Mike made Thriller and Prince made Purple Rain
I guess I make the kids wanna slang
And NWA made the West Coast bang
Nah its just music man its just music
Now get your ass on the dance floor and move it

Let me see you put your hands up in the air
I said get up
Girl you look good
I want to get to know you better
You look good in them jeans
And them red stilettos
You got a Bentley
Coupe booty baby
I want to drive
See I tell you what mileage is
When Im inside
Ima take you for a spin
You know round and round
Switch gears till your love come down
I take you to the point of no return
If you listen you learn
Just how a nigga earn
I got money to burn
While the Gap Band play
She dropped the bomb on me
Its up and down
And up and down
Gracefully
Rick James would have said she a brick house
Or Fifty you should go home to see

Its the return of the heartless creative monster
Eminem dre fifty
Shady aftermath - Play this on the radio
Niggas cant tell me nothing son
I was broke fucked up now what I dare u say something
I break your fucking neck anyone of these niggas son
Im waiting
And Im on ur heels Mr carter
I heard u
U want me to die ugly Ok
Dont end up on the list be a missing person like camrom ja joe who want some
Who want it What upI can hear your heartbeat youre scared yeah yeah
I can hear your heartbeat youre scared
I can hear your heartbeat youre scared yeah yeah
I can hear your heartbeat youre scared
You see Im a psycho a sicko Im crazy
I said I got my knife pulled Ill kill you if you make me
They wanna see me shot up locked up and cage me
Ill come back bigger stronger and angry
Look look Ive come from a different crew
You fuck with me Ill get to you
A clip or two Ill put through you
Cause I aint got shit to do
Pistol poppin a pussy drop
Drama never ever stop
Eenie meenie miney moe
Now tre pound or forty-four
Pick a strap the Tec the Mac
The hawk Ill stab it in your back
Ill blow your brains I know your name
And where you rest Ill make a mess
The hollow tips hit ya chest
Call for blood to E-M-S
Come pick you up
You know you fucked when
You get on a stretcher
Cause Ill come in to ICU
To see you off to heaven
The system I done been through it
Theres nothing new to me
They locked me up they let me out
You seen this in the movies
The criminals be criminals
Why they up in corrections
They come home get a nine
Nigga commit trying perfection
Its murder when they found the gun now they doing ballistic
But they cant find a fingerprint the shits going terrific
Get so close to your target that its really hard to miss it
You see Im a psycho a sicko Im crazy
I said I got my knife pulled Ill kill you if you make me
They wanna see me shot up locked up and cage me
Ill come back bigger stronger and angry
Man these are average raps Im keeping the savage batch hidden
The can of whoop ass with the ShadyAftermath lid
You pop off the top its like opening vats of acid
Beat the Octomom to death with a Cabbage Patch Kid
Attack a snatch yeah theres something to jack a batch in
Impregnated then shoot up the embryo sack with Mac-tens
Triplets quadruplets and a couple of back-to-back twins
Dead fetuses falling out all over Jack is back again
The Rippers at your service girl I can see that youre nervous
But I barely scratched the surface like my last batch of girlfriends
That I buried in my fucking backyard still trying to dig their way out
I foam like an attack dog how late you wanna stay out
Its past your curfew when its dark Im searching for you in the park
Shady murdered him another virgin he just hit his mark
He met his quota for the month they found Dakota all rolled up
Inside a bag he probably dragged the body for about a block
Disappeared without a trace no DNA no not a drop
Cause me and Dre and fifty we will never get caught by the cops
CSI they hate us but they gotta give a lot of props
The drama pops grab the butcher knife from off the counter tops
You see Im a psycho a sicko Im crazy
I said I got my knife pulled Ill kill you if you make me
They wanna see me shot up locked up and cage me
Ill come back bigger stronger and angry
Im as ill as can be
My appeal is to serial killers what a pill is to me
Killing so villainously
Still as maniacal on the NyQuil and psycho as Michael Myers
You know what were like on the motherfucking mic so try us
And youre gonna find out what the fuck were like with pliers
Its operation time they got him hooked up to wires
Squeezing he bleeding wheezing breathing he half dead
He must aint know but now he know how Shady the Math is
Even murderous tactics get better with practice
Lead showers gun powder feel the talons burn burn
School of arts Julliard you better learn learn
Chris Reeves in his grave yeah homie turn turn
Im debating mutilating the lady
Youve been waiting for Shady and Fif aint no duplicating it baby
Theres a baby in the dryer theres a torso in the washer
I think it might even belong to Portia when I tossed her
Arms and legs in the garbage cause the rest of her I lost her
Her head is in the disposal with Jessicas I squashed her
I put her on the ringer and hung her over the wash tub
When Im through with Ricky itll be blood that hell cough up
The hard rock Ill soft up get caught up and get washed up
In Detroit or Norfolk witness this shit end up nauseous
Look deep in my eye see many many men die
I swing gem stars faster than a Samurai
You see Im a psycho a sicko Im crazy
I said I got my knife pulled Ill kill you if you make me
They wanna see me shot up locked up and cage me
Ill come back bigger stronger and angryI gave her books to read fed her mind with knowledge
Gave her street smarts shit you cant get in college
Shes a reflection of me so you know she the shit
If Im a star she a star if Im rich she rich
Thats my dog
I tell her stay she wanna go I tell her go she wanna stay
Thats my dog
You know a bitch dont usually mean nothing to me thats right
But thats my dog I go left she go right I go up she go down
She couldnt listen that she aint around
So ungrateful screaming I hate you
She must got amnesia bitch I made you
Now just think just think that couldve been you
Just think that shouldve been you
Yeah with me I share the world with you
But you aint ride with a rider so I aint fucking with you
Say say say girl come here no you no her yeah you go

And now girl you lose cause I aint fucking with ya

Shopping sprees drop top hair blowing in the wind

Living lavish instead its your girlfriend
But you tripping while we sipping
In the back of the club big tipping
She say it hurts when you supposed to win then you lose
You were supposed to be sure baby you was confused

House cars kids and a pet name for you
Pussycat told you Id make it you aint believe

Dont think Im crazy cause I dont fear man
Cause I fear when I kill a man God wont understand
I got a head full of evil thoughts am I Satan
I been couldve killed these niggas Im still waitin
In the telly with two whores Benz with two doors
thirty-two karats in the cross no flaws
You see me in the hood I got at least two guns
I carry the Glock Tony carry my M-one
Hold me down nigga OGs tryin to rock me
Ds waiting for my response to lock me
This is my hustle nigga dont knock me
You need some shit with a banana clip to try and stop me

My attitude is gangsta so I stand some beef
You wanna get acquainted with me you wanna know me
From three point range with a Glock I shoot better then Kobe
See a nigga standing next to me he probably my Co-D
See a bitch getting in my whip she probably gon blow me
See the flow is like a thirty-eight its special yall
Country boy tell ya Im finna blow
Im more like a pimp than a trick you know
See Im in this for the paper but I dont love the hoes
Niggas broke in the hood worried about mines
Grown ass men wearing starter piece shines
You know them little pieces with the little stones
Got little clientele fiends call your cell phones
When the gossip starts Im always the topic
You too old for that shit dawg wont you stop it
Shorty I been watching you watching me

I need you to care for me and
I need you to want me to win
I need to know where Im heading cause I know where Ive been
The flow is bone crushing its nothing I come up with something
Come through your strip fronting stunting
Its something you want seven hundred and forty-five chrome spinners
Haters hate that Im winning
Man Ive been hot from the beginning
Motherfuckers envy the kid control your jealousy
Cause I cant control my temper Im finna catch a felony
Pistol in hand homie Im down to get it popping
Once I squeeze the first shot you know I aint stopping
Till my clip is empty Im simply
Not that nigga you should try your luck with or fuck with
Hollow-tip shells struck you with your bones broken guns smoking still locing
What nigga lay your ass down paramedics get you up feeling
Right now Im on the edge so dont push me
I aim straight for your head so dont push me
Fill your ass up with leadso dont push me
I got something for your ass keep thinking Im pussy
Right now Im on the edge so dont push me
I aim straight for your head so dont push me
Fill your ass up with leadso dont push me
I got something for your ass keep thinking Im pussy
I done lost my bigger nigga and I didnt cry
To young to understand the consequences of a man
Living a lie I gotta get that money
Ill be damned if Im bummy
Gotta watch my back around these niggas cause they funny
twenty years of watching my mamas tears got my heated heavily weeded
Smoking that bong cause I need it
These niggas dont want me balling they want me buried
Bogged in the dirt from shots flurried
Laying with bugs under my shirt
I got plans to hop up in that Hummer
Cause Im a stunner I sit back and wonder
When them angels gonna call my number under
My chest is a heart of a lion
I aint lying bounty hunters got me flying
With my iron high as a giant
Im running from nothing my stomach is touching what Im clutching
To give you more than a concussion end of discussion
My blood is colder so Im bolder
Hennessy and soda hood on my shoulder
Look in the mirror I see a soldier
Right now Im on the edge so dont push me
I aim straight for your head so dont push me
Fill your ass up with leadso dont push me
I got something for your ass keep thinking Im pussy
Right now Im on the edge so dont push me
I aim straight for your head so dont push me
Fill your ass up with leadso dont push me
I got something for your ass keep thinking Im pussy
These are my ideas this is my sweat and tears
This is shit that I saw with my eyeballs my ears
This is me whos gotta be what you see on TV
What you hear on CD what appears easy
Man these teenie boppers see me on these magazine covers
In these beanies and these rags living fantasies
Fronting like its all fun and games til the shoot em up bang
And you see your brains hang and you see we aint playing
Aint saying we aint laying down at night and aint praying
I bullied my way in this game man Im done playing
Man Im done saying that Im done playing
Imma start laying into these motherfucking cocksuckers
Theres no way Im back down like a god damn coward
I cant how would I look as a man bowing to his knees
Like the mad cow disease let somebody lash out at me
And not lash back out at em please
Oh whoa yo ho hold up oh no not me not Marshall
You wanna see Marshall Ill show you Marshall
I try to show you art but you just pick it apart
So I see I have to start showing you fucking old farts
A whole other side I wanted to not show you
So you know youre not dealing with some fucking marshmallow
Little soft yellow punk pussy whose hearts Jello cause
Right now Im on the edge so dont push me
I aim straight for your head so dont push me
Fill your ass up with leadso dont push me
I got something for your ass keep thinking Im pussy
Right now Im on the edge so dont push me
I aim straight for your head so dont push me
Fill your ass up with leadso dont push me
I got something for your ass keep thinking Im pussy

Could I count on you to be there to support me mentally
If I went back to a hoopty from a Benz would you poof and disappear like
Some of my friends
If I was hit and I was hurt would you be by my side
If it was time to put in work would you be down to ride
Id get out and peel a nigga cap and chill and drive
Im asking questions to find out how you feel inside
If I aint rap cause I flipped burgers at Burger King
Would you be ashamed to tell your friends you feelin me

If I was with some other chick and someone happened to see

Man if I get a shot I could make it to the top damn what if
If I got on some pretty boy s like Puffy
Nz in the hood man they just wouldnt love me
If I wore a suit every day like Jay-Z
Nz would think I blew up my fin head and went crazy
If I put diamonds in my teeth like Baby
I wouldnt stand a chance of tryin to sell like Shady
If I put out bulls joints like AZ
Every chance nz get theyd try and play me
But I move around with a little three hundred and eighty
A n try to stunt a n get sprayed be
If I smoked weed all day like Snoop do
Id see the world different through my dilated pupils
If I bust dance moves on you like Usher
Nz did say fifty that aint gangsta f ya

Man I watched the sun go up but come down sayin what if
Man I watched the tide roll in and roll out sayin what if
Homey I play the block tryin to get my packs off sayin what if
Man if I get a shot I could make it to the top damn what if
What if I had blockbuster flicks like Will Smith
And all the backpack nz loved me like Mos Def
Id probably be a cool a n like Ice Cube
Picture me in this flick right now lookin so cool
What if I was a low key n just laid back
Hustle to keep a homey round somebody to hold the gat
Man what if Halle Berry was my next baby moms
S Id give that child support up with no problems
If I caught a case and jumped bail Id get caught
Cause Im that n everybody know from New York
But if I was the new rap n you didnt know
Youd be sayin Damn that kid got a sick flow
What if I just cruised through your hood on twenty-twos
Bumpin Curtis May field or Marvin somethin smooth
And if I let the top down on the Azure
Yeah thatd make you sick to your stomach Im sure ha ha
Man I watched the sun go up but come down sayin what if
Man I watched the tide roll in and roll out sayin what if
Homey I play the block tryin to get my packs off sayin what if
Man if I get a shot I could make it to the top damn what ifYeah ladies and gentlemen

Ask a fan about me they say fifty we love em

My papa never bothered to show me what it was to be a man
Hed just pop another bottle and smoke up a half a gram
I would hop in my Impala and ride all through the night
That gave my homeboy light so when you do it do it right
My fingernails still filled with cocaine residue
I still got the heart to go and bust me a head or two
No other solution you think we hollerin and hootin
Until you wake up and then you got ta hear bout these shootings
I take a pull from Incomprehensible when he put the clip in my pocket
Before I take another bullet Im gonna pull it and pop it
And if its beef my nigga then let your guns do your talkin
The graveyard has got plenty room for a coffin
They say that we responsible for boostin the crime rate
They say that we the reason that these young niggas buyin weight
But Im gonna keep this glock on my waist til my dayin days

Aint it amazing how crazy the hood done made me
Feels like my emotions are froze I stay GD up
Its the things I done seen and shit I been through

Lloyd Banks you know
Cause a nigga thuggin dont mean he dont
Dont wanna see you smile baby
I wanna be the reason you smile
I wanna be the reason you smile
I wanna be the reason you smile
After you wipe away your tears and dry your eyes
Im gettin the feelin you wanna take revenge
From the conversations we have and the way it ends
You wanna discuss me in front of your lady friends
Thats why its just me and my Mercedes Benz
It all depends maybe if we make amends
We can start from scratch
Learn to control your temper and remarks in fact
We plan to be platonic with our hearts in tact
So every time we separate somebodys marchin back
Youre amazing in the sack eyes slanted like youre Asian
But youre black God bless whoever gave you alla that
If you seen her from the back youd understand why dis feel like that
And aint a flaw to her toes the Lord knows
Her pussy good enough to miss award shows
And I aint gotta say nothin she just knows
By the way I look at her to take off all her clothes up and down
Whenever Im not around and you feelin down
Let the thought of me be
I wanna be the reason you smile
I dont wanna see you frown like them kids watch a clown
I wanna bring you joy and be
I wanna be the reason you smile
Baby you know my style you know how I get down
I provide by any means to be
I wanna be the reason you smile
We done been through ups and downs had drama for a while
Im just happy Im around to be
I wanna be the reason you smile
The main reason I been lookin at you pitiful
What about the half of this shit I done did to you
Violated and tiptoed into a crib or two
Ive come clean to be a bigger individual
Even though youre busy boo the evenings when I visit you
Kinda makes me feel lucky cause I see niggaz
When you tease em with your physical
She wanna rack up her brooms I aint got no more room left
Wild drama section eight princess
My foreign chick bad but she been stressed
Cause its hard to communicate
Cause she dont speak-a no English
I been around the world from state to state
But now Im back bustin in your bathroom
Got you laughin in your shower cap
Lets get it on
Cause Im leavin in a hour fly-through
Dont matter shes mad even when I holla back
All I really need your attention for a while
And I bet you I can make you smile
Whenever Im not around and you feelin down
Let the thought of me be
I wanna be the reason you smile
I dont wanna see you frown like them kids watch a clown
I wanna bring you joy and be
I wanna be the reason you smile
Baby you know my style you know how I get down
I provide by any means to be
I wanna be the reason you smile
We done been through ups and downs had drama for a while
Im just happy Im around to be
I wanna be the reason you smile
Whenever Im not around and you feelin down
Let the thought of me be

Back up chump you know Biggie Smalls grips it quick
And kicks it quick you know how black niggas get
With the hoods fatigues with the boots with trees
Smokin weed flippin kis makin crazy Gs
Hittin buckshots at niggas that open spots
On the avenue take my loot and Im baggin you
Pimpin hoes that drive Volvos and Rodeos
Flash the Roll make her wet in her pantyhose
Damn a nigga style is unorthodox
Grip the glock when I walk down the crowded blocks
Just in case a nigga wanna act out

Thats a real nigga for ya
We the realest nigga
fifty Cent and BIG my nigga
Dont try to act like you dont feel a nigga
Biggie yo nigga fifty yo nigga
Squeeze the trigga leave a nigga fa sho
When we smoke spliffs we pack four-fifths
Just in case dread wanna riff
He get a free lift to the cemetary rough very
Not your ordinary we watch you get buried
Thats a real nigga for ya
Get mad do a quarter flip the script and rip your lawyer
Spit at the DA cause fuck what she say
She dont give a fuck about your ass anyway
Up North found first stop for the town
of fist-skill where the hand skills are real ill
Youll be a super Hoover doo-doo stain remover
Ha hahhh yo G pass the ruler
Chorus
When I was young my MO was to go hail the Henny
And even my PO she called me the Ginger Bread Man
I cut ya new case and tell her ass catch me if you can
Dont let your people feel your awkward

Real BIG style watch the kid break it down
Check it thou shalt not fuck wit North C Papa
fifty Cent Ill break yo punk ass off propa
Theres new place like home New York - New York
I run this city I dont dance around like Diddy
Niggas is giddy till they act smack silly
Or spray wit the Mack Milly they dont want drama really
Pushy niggas get hard lip syncing my lyrics like Milly Vanilly
Even the hood they feel me gun cocked hah Im on fire
Niggas out in Philly they feel me they bump my shit
Even bootlegged you know bump my shit bitchIntro
Yeah Ha Ha
Chorus
Man everywhere I go I mean like everywhere I be
I hear niggaz runnin they mouth you should hear how they talk bout me
I know Boo Boo I mean fifty he a grimey nigga
fifty shot my brother Im a find that nigga
We dont see his punk ass unless he on TV
Yeah he did my brother dirty but he dont wanna see me
Member Rydell from KP thought he was his man
Put him on the table to bag up he beat him for grams
How you think he got that money for that Chalk Gray Land
That nigga robbin and stealin everything that he can
Chorus
Man everywhere I go I mean like everywhere I be
I hear hoes runnin they mouth you should hear how they talk bout me
Yeah I know Curtis he used to fuck with my friend
Used to come through my projects pick her up in the Benz
Niggaz from my buildin always used to ask about him
Like she in and out of town right that niggaz get down right
I used to say all I know is the nigga get money
And you standin in my way excuse me dummy
Ronda she told me that nigga a freak
And McDonalds aint the only thing that he eat
Chorus
Man everywhere I go I mean like everywhere I be
I hear everybody runnin they mouth you should hear how they talk bout me
I love fifty Cent thats my dad
But even my mom talk about him bad
She says since he blew up he changed for sure
Hes really fascinated with these fancy hoes
I dont know why but there personalities collide
And my dad will swallow blood before he swallows his pride
You know the kids in my class they be sayin hes crazy
They just like him cause he rollin with Dr Dre and Shady
Chorus
Man everywhere I go I mean like everywhere I be
I hear niggaz runnin they mouth you should hear how they talk bout me
Man fifty fucked up I mean real fucked up
He left us in the hood we fucked up
Still actin like he in the street tellin niggaz they cant eat
You know this motherfucker went and bought Tysons crib
Got Bentleys Ferraris and all that shit
He dont even come through to try and help niggaz out
Thats the bullshit see what Im talkin about
Chorus
Man everywhere I go I mean like everywhere I be
I hear everybody runnin they mouth you should hear how they talk bout me
Thats my Grand baby I love him I raised that boy right
He ran to me cryin sent him back out to fight
Put a battery in his sock go pick up a rock
You aint a chump you want your Grandma to think you a punk
Look at my first Grand baby he is a big rap star
Bought me a house diamonds and a brand new car
I tought him what it takes to go this far
Boy Im the reason you are what you are
Chorus
Man everywhere I go I mean like everywhere I be
I hear everybody runnin they mouth you should hear how they talk bout me
Man everywhere I go I mean like everywhere I be
I hear everybody runnin they mouth you should hear how they talk bout meDont even look at me wrong when I come through the hood
Aint nothin changed still holla at my homies
And when I hit the block I still will kill
And I dont want nigga but I will
If I got to kill
If niggas get to fuckin around if niggas get to fuckin around
Respect come from admiration and fear
You can admire me or you can catch one in ya wig
You see the Testarosa the toasters right on my lap
So if a nigga get out of line a nigga get clapped
I got an arsenal a infantry Im built for this mentally
Thats why Im the general I do what they pretend to do
Front on me now nigga Ill be the end of you
Forget ya enemies and think of what ya friendsll do
I drop a bag off then let a mag off
The Heckler Kochll tear half of ya ass off
Im not for the games Im not for all the playin
The hollow tips rain when I unleash the pain
Get the message from the lions or get the message from the nine
Paint a picture wit words you can see when I shine
Put my back on the wall nigga watch me go for mine
I let twenty-one shots off at the same time yeah
Dont even look at me wrong when I come through the hood
Aint nothin changed still holla at my homies
And when I hit the block I still will kill
And I dont want nigga but I will
If I got to kill
If niggas get to fuckin around if niggas get to fuckin around
Where Im from death is always in the air homie
Nanna love me so you know she say my prayers for me
I come creepin through in the hood wearin Teflon
Hit the corners motherfuckers get left on
Niggas know if not they better check my background
Try and stick me I fill ya back wit mac rounds
Ask Preme nigga fifty dont back down
I keep it funky like fiends in a crack house
Cross the line boy Imma air ya ass out
Screw ya face at me I wan know what thats bout
Nigga I know you aint mad I done came up
And if you are fuck you cause I aint change up
The OGs wanna talk but I dont know these niggas
And I aint did no business wit em I dont owe these niggas
A minute of my time I get it cause I grind
All across the world like the globes mine yeah
Dont even look at me wrong when I come through the hood
Aint nothin changed still holla at my homies
And when I hit the block I still will kill
And I dont want nigga but I will
If I got to kill
If niggas get to fuckin around if niggas get to fuckin around
Konvict
Now tell me have you ever looked up at an instance
And seen a mac aimin atcha head mayne
Before you know it life is flashin reminiscin
And ya body is drippin and full of lead man
I done been there I done cocked that
It aint never been a question Im bout that
Dont go there youll get cocked at
And if ya plan to fuck around then reroute that
Youll never catch me ridin around on these streets
Without a couple metal pieces under my feet
Fully automatic weapons and loaded wit dumb-ds
Stashed up under the carpet like a can of Sea breeze
fifty dont make me ride on these niggas
Cause I will kill dip and hide on these niggas
fifty dont make me ride on these niggas
Cause Ill be long gone like the Ripper so
Dont even look at me wrong when I come through the hood
Aint nothin changed still holla at my homies
And when I hit the block I still will kill
And I dont want nigga but I will
If I got to kill
If niggas get to fuckin around if niggas get to fuckin aroundSomething special unforgettable

She was pregnant by me once glad she didnt have it
Cause I be paying child support now god damn it
Tish was my bitch til she fucked my god brother
I was heated when I heard wanted to go upside his head
It was Christmas I just bought the bitch a sheepskin kid
I was sick to my stomach nigga this is real shit
I aint the sensitive type I aint sit around crying
I caught the bitch on the avenue and punched her in the eye
Call it puppy love Curtis and Janelle in the tree
K-I-S-S-I-N-G
Ds came locked my ass up like a savage
Then came Doobie in the baby carriage
Imagine how it felt summer day pretty blue skies
I gazed mesmerized at her in with green eyes
Im so into you baby we dont even got touch
That the type shit I say when I really want to fuck
Cause her cousin Tisha lived by baby forty
Sold crack before rap so everybody know me
Chase Jus down cut his head the motherfucker owe me
Vicks spinning Cheeks was the hottest rapper in the hood
I aint hate but on the low I didnt think he was good
We wore Timberland boots carhartt suits
You can tell a nigga paid when his Filas shoes suede
Ock a ceaser or a fade kept a pistol or a blade
Try to flip a sixty two like every couple days
I get knocked I come home its all a part of the game
Catch a snitch cut a snitch or put one in his frame
Its like every other summer I was back and forth to jail
Telling nanna Im copping out so I dont need bail
Just the convesary put the money orders in the mail
Call it puppy love curtis and Deawn in the tree
K-I-s-s-I-n-g
Call it puppy love
Call it puppy love
She came to see me on the alley wrote me letters all the time
And I responded to the letters so she stayed on my mind
Told myself Ima grind
As soon as I get out that paper what Im about
After four months home I had the Lan I shine
Two months later I copped the Benz my nine
Stay all cocked even when it hot TAZ out
TNT on the block make yourself get knocked

I sit and think of things to say that may make you smile
Or give you gifts from my heart to reflect my style
Or slang I use when we build may change how you talk
And if Im focused while Im strokin I could change how you walk
Theres a swagger that you calm but when you come from New York

Separate me from the rest I feel like Im the best
If theres a price to pay for feelin you I pay that twice

With two hoes in the whip looking like flipThe business is entertainment
And what entertain the customers is the sight of blood
Cam I mean I was bein nice to him okay Ill get him
You should worship the ground I walk on

Attempted get a year on probation
Cam are you clear what you facin
You must aint hear me I done told you Im a boss
Im eatin good but I aint chubby like Ricky Ross
Word on the street is that fiftys not Jay
And Cam better stay out of his way
Everythings cooler than a fan till you rolled on
Have you in the ICU tryin to hold on
in the waitin room been waitin so long
Till they hear the flat line the doc say hes gone hes gone
Thats up
When they say hes gone
He dead
Well he knew that could happen with the kid
This is graveyard music right here ya dig
This is not competition this is
Career endin mind bendin Southside ya finished
Now look laughin at Cam down on Lennox
They heard what he did but they dont know why he did it
I have eighty of them boys with black flags
Come through with black
And have you zipped up in black bags
For a second he was hot now he cold
I apply pressure on until they fold
But never mind me man thats just how I be
The game got me trained they call me the hustle man
And like fame my style will live forever
They thought I crossover cause they dont know no better
I think they think Im laxed now cause I got the cheddar
Till I return back trust me its nothin
Everythings cooler than a fan till you rolled on
Have you in the ICU tryin to hold on
in the waitin room been waitin so long
Till they hear the flat line the doc say hes gone hes gone
When they say hes gone
It shouldnt have to be like this man
Dipset Cam stay up Im not gonna destroy Dipset
Just gotta make changes from now on Jimmys the boss of Dipset
And Juelz is the capo hes gone
Cams demoted to soldier we like Jimmy better anyway
Ballin come on man

And I dont want nigga but I will
If I got to kill

Respect come from admiration and fear
You can admire me if you can catch one in your wig
You see the Testarossa the toasters right on my lap
So if a nigga get out of line a nigga get clapped
I got an arsenal a infantry Im built for this mentally
Thats why Im the general I do what they pretend to do
Front on me now nigga Ill be the end of you
Forget ya enemies and think of whatcha friendsll do
I drop a bag off then let a mag off
The Heckler Kochll tear half of your ass off
Im not for the games Im not for all the playin
The hollow tips rain when I unleash the pain
Get the message from the lions or get the message from the nine
Paint a picture wit words you can see when I shine
Put my back on the wall nigga watch me go for mine
I let twenty-one shots off at the same time yeah
Oh dont even look at me wrong
When I come through the hood
Aint nothin changed still holla at my homies
Oh and when I hit the block I still will kill
And I dont want nigga but I will
If I got to kill
If niggas get to fuckin around

Where Im from death is always in the air homie
Nanna love me so you know she say my prayers for me
I come creepin through the hood wearin Teflon
Hit the corners motherfuckers get left on
Niggas know if not they better check my background
Try and stick me I fill ya back wit mac rounds

Cross the line boy Imma air your ass out

When I come through the hood

Now tell me have you ever looked up at an instance
And seen a mac aimin atcha head mayne
Before you know what life is flashin and reminiscin
Your body is drippin and full of lead mayne
I done been there I done cocked that
It aint never been a question Im bout that
Dont go there you can cock that
And if you plan to fuck around then reroute that
Youll never catch me ridin around on these streets
Without a couple metal pieces under my feet
Fully automatic weapons and loaded wit dumb-ds
Stashed up under the carpet like a can of Seabreeze
fifty dont make me ride on these niggas
Cause I will kill dip and hide on these niggas
fifty dont make me ride on these niggas
Cause Ill be long gone like the Ripper
So dont even look at me wrong

Oh and when I hit the block I still will kill
And I dont want nigga but I will

Spend her life savings in a day cause she likes me
Commitment for me

Confusion occurs coming up in the cold world
Daddy aint around probably out committing felonies
My favorite rapper used to sing Check check out My Melody
I wanna live good so shit I sell dope
For a four finger ring one of them gold ropes
Nana told me if I passed Id get a sheepskin coat
If I can move a few packs Id get the hat now thatd be dope
Tossed and turned in my sleep that night
Woke up the next mornin niggas had stole my bike
Different day same shit aint nothing good in the hood
Id run away from this bitch and never come back if I could
Hate it or love it the underdogs on top

Ill fo-five em kill a nigga on my song
And really do it thats the true meaning of a ghostwriter
Ten Gs ll take your daughter out of Air Forces
Believe you me homey I know all about losses
Im from Compton wear the wrong colors be cautious
One phone callll have your body dumped in Marcy
I stay strapped like car seats been banging
Since my lil nigga Rob got killed for his Barkleys
Thats ten years I told Pooh in ninety-five
Ill kill you if you try me for my Air Max ninety-fives
Told Banks when I met him Imma ride
And if I gotta die Id rather homicide
I aint have fifty cent when my grandmama died
Now Im going back to Cali with my Jacob on

From the beginning to the end losers lose
Winners win this is real we aint got to pretend
The cold world that we in is full of pressure and pain
Enough of me nigga now listen to Game
Used to see Five-O throw the crack by the bench
Now Im fuckin with five-zero its all starting to make sense
My moms happy she aint gotta pay the rent
And she got a red bow on that brand new Benz
Waiting on Sha Money to land sitting in the Range
Thinking how they spent thirty million dollars on airplanes
When theres kids starving
Pac is gone and Brenda still throwing babies in the garbage
I wanna know Whats Going On like I hear Marvin
No schoolbooks they used that wood to build coffins
Whenever Im in the booth and I get exhausted
I think what if Marie Baker got that abortion
I love you ma

It is what it is man
Sirens flashin you know the routine the crime scene taped off
It started out a robbery they blew half his face off
They seen him shinin course full of diamonds he bought
Grindin his foot slipped off the ladder of success he was climbin
The Ds came through asked the niggas if they knew what happened
Somehow my name end up in anything that involves clappin
Detectives at my mama crib they say they wanna question me
They put me in a line up last time and they arrested me
When it come to cookin coke they know I got the recipe
I turn a quarter to a half thats why they mess with me
Im the neighborhood pusher I move packs to make stacks
A little weed a little X a little H a little crack
Figure I push it to the limit take this shit to the max
Navy blue vest on navy blue Yankee hat
Calm in my palm fully loaded fire arm
First to let off last to run every time its on
I tell niggas to suck my dick
Get the fuck out my face cause I dont need em
Cause theyre never around when Im down
Shot and Im bleedin
What niggas yeah

Sayin they gonna do me somethin now you know thats a lie
Nigga you look at me wrong Ill let that hammer fly
Im rich I still wake up with crime on my mind
Queens nigga put it down like Pappy Mason in his prime
When I say move nigga move or get caught in the cross fire
Up a fence runnin cut my fuckin hand on a barb wire
Shits crazy just a different day its the same shit
Hollow tip part in ya head leave ya whole fuckin brain split
They sit they see me in the Ashton Martin
Whats the matter they cant get that hoopty started
Thought they was grindin well goddamn where that money at
Thought you was fucked cause you was lettin paper stack
You aint a hustler matter of fact yous a busta

It aint my fault you cant break it down the way I break it down
Listen you can call me what you want black and ugly
But you cant convince me the Lord dont love me
When my cds drop they sell the best
You call it luck why cant it just be Im blessed
Im a trackstar runnin through life chasin my dream
I may even trade in a mic in for a triple beam
I zone off thinkin is there really heaven or hell
So what happens to a changed man who dies in a cell
I need no answers to these questions cause time will tell
Got a date with destiny shes more than a girl
Dont much good come from me but my music
Is a gift given from God so Ima use it Yeah
Chorus
I just reach for style Im hot I breaks it down
It aint my fault you cant break it down the way I break it down
Some days Im in the crowd all by myself
Bunch of niggas around Im still by myself
Im drink off in the crowd by myself
Thinkin bout nothin more than life what else
These days its hard to tell who really cares for me
So you when hear this song you should say a prayer for me
I put a message in my music hope it brightens your day
If times are hard when you hear it know youll be okay
A OG told me Gods favorites have a hard time
You out the hood thats good now stay on the grind

Lights on or lights off she like it from behind
So seductive you should see the way she whine
Her hips in slow mo on the floor when we grind

Run the light then pop at Jake trust me son niggas will go hard for that cake
These thirsty niggas will lurk then youll have to catch em and murk em

Chorus
That house party off the hook until the shots go off
Well thats what you get for stuntin on my block show off
You shit out of luck if niggas catch you slippin

In the mornin roll over and we can start over
Chorus
fifty Cent
Yeah I called just to say hope you havin a nice day
Youre special I get into you oops I mean Im into you
Every chance I get I find time to spend with you
Jet to bring you to me just to watch a movie
Better yet to watch you climb into the jacuzzi
Bubbles in the bath don in the glass
Funny how time flies when you full of laughs
Its fun but before long a nigga gotta dash
For the lifestyle I live a nigga need cash
To come quick so I dont fuck with the stash
I know you like pumps and boots
I like jeeps and coupes so I grind all the time just gimme some loot
I put a spell on you I like to call it a spell
In the bedroom workin it well I dont kiss and tell
But I dont care if you kiss and tell
You can tell your girlfriend the detailsMan
You know where the niggas be at right
Take me to em
Chorus
All through the hood I keep hearin niggas sayin
Im supposed to die tonight pup pup pup pup pup pup
Niggas come put a hit out and they talkin like the shit okay
pup pup pup pup pup pup
Im down to ride tonight
We rollin whip stolen AK loaded
Im down to ride tonight
Its smokin street locin locked and loaded
Somebody gon die tonight
This is nothin new I been in the position before
Grandma crib niggas outside of her door
Different day same shit old mac new clip
Thirty two hollow tips gloves no rubber grip
Im a boss but niggas never show no respect
I catch em slippin I have em tongue kissin my tec
Want to come test me pussy boy dont try
Police responds never fast enough the shots fired
Dont be stupid find out who you fuckin wit son
Fore we find out where ya bitch gets her hair and nails done
Its elementary life is but a dream
You know row row ya boat your blood forms a stream
After you get hit you should of thought about the shit
You took that paper you take a life or ya life get took bitch
Sometimes I sit and look at life from a different angle
Dont know if Im Gods child or Im Satans angel
Chorus
In two thousand and two if you asked me to make a wish
I simply would of wished that my music would be a hit
Big said damn niggas want to stick me for my paper
And pray for my downfall I understand it all
But me Im a little more flashy a nigga
So chances are Ima have to blast me a nigga
Im on that teflon vest shit that wild wild west shit
And eighty one one carrot stones in my necklace
I shine so hard I make motherfuckers want to kill me
Every projects and every hood I go they feel me
Know it sounds like rap but this shit is real be
I dont talk that rich shit but nigga Im filthy
When I come out to play had my mom been with me
You could bet your bottom dollar that revolver with me
Homeboy frontin on me will shorten your life span
Hold the mic with my left the knife in my right hand
ChorusYeah

Oh Id lie for you baby
Oh Id die for you baby
I build you up
But if ever I fall down
And I need you to pick me up
Promise me youll be around
Hold me down
Ill build you up
Listen if you let me Ill be the reason you shine
Its a secret I want the world to know that youre mine
But on some real shit communications could be better
So Im writin a song instead of a love letter
They can play it on the radio a hundred times a day
I figure when you hear it you would stop and think of me
I want to get to know ya and be the reason you smile
Girl you know where Im from you know how I get down
When times are tough tell me that Im special
Not rap I mean me that Im special
You know they say diamonds are a girls best friend
Precious stones could you put me before them
If so Ill see to it that they always around
Nothin but the best now how does that sound
If I talk with you when we talk you can keep it
Girl you on my mind all the time its a secret
Baby Ill build you up
Girl if I never show I have you by my side
I build you up
Girl I need to know for sure youre mine
I need to know for sure
Baby Ill build you up
Girl if I never show I have you by my side
I build you up
Girl I need to know for sure youre mine
I need to know for sure
I think about you thinkin that you feel the same way
Was it just my imagination again runnin away
If you ready to ride girl come on lets roll
G-fifty-five fly ma lets go
Its hard to measure the pleasure of havin you in my present
Your smile makes me smile Ill show you my style
We can shop a lil bit I pick out my shit
One pair at a time till your shoe games sick
Now who knows what the future holds well be together probably
For better or worst like Whitney and Bobby
If you want to play house we can play house then
But wait why pretend if you can move in
Before I be your buddy in bed let me be your best friend
Girl its more than lust I want your trust
You keep it real with me Ill keep it real with you
Cause I know with you by my side theres nothin I cant do
Baby Ill build you up
Girl if I never show I have you by my side
I build you up
Girl I need to know for sure youre mine
I need to know for sure
Baby Ill build you up
Girl if I never show I have you by my side
I build you up
Girl I need to know for sure youre mine
I need to know for sureYeah
Yeah we can ride to this
Just lay back crew
Heres a taste of my life its bitter and sweet
I put my heart out to the sounds of the drums and the beat
I put my life on the line when Im out on the street
Put my Teflon on and roll with my heat
I keep my circle nice and small I dont fuck with these clown niggas
In a race for the cheese I run laps around niggas
Soon as I step on stage the crowd applauds
Soon as my sneaker wear in stores Reebok start sore
I aint gotta say Im a boss niggas can tell
The east coast crib the size of a small hotel
The shit journalist write about me get me confused
Have me feelin like the heavy weight champ when he lose
I read somewhere Im homophobic shit
Go through the hood theres mad niggas on my dick
Now we can get hostile or we can do this smooth
TT around I can still make blow move
This is what you call ryder music
All the gangstas are ridin to it
Lets roll I can show ya how we do it
When we ride to that ryder music lets go
Lets go
Last year I woke up a good look damn it feels good
On the low I done fucked half of Hollywood
Had your favorite actress from your favorite shows
In my favorite position you know how it goes
In my Bentley bumpin Prince shit This is When Thugs Cry
This is what it sounds like when hollow tip slugs fly
Homie this is somethin you can ride and smoke to
Stay on point cause niggas will ride and smoke you
Jealousys for women but some niggas is bitch made
They make you want to run across theyre head with a switch blade
They point their finger at me sayin Im bug
My flows crack you listen your fuckin brains on drugs
Look ice drippin on my neck hands grippin on the tec
Fool trippin through the set you can get ya ass whipped
Cards missin out my deck screws loose show respect
You try to come at me kid your ass better come correct
My mama gave birth to a winner I gotta win
Pray to Lord forgive me for my sins
Still thuggin cruisin rims gleamin
Like the stones on my wrist
Zonin guess this is how it feels to be rich
Homie you hustlin backwards if you chasin a bitch
Stupid chase the paper they come with the shit
Im fallin in love with success
Entrepreneur kinda sewer I maneuver the best
Rowin ruger on my lap rubber grip on the handle
Stunt Ill have ya homies burn a rest in peace candle
As wise men speak I listen and learn
A man dies a babys born my niggas the world turns
Rappers I make em sick when I say Im the shit
They mistake my confidence for arrogance they hate on the kid
In ninety-nine I had a vision and made a decision
Bein broke is against my religion now picked up
Chorus Chorus 
Yall niggas know what what yall niggas know what Im about
Yall niggas know find me at my do when the guns come out
I do this all the time stuck with a little shine
Walk with a little nine case I get in a bind
They say Im fuckin crazy they think Im out my mind
Cause Im down to bust a nigga head all the time
Now you know the hoes they know how I roll
In that new Rolls with the suicide doors
twenty-two inch chrome a nigga money low
You try to touch me I put out ya get ya brains blown
You go against the grain pussy and you on ya own
You right there in my zone welcome to the terridome
The ice blowin my chain blood blow in my veins
Blue still in the range Im doin my thang
The semi auto spray run if you get away
Ill find your whereabouts and clap at you another day
Nigga play with the bread get a hole in ya head
You touch a dime of mine thug and your ass dead
In the hood hoopty hate low niggas dont know Im around
Hop out hit em up lay my murder game down
You see me in ya projects one hundred and eighty-sevens in progress
Hard niggas finna soften up when that lead touch em
You cut em once and keep fight fuck it just keep cuttin em
Its real killa instinct kill or be killed
Trust me you dont want to feel how hollow tips feel
Fuck around and get ya cap peeled
Nigga you know the drill Brownsville
Flat bush ground heights Brooklyn Zoo
Feed the wolves they eat the food
And they fathom too
Nigga welcome to the jungle New York New York
Gangstas who signed actually let their guns talk

Im cool but if theres a problem I got extra clips
I dont know karate but I split the bricks
I dont love em loverboy we the shit bitch
Ill come through and touch ya walk out then cut ya
In case your dumbass want to tussle
Are-fifteen co-exist to make the shell case muffle
Scope run youre still dead
Hit your calf hit your ass hit ya back then your head
Contract killer murder for the scrilla
Search find a nigga run up behind a nigga
Shoot car windows out to flat line a nigga
Gun pop heart stop homie this is heavy
You on your way to meet your maker nigga are you ready

Motherfucker you retarded you touch fifty

Were walkin away from a beef in which clearly you started
I said were walkin away did you hear me you want to be thankful
That we aint beefin was to agree and just leave it at that
Thats when me fifty and G-Unit hop back in that bat mobile
It aint gonna be no more rappin its gonna be Reh
Retaliation will be like that Muslim shiite attack
Some where along the line its like me and fifty made a pact
Hes got my back I got his back back
Its almost like were kinda like Siamese twins
Cause when we beef we pull each other in
So well do shit like were conjoined at the hip
Its just unavoidable some of this shit is washable
And some shit will never boil up
And some of it will just simmer at best
If left at home well let it be so there wont be no sit downs
The days that Zino there will no peace discussions with me
There aint gon be no friendly debates over crumpets and tea
Just quit fuckin with me and Ill gladly quit fuckin with you
This bitch is sixteen and do what you gotta do to get through
Without mentionin me youre gonna sing to Jimmy Iovine and Dre and fifty
D-Twizzie Obie and just let it be or well be back with a

Got a money scheme Im plotting in the county and Im with it
You cross me and you goin make a cemetery visit
Thats gangsta you know me I told it cause I live it
Showcases drop when that chopper chop

When drama pop the llama pop
And it wont stop you can run call the cops
They say no niggas know how I be on it

Relapse you fat bitch dont ever try that again

You broke my heart you dirty bitch I wont forget what you did
If you give birth Ill already be in love with your kids

But we have a bond and its not to be broken
We got a love thing where you try to leave me

Your friends talk bad about me bitch you sit there and listen to em
Over and over you hurt me my love is unconditional
They talk to you when you up you down they got nothin to say
But when you call Ill come runnin Ill always take the pain away
They set you up to let you down they crowned you prom queen
Fiddle about me behind your back they call you a fuckin fiend

Plus me beside you no other man can loves you like I do
Call me daddy Ill make you feel good I mean real good
I found pleasure in pleasin you like a real man should
It was written long before it was carved in a tree
Forever me and you baby we were meant to be
Theres more to life than laughter what brought us together was fate
And well be hand in hand when you walk through those pearly gates

Got nowhere to go
Nowhere to run and hide
No matter how hard I try

Man the emotions change so I can never trust a bitch
I tried to help niggas get on they turned around and spit
Right in my face so Game and Buck both can suck a dick
Now when you hear em it may sound like its some other shit
Cause Im not writing anymore they not making hits
Im far from perfect theres so many lessons I done learned
If money is evil look at all the evil I done earned
Im doing what Im supposed to Im a writer Im a fighter
Entrepreneur fresh out the sewer watch me maneuver
Whats it to ya The track I lace it its better than basic
This is my recovery my comeback kid
My life my life
Makes me wanna run away
Theres no place to go
No place to go
All the confusion
Its an illusion like a movie
Got nowhere to go
Nowhere to run and hide
No matter how hard I try
While you were sipping your own Kool-Aid getting your buzz heavy
I was in the fucking sheds sharpening my machete
Sipping on some of that revenge juice getting my taste buds ready
To wolf down this spaghetti or should I say this spaghett-even
I think you fucking meatballs keep on just forgetting
Thought he was finished motherfucker its only the buginning
Hes buggin again hes straight thuggin fuck who hes offending
Hell rip your vocal chords out and have them bitches plugged in the
Motherfucking wall with three thousand volts of electrucity
Now take the other end of em then plug them motherfuckers in each
One of your eye sockets cause I thought you might finally fucking see
Thatll teach you to go voicing your cocksuckin opinion to me
I done put my blood my sweat and my tears in this shit
Fuck letting up youre gonna end up rugretting you ever betted against me
Feels like Imma snap any minute yeah its happening again
Im thinking about just saying
Mother fuck everybody thats up in this bitch but fifty
Cause this is all I know this is why so hard I go
I swear to God I put my heart and soul into this more than anybody knows
Im trapped so all I do is rap but every time I rap Im more trapped
And I rap myself right into this bubble oh I guess its bubble wrap
This is like a vicious cycle my lifes in a crisis
Christ how was I supposed to know shit would turn up like it did
Feels like Im going psycho again
And I might just blow my lid
Shit I almost wish that I would have never made Recovery kid
Cause Im running in circles with
My life my life
Makes me wanna run away
Theres no place to go
No place to go
All the confusion
Its an illusion like a movie
Got nowhere to go
Nowhere to run and hide
No matter how hard I try
I havent been this fucking confused since I was a kid
Sold like forty million records people forgot what I did
Maybe this is for me maybe
Maybe Im supposed to go crazy
Maybe Ill do it three AM in the morning like Shady
Psycho killer Michael Myers Im on fire like a lighter
Try to say this aint classic get your ass kicked mad quick
Wrap your head up in plastic pussy
Now pick the casket dirt nap with the maggots
Its tragic its sad its

Of every fucking thing livin

I represent niggas in the hood gettin rich
man I stack chips and I unload clips
after three Summers in the jail I thought life was hard
some niggas started fightin some niggas found God
you know me started sellin leek in the yard
yo I ran into niggas who used to have Hummers
big as Hell in the joint wearin eighty-six numbers
damm Dog you been in here that long
you could think that but say that and yo ass is dead wrong
a convo is only three words yo whattup
you aint gotta work out to leave this bitch cut up
let a nigga find out you on some goin home shit
and you tryin to bounce without payin a loan shit
some niggas beat cases on the strength of they cream
after the witnesses disappeared on the strength of they team
Im hard as Hell to get along wit so it never fails
a nigga I got beef with end up in the same jail
he had a L rolled in bible paper blowin the lye
I sent him a little kite just to be blowin his high
and when I shot you in NewYork why would I box you now
If I catch you in the yard Ima ox you down
niggas you think is real really cant hold they own
Ill have em on some ET shit tryin to phone home
in here a gemstar is like a Nine Milly chrome
its similar infact theyll both split ya dome
scars are souvenirs niggas always take em home
Chorus
You got blown over the jack that aint gangsta
Your Man ran when you got clapped that aint gangsta
rockin a vest with no gat that aint gangsta
you only a thug when you rap that aint gangsta
niggas jooked you for your track that aint gangsta
you ran to other thugs to get it back that aint gangsta
niggas ran off with your packs that aint gangsta
If you aint bustin ya gat that aint gangsta
Youd call me an Animal if you seen me livin on lock
I stay in a box cats be shook when Im visitin pop-ulation
when I walk by niggas like Fifty dont play Son
yeah somethin really wrong with that nigga
max out Im goin straight for the glock
bust a u-turn Im goin straight to the block
the things thatll happen if niggas say I cant eat
down goes the window out goes the heat
Ill make the whole block look like a fuckin trackmeet
some get it in the leg some get it in the back
some get it in the foot bleed all over their airmax
nigga pump my packs or pay poor tax
its extortion it happens in the hood often
claim more lives than choices free abortions
Rich Nice says I got a problem with the dice
cause I put the title to the Benz on the line twice
I rock shit cause I stay on that block shit
that ninemm Ruger to your knot shit
see the difference is Im real and you not kid
I still stash crack money in my sock shit
yall niggas wanna pop shit I pop clips
leave with your blood on my mink in the drop Six
Guiliani and Pataki cant stop this
since eighty-six my whole clique pop Criss
Chorus
five-five-one BLLLAAAP BLLLAAAP

What up fifty
Coming up I aint have much but I wanted a lot
I had paper for a hoopty but I wanted a drop
So you know I had make something outta nothin
Like turn an empty spot into a crack spot pumpin
Im so hard at nine-teen I bought a Benz I did
The older niggaz really wasnt feelin the kid
Try to find where I live so they could run in my crib
But you cant hustle a hustler I peeped it and slid
Back then Niggaz used to call me bo
At six months I told them Million go tops on gar-bo
Country came around hes into clappin
Country left same shit started happening
Like he shot rob for some ends Rob shot Joe for some skins
Cory shot Drew and we was friends
Money turned boys into men
The cycle never changes shit just starts again
Naw nigga aint nuthin changed nigga
Yeah Ive been gone for a minute but Im back
Damn fifty its good to see you back in the hood
You see my cherry-red SL nigga Im doin good
Sometimes I cant find the words to say how I feel
So I take a quote from menace Look at the wheels
Im addicted to stuntin now that Im holdin something
I got a trunk full of guns from VA to unverified
Oh will you let me hold something Nigga you high or something
I dont play games Im bout my money nigga buy something
I got a few fiveths I got a few nines
Here nigga take one
Yeah dont ever say I dont do nothing for you nigga
You know dont say I didnt look out for you know what I mean
But make sure nigga that you go catch some jokes
When you come back you gonna have my paper
For that thang thang know what Im sayin
I dont want it back dont try to use it then give it back to me
Cuz I yall niggaz now runnin around sayin
fifty getting all this rap money and he wont help us ha ha
Sit tight nigga Im comin you know New shit
All the shit I put out on the mix tapes is for the mix tapes

Oh my God my shit is so hot right now Im in the zoneLike the fire needs the air
I wont burn unless your there
Yea I need youI need you to hate
So I can use you for your energy
you know its real shit feel this
Americas got a thing for this gangstas shit they love me
Black Chucks black skullies leather Pelle-Pelle
I take spills over raymo shit Ima fan
Got through the silver duck tape on my trait old handle
The women on my life bring confusion shit
SO like Nino from New Jack Ill have to cancel that bitch
Look at me this is the life I chose
Niggaz around me so cold man my heart dun froze up
I build an empire on the low the narcs dont know
Im the weatherman I take that coco leaf and make that snow
Sit back watch it turn to dope watch it go out the door
O after O you know homey Im just triple beam dreamin
Niggaz be schemin Im fiendin to live a good life
The fiends just fiendin
Conceal my weapon nice and easy so you cant see
The penitentiary is definitely out the question for me
Chorus
I want the finer things in my life
So I hustle hustle
Nigga you get in my way when while Im tryin to get mine
And Ill buck you buck you
I dont care who you run with or where you from
Nigga fuck you fuck you
I want to find the thing thats in my life
So I hustle hustle
Yea I dont know shit about gymnastics I summersault bricks
Black talents start flyin when a nigga flip
I cook crack in the microwave niggaz cant fuck with me
Man my cold days they called me chef boy are fifty
Check my logic smokers dont like seeds in their weed shit
Send me them seeds ill grow em what they need
Them aint chia pet plants in the crib thats chronic
And Im sellin them five hundred a pop god damn it
I sold everythin Ima hustler I know how to grind
Step on grapes put in water and tell you its wine
If you analyze me what youll find is the DNA recrock
What goes in my mind its contagious
Hypnotic it sounds melodic
If the rap was the block or spider Ill be poke and butter
Now get a load of me flashy far from low key
And you can locate me where ever that dope be gettin money man
Chorus
Its a hustlers ambition close your eyes listen see my vision
Mossberg pumpin shotgun dumpin and drama means nothin
Its part of the game catch me in the coupe switchin lanes
In the jewels with your chains
I upgrade from thirty BS to clean VS
Rocks that I copped procedes from the spot
I got the energy to win Im full of adrenaline
Played it perf and get nauseous watchin the spinner spin
I make plans to make it a prisoner of the state
Now I can invite yo ass out to my estate
Them holi tip bent me up but Im back in shape
Pour Crystal in the blender and make a protein shake
Im like the East coast number one playboy B
Hugh Hefnerll tell you he dont got shit on me
The feds watch me icey they cant stop me
Racist pointin at me look at the nigga ratchi
Hello
ChorusVerse one - Nas
Hats off to da rich ones who flash and floss
Pour some liquors out to my dogs trapped up north
Reminisce on the deceased who no longer exist
Only wishin we could bring them back with songs like dis
Old flicks on us chillin wit da old time click
Holdin nines thoughts of death not our lives we risk
How it use to be early morn pumpin in shifts
Jakes wit pale faces in the night is the scariest
They handcuff me they knew my government and alias
Various calls were made up for awarin us
The Ds in the marked vans and cabs
In our land hoodrats get stapped by niggas who forty
Turnin out young ladys and make them make thoughties
Got them coked out the hood is bugged out
Thug babies famous in they strollers
Before they walk they knew the hood talk
Its in the air of New York
So everybodyll pick em up kissin em up
Treatin them like they own in dis hood we call home
Fist fight till we grown and these guns come out
Circle of life its kinda deep how we end out
Chorus
Yo them niggas that wanted beef before
Dont want no beef no mo
Now that they know who I rep with
QB NIGGA
Who I rep with
QB NIGGA repeat
Yall niggas better sober up before yall speak to me dont come at me high
Last rapper that raised his voice to me got japped in da eye
Now if I say Im gone get you Ima get ya
On da strength of da inf from long range I can hit ya
You find out them niggas who wit ya aint even wit ya
After da gem stars split ya you need an MD to stitch ya
Peep how I use words to paint pictures
Peep how I got niggas with bodies askin me for ten cents to got hit ya
Look my name up in the law book Curtis Jackson
Known for creatin action by rapidly clappin
Nigga I stay strapped so much I nickname gats
Got a tech I call Tina a nine I name Nina
Two niggas went to see Allah afta they seen her
This QB shit bout to take me to da next level
Next crib next Benz next bitch next bezel
Its that real
Chorus
Yo aiyyo who da fuck wanna war

Smack your man down you ran off
I was gonna hit him with two I left some for you
I put four QB rugged and raw
I got somethin for these rap cats fish held back gats
Scope wit a beam on it loc put your cream on it
Shine dont scheme on it I make your dream about it
Forever whatever whatever get gully
Shots thru your leather and clothe With your skelly off
Break yall clowns off
Yo hollow tips will flood your jacket I dont give a fuck who you be
Millennium Thug now who da fuck want it with me
I mastered the art of slap boxin niggas in da dark
QBs big man Horse of the Bravehearts
Im da Sasquash of rap collector of gats
Testin macks at your bulletproof vests and hats
How bout that guns bust off I bust back
When trucks backfire I bust back
How bout that stomp a muhfuckin rib out ur back
Yall niggas aint gangsta rap yall click like Josey and the Pussycats
When we come around da front stop
Uh huh yall cant fuck around yall get dropped
When guns pop whos tellin
Twin barrel nines wavin and yellin QB NIGGA WHAT
Two-time felon straight to da melon straight to da dome
Send a nigga back get da shells go straight home
Never slip my Ill Will to survive is so deep
Cant sleep cousin to death makes me weak
Pullin triggers at my shadow Bravehearts pop up
Wiz Jungle and Horse shot your block up
Them niggas that wanted war before
Dont want no war no mo
Now that they know who I rep wit
QB NIGGA
Who I rep wit
QB NIGGA repeatYo Black is flashy like Alpo gun happy like Pappy
Sneaky muthafucka remind me of nigga that crack me
He aint the type you shoot dice with and win dog
Unless you want to get your ass layed out in gilmore
Yes we soldiers remind me Troy and E-Bags
When they came through they hollored like What up Conrad
Grimey niggaz they loved to get gully
Summertime still had on black gloves and scullies
The Lex four hundred and fifty pulled up thats Cornbread
Them niggaz from Philly would of called him an old head
But he an OG remind me of Chaz and Bump real low key
Sounded like he didnt know nothing about drama
For this money shit many men do trauma
Switchy walked in son this bitch had the baddest ass
The bulletproof glass was rolled up on the S-Class
Heard in DC he kept mad blocks in order
Picture this a young nigga gettin it like Rich Porter
Sonny came in for half a pit
He got knocked he on lock still controllin his block from constop
Pop pulled up in the CLfive his project changed
His man just got fucking murked by Salene
Heard he got it in the range nigga Bean popped one in his brain
Over some-thing took his watch and his chain
Country boys off the hook down there and Richmond main
In the black seven hundred and forty I sat hat turned back
Bow down baby nelly singing my wrist blinging What
Im waiting on this nigga Wise we lost for two pies
Son he smokin that shit I can see it in his eyes
Coming up wise emotions closed
Most buying round looking for wisemen toast
Benny hopped out the Esculade with a few thourough men from B-More
They sellin heroin in Maryland reverse back to Diesel
Killed like four fiends his popularity grew that only meant more cream
First it was him and his brother now he got a team
Went from five and a half grams to living the dream
City pulled up Goddamn you know his format
Bentley is all marble in the door and floor match
Got the gats out the stash box popped two glocks
Peace All Eyez on Me twoPac
Everybody know he a boss he gotta floss
He on the same bullshit that sent Gotti up north
Thats Dime in the blue ts stunting like he Nicky Barnes
He broke but he talk like he a Don
Homes hoppin out the Jag thats Max haitian cat
Kill a nigga quick remind me of Haitian Jack
I peep his style son I know his stelo He on the d-low
He smile at niggaz mumbling fuck you in Creole
Heard war stories bout how he maneuver with the Ruger
Hold the iron horizontally and send shots through ya
Few niggaz tried to murk him most them got fount
Some turnt away try to run they in wheelchairs now
Banks hopped out bulletproof this bulletproof that
Bulletproof snorkel bulletproof hat
Got out a Black hummer he blew ninety on that
Poppin mad shit like he gonna bulletproof that lets gofifty Cent
Ah-ha man Ay you know where them niggaz be at right
click-clack Take me to em
All through the hood I keep hearin niggaz sayin
- Im supposed to die tonight
Niggaz done put a hit out and they talkin like the shit okay
- Im down to ride tonight
We rollin whip stolen AK golden
- Im down to ride tonight
Weed smokin straight locn lock and loadin
- Somebody gon die tonight
This is nuttin new I been in this position before
Grandma crib niggaz outside of her door
Different day same shit old mac new clip
thirty-two hollow-tips gloves no rubber grip
Im a boss but niggaz never show no respect
I catch em slippin Ill have em tongue-kissin my tec
Gwan come test me pussy bwoy dont try it
Police response never fast enough to shots fired
Dont be stupid find out who you fuckin with son
Fore we find out where yo bitch get her hair and nails done
Its elementary life is but a dream
You know row row your boat your blood forms a stream
After you get hit you shoulda thought about the shit
You took that paper you take a life or yo life get took bitch
Sometimes I sit and look at life from a different angle
Dont know if Im Gods child or Im Satans angel
Chorus
In two thousand and two if you asked me to make a wish
I simply woulda wished that my music would be a hit
Big said Damn - niggaz wanna stick me for my paper
And pray for my downfall I understand it all
But me Im a little more flashy a nigga
So chances are Ima have to blast me a nigga
Im on that Kevlar and vest shit that wild wild West shit
Theres eighty-one one carat stones in my necklace
I shine so hard I make motherfuckers wan kill me
Every projects in every hood I go they feel me
Know it sounds like rap but this shit is real B
I dont talk that rich shit but nigga Im filthy
When I come out to play and my mob aint with me

Homeboy frontin on mell shorten your lifespan
Hold the mic with my left my knife in my right hand

See Im tired of all these rappin niggas dyin to shine
And Im tired of fiends askin for a dime for nine
Hearing this next punch line from me may sound strange
You sit your five-dollar ass down before I make change
Yo the sale went stale caught em real bad
Fresh out the jail shit is really real
Niggas is still in jail and I pray they dont tell
twenty-man inditement my lawyer gotta fight this
Niggas know I aint never pressed for dough
And niggas know I dont serve nobody I dont know
Son said he was from OT pay eleven an oz
My man brought em to me see he aint really know b
That it was hot dude was a cop
He was just tryin to pop to put the new beams on his drop
First I served him ozs then I served him whole keys
Now we all co-des damn man I OD

Po-Po walking to beat we burnin ls up in the jeep

Chorus

and a figure thatll leave a nigga droolin and shit
There I was kickin my game pickin her brain
buggin cause a while back I met this bitch on the train
she wasnt feelin me I pulled up she wouldnt talk from the whip
Uptown girl she feel like thats some chickenhead shit
but on the sidewalk we aint play games
we exchanged numbers and names
I went back to the Range
I heard her Girlfriend whisperin I know that nigga he rich
she think I got six whips cause me and my Man switch
anyway her name is CeCe
she said she go to BMCC
push a ninety-eight three hundred and twenty-eight with chrome BBs
she said she seen me in the Onyx video on TV
she liked my part the best man this bitch is tryin to G me
Chorus
Its hard as Hell to find a Girl thats really down for ya

Hey Shorty why you like me huh you like the way I spit
oh I hit your girlfriend she told you bout the dick

platinum iced out got rid of that gold shit
I love my lifestyle you too you love it
that I could blow Twenty Thousand and think nothin of it
know you wouldnt fuck with me if I had no ends
probably wouldnt fuck in the whip if it wasnt a Benz
I guess life looks different through them Shanel tints
Man I dont care if these hoes love me or not
long as I rhyme hot Im gettin head in my drop
it goes on and on and on and it dont stop
Chorus
One thing you can always count on is change
and a rich nigga to come put shit in the game
had a forty then Jigga made you trade your Range
wouldve felt broke if you couldnt get your change
now its hard to find us or stay behind us
while we on the nine hundred double R Hondas
watch the cats who flip bricks recline in the latest whips
while Penetentiaries stay packed with cats who sling packs
all these hoes aint Madonna fans but all across the World
you can find a material Girl
I sip Dom till I earl
take em two at a time
quick I get in they mind
have em thinkin they mine
bust off then tell em Bust a Uey on mo time
Im like the reason yall niggas cant eat this year

Yo Shorty tell your friends yall aint fuckin with us
aww man look he aint mean that shit
cmon thats just records niggas is playin
we wasnt serious and shittalking
Uh huh uh huh uh huh
Southside what yall niggas know about the dirty south
One time
Chorus
Lord forgive me for Ive sinned
Over and over again just to stay on top
I recall memories filled with sin
Over and over again and again
Yo when you hear talk of the southside you hear talk of the team
See niggas feared Prince and respected Preme
For all you slow muthafuckas Im a break it down iller
See Preme was a business man and Prince was the killer
Remember he used to push the bulletproof BM uh huh
This here get ya seasick I sat back and peeped shit
The roll with Easy Wider and they aint get blunted
Had the whole projects workin for fifty on five-hundred
As a youth all I ever did was sell crack
I used to idolize cat
Hurt me to my heart to hear that nigga snitched on Pap how he go out like
that
Rumors in the hood was Jes was snitchin
I aint believe that pa he helped me cop my first GSX-R
Had the four-runner the Z the five and the three
Used to drive his truck through the hood draggin jet skis
From Gerald Wallace to Baby Wise dont be suprised
Of how freely I thought of names of guys who dealt with pies
Like LA and Wise L got shot in the neck then told his connect
Them niggas who shot em got em for ten bricks
Fuckin Dominicans turned around and gave em more bricks
Chorus
That first verse is just a dose of the shit that Im on
Consider this the first chapter in the ghettos Quran
I know a lot of niggas that get dough like Bimmy and Joe
And Prince and Rightous from Hillside with the mole on his nose
Throughout my struggles through the hood I started learnin
Lifes a bitch with a pretty face but she burnin
Man Im a get cheese like Chaz then run through whips like Cigar
Gamble all the time like country-curly head Prince and Tata
Po-po under pressure too they know what they facin
Go against crews like B-Bo and killers like Pappy Mason
A lotta niggas I know been corrupted since birth
Enticed to rob nuns for fun for everything they worth
I know some cats that hail at old complexes like Cooley Wall
Together niggas stand and divided they fall
Round here shook niggas they keep it in motion
Come around here with your rollie you can get robbed like Ocean
Lord knows Tommy had loved and sold
Helicopters Rolls Royces with Louie Vuitton interior
Might sound like Im fantasizin but son Im dead serious
Montanna was no dummy brought Benice to wash the money
Had money out the ass he politic like the Asian
FEDs couldnt catch him dirty so settled for tax evasion
Chorus
Yo rest in peace to Rich and Ron money what they was about yo
The twins was from queens but got crazy cream with Alpo
Throughout my time I heard tales of Himey Frenchy Jamaican Pauly Ducky
Cally
Rodney Bump and Chick shit
A lot a niggas flow the way I flow
but aint been in the game all their life so dont know who I know
Writin rhymes is the best way I express how I feel
If I aint rich by twenty-six Ill be dead or in jail
Comin up I heard sippin to much boozell leave you confused
And if you watch the news you see playas in this game that lose
Im forgettin Lefty and Jazz Pretty Tony and Lance
Head Lou Mel son Troy and E Money Bags
And a conversation over shrimp and lobster
And Benny Hiners heard Chico stopped boxin and started robbin diners
Shout out to Clanvis and Clutch Bob Dre Black Will
If the flow dont kill you the Mac will
Chorusfifty Cent and Eminem
Yeah Shady
Haha Wooo
fifty Cent GgGgG G Unit
Haha Here we go again
Yeah Uh huh Haha
fifty Cent
Does it make you mad when I switch my flow
You cant understand how I get my dough
fifty Cent Im on fire cause shady said so Im On Fire
Eminem
Here we go now
Everybodies in a rush to try to get the throne
I just get on the track and try to set the tone
Aint trying to use nobody as a steppin stone
But dont compare me Im better off just left alone
And I aint even tryin to go there with record sales
Im just tryin to keep it humble and respect myself
Say what what up keep steppin and just rep Dtwelve
Keep my nose clean stay away from weapons jail
And livin wreckless but if you would check my belt
You may see soemthing else I use to protect myself
A vest to stop a ruger and deflect the shells and
Send em back at you faster than they left the barrel
And I dont even carry guns no more I dont got to
Got under cover cops thatll legally pop you
And I done seen a lot of people crossed the line
But this motherfucker Ja mustve lost his mind
That X has got him thinkin that he was DMX
Then he switched to Pac now his tryin to be him next
So which one are you X Luther Pac or Michael
Just keep singing the same song recycled
Wed all much rather get along than fight you
Me and hailey dance to your songs we like you
And you dont really want to step inside on my group
Come on now you know the white boy will bite you
Ill hurt your pride dog and you know I dont like to
But I will if I have to
With syllable after syllable ill just slap ya
Killin you faster
Than you poppin pill after little pill of them tabs of
That shit you on but if you want it you got it
Youd bump this shit too if we didnt diss you on it
But if we lock horns we can charge harder than Busta
We bump heads with any motherfucker that wants ta
So whats the deal where was all of the tough talk
When I walked up to ya like Ja what up dog
How come you didnt say you had a problem then
When you was standin there with all you men
We couldve solved it then Im a grown man dogg come holla
All you did was slap hands smile and swallow
Another one of them lil x pills in front of me
And tell me fifty Cent was everything you want to be Cmon
I know you dont want it with me
You know you dont want it with me
You can talk Im still the mc
You dont want to bump heads with me
You couldnt slug me if my father helped you
My punchlines is hot my bars would melt you
Ja you stuart little shells will lift you
Every other week Im buyin a new pistol
I clap at yo ass with this chrome thirty-eight
And put six through yo hat so seven in three eights
Erv you aint shug knight you shook light
I put my knife in ya wind pipe
Then freeze on this turn pike
You know and I know who took ya chain
You got rolled two times so your ass is lame
Im down to die for this shit all I need is bail
You better stick to the movies with segal
Yo fuck that Im tired of these -
Industry niggas unknown you get out of hand
Im gone find you whereabouts unknown
We kill in new york even in Compton they understand
Im on the block where you was raised unknown
They see me poppin more ice because I could unknown
You probably forgot your way around the hood good
Least when your paranoid its hard to make a song
How you want it with us and laugh unknown got make up on
Every magazine I open you on your knees takin prayer pictures
And you aint even got shot yet you scared bitches
You dont know nothin bout what pain is sucker
I put put your ass in the ground like a train conductor motherfucker

Scream murder I dont believe you
Murder Fuck around and leave you

Or niggas in the mess hall gettin shot on shallow lines
An old timer schooled me dont burn bridges my friend
Imagine the G-Dub close and yo ass gotta swim
I watch the fifth melt a nigga melt a nigga of the sidewalk of New York
Me and shorty saw from afar and had a talk
He said I told em if he came around Id clap him I gave him my word
Look at his head its still shakin he had alot of nerve
If it wasnt for the flow
Id probably have to double Back bubble crack

If it wasnt for the flow
Id probably have to double Back bubble crack
yea yea Im a hustler
If it wasnt for the flow
Id probably have to double Back bubble crack
yea yea Im a hustler
Yo when the fed come in the game loyalty is limited
Hardcore niggas start actin feminine
With the feds you do eighty five percent of your time
Duke you get ten youll damn near do nine
Hate a liar more than I hate thief
A thief is only after my salary a liar is after my reality
The streets I knowem like my ABCs
Stay away from the Ds and stack ya cheese
Try to see three hundred gs fore you see three hundred Cs
Tree top to feel the breeze co connect for keys
Yo bitches sexin me take me to ecstacy
Once I nut ahh oh shit I dont want em next to me
If its on mother fucker believe Im gonna ride
Im the type to swallow my blood fore I swallow my pride
Letters on my shirt read DKNY
Got grimy niggas runnin with me from BKNY
If it wasnt for the flow
Id probably have to double Back bubble crack
yea yea Im a hustler
They say I dont sound like a killer well how a killer sound
I bet I grab a foe pound and back that ass down
See many men live baby and many men die
Many men get drunk puff lah and stay high
Heres a jewel love you enemies and hate your friends
Your enemies remain the same friends always change
I dont quit that theres more that one way to skin a cat
You can get him in the face dog or down his back
All bullshit aside now its time to be honest
I fear no man for death is all thats promised
I got niggas standin in line waitin to hear me spit
From eighty six to ninety six the game went from sugar to shit
This for you niggas in the background dyin to shine
I hate you like fiends who ask for a dime for nine
Dont nothin change in the game but faces and names
Skate to wait to date and the jake
If it wasnt for the flow
Id probably have to double Back bubble crack
yea yea Im a hustlerUh huh uh huh uh huh South side

Enticed to rob nuns for fun for everything they worth
I know some cats that hail at old complexes like Cooley Wall
Together niggas stand and divided they fall
Round here shook niggas they keep it in motion
Come around here with your rollie you can get robbed like Ocean
Lord knows Tommy had loved and sold
Helicopters Rolls Royces with Louie VaTonne interior
Might sound like Im fantasizin but son Im dead serious
Montanna was no dummy brought Benice to watch the money
Had money out the ass he politic like the Asian
Feds couldnt catch him dirty so settled for tax evasion
Lord forgive me for Ive sinned
Over and over again just to stay on top
I recall memories filled with sin
Over and over again and again
Yo rest in peace to Rich and Ron money what they was about yo
The twins was some queens but got crazy cream with Alpo
Throughout my time I heard tales of Himey
Frenchy Jamaican Pauly Ducky Cally
Rodney Bump and Chick shit a lot a niggas flow the way I flow
But aint been in the game all their life so dont know who I know
Writin rhymes is the best way I express how I feel
If I aint rich by twenty-six Ill be dead or in jail
Comin up I heard sippin too much boozell leave you confused
And if you watch the news you see playas in this game that lose
Im forgettin Lefty and Jazz Pretty Tony and Lance
Head Lou Mel son Troy and E Money Bags
And a conversation over shrimp and lobster
And Benny Hiners heard Chico stopped boxin
And started robbin diners shout out to Clanvis and Clutch
Bob Dre Black Will if the flow dont kill you the Mac will
Lord forgive me for Ive sinned
Over and over again just to stay on top
I recall memories filled with sin
Over and over again and againMadd Rapper

Jim Star crush your head give your ass a shape-up
Uptown niggas known for the money they make
Everybody aint shook you see doing the shake
The boss spending ends
Saying Gimme that Benz twenty inch rims and four TVs
The snitch in the precinct saying
He sell X he sell techs and he sell D
The balla by the bar saying
Everybody drink the best champagne its all on me
Snitch in the back of the police car
Pointing out the window saying He robbed me
Its elementary

Lloyd Banks in the house
Now get the fuck on the floor I slid through the front door
With the nine and the velor a cal in my pocket
You will Ima pop it Im down for a profit
Im ghetto as hell you cant you tell
My road dog under the jail getting frustrating mail
So Im drinking and smoking thinking and hoping
This cell gon open you can dance next to me
But dont throw an elbow Ill throw one back
And leave blood on your Shell Toes
Hell no I aint paying for pleasure
Your pussy dont bring rainbows and pots of treasure
Its every girls dream to floss with the team
Long on the suine DVDs on the screen
Blowing on cream waiting for you to scheme
You aint gotta know how to read to spray a magazine
The boss spending ends
Saying Gimme that Benz twenty inch rims and four TVs
The snitch in the precinct saying
He sell X he sell techs and he sell D
The balla by the bar saying
Everybody drink the best champagne its all on me
Snitch in the back of the police car
Pointing out the window saying He robbed me

When I use them big words your bitch be feeling me
So yall niggas hate me cause your wives be our groupies
Yall irritate me like loud people in the movies
Fall back matter fact back down
Cause I just passed security without no pat down
You can catch me in the bathroom blowing a sticky
Or catch me on the dance floor feeling some tits
Sex sells so Ima P I M P
So my pockets never be empty
It aint no problem we scoop them models
We got condoms coups and lavish condos
fifty got me getting ass like I never did
So when I step in the club hoes love the kid
The boss spending ends
Saying Gimme that Benz twenty inch rims and four TVs
The snitch in the precinct saying
He sell X he sell techs and he sell D

My opinion of a sweet dream is a dead NARC

When it comes to bad bitches you know I got them
Some from Long Beach some from some from Compton
You know a nigga wanna see how Cali girls freak off
After that five hour flight from New York
I start spitting G at a bitch like a pimp man
Tell her meet me at the so we can do our thing
She can bring the lingerie with her I suppose
And we can go from fully dressed to just having no clothes
She can run and tell her best friend bout my sex game
Her best friend could potentially be next man
Listen man shit changed

Holdin nines thoughts of death not our lives we risk
How it use to be early morn pumpin in shifts
Jakes wit pale faces in the night is the scariest
They handcuff me they knew my government and alias
Various calls were made up for awarin us
The Ds in the marked vans and cabs
In our land hoodrats get stapped by niggas who forty
Turnin out young ladys and make them make thoughties
Got them coked out the hood is bugged out
Thug babies famous in they strollers
Before they walk they knew the hood talk
Its in the air of New York
So everybodyll pick em up kissin em up
Treatin them like they own in dis hood we call home
Fist fight till we grown and these guns come out
Circle of life its kinda deep how we end out

She aint even have to run to get away with the bread
Thats some fucked up shit
Think about that kid
Im thinking what this bitch thinking when she take me to court
I pay my child support what the fuck she want
This relationship shit its too much for me
I wanna fuck your friends and live comfortably
She wanna shine and blow minds on shopping sprees
She should have what she wants just not for me
Im thinking bout my future she part of my past
She dont care bout me she just want some cash
Im thinking damn girl we used to be friends
How did sh-t become all about ends
Chorus
Do you think about me

Sing-sing is where he biddin
She in the Gucci tights and Findi high heals
Baby wipes and cans of Infamil
Moter bike and grams of fish scale

And all the prank calls was death threats that bitch had the best sex
All across the globe and the bitch head game was out of control
Girl you know I like it when you climb on top
Love muscles feel tighter than a headlock

And my down bitch as a holster like Im supposed to
Heavy pistol sales for living
My gun rip through lungs and tear through tissue
While Im out for the ends you out for a rep
Thats the same thing that have yo mama in a black dress
See me in a black lex hard-top
My mink drop-top fresh out the carlot
I got the gift of raw pugilist speeches
So Im goin sell like the box office features
Niggas in the hood cant see G-UNIT
But deep in they heart they want to be G-UNIT
Cause we got them three Bs benzes burners and bitches
And plus we on the road to the riches
You can say what you want about me
As long as you dont get in the way of my money
Cause all that talking shit to me played out
Nigga keep bumping your gums you get laid out
Lloyd Banks
Lately I been going through a phase
Hope they aint tap the phones
Cause we got pumps the size of saxophones
Therefore Im on the move with the squad
Im stingy as ever known to trick fast food on a broad
Picture me putting jewels on a broad
Id rather put shoes on the car
A pool in the yard
You dont really want to fool with the god
Nigga my front line long enough to fill two boulevards
In this game you only make it far if you loyal
And if you grew up with your mother and your father you spoiled
Why swing you gotta be strapped to get rid of me
Ill leave you in water like the statute of liberty
Tryin to be cool
Blowin green that strong enough to make a white boy open fire on a school
Keep rappin for your hood Im rappin for Benzes
And long assault rifles with straps on the lenses

And them out of town niggas Im chargin whyall more

Gimme his watch and his chain

Crap table in Vegas had his bitch on my dick

Chorus
One thing you can always count on is change

I rap a muthafucking house around my my wrist for wreck
While you niggas race neck to neck
While niggas who live from cheque to tech
I aint even going to front I aint working with a full deck
Life in the hood so hard I done lost some of my cards
Instead of praying before I sleep I put my hands on my heat
As soon as I start dreaming Im right back on the street
Any nigga in this game flowing they think they can see me

My back on the wall now you gon see
Better watch how you talk when you talk about me
Cause Ill come and take your life away
Many men many many many many men
Wish death pon me
Lord I dont cry no more
Dont look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me
Now these pussy niggas putting money on my head
Go on and get your refund motherfucker I aint dead
Im the diamond in the dirt that aint been found
Im the underground king and I aint been crowned
When I rhyme something special happen every time
Im the greatest something like Ali in his prime
I walk the block with the bundles
Ive been knocked on the humble
Swing the ox when I rumble
Show your ass what my gun do
Got a temper nigga go head lose your head
Turn your back on me get clapped and lose your legs
I walk around gun on waist chip on my shoulder
Till I bust a clip in your face pussy this beef aint over
Many men many many many many men
Wish death pon me
Lord I dont cry no more
Dont look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me
Have mercy on my soul
Somewhere my heart turned cold
Have mercy on many men
Many many many many men
Wish death upon me
Sunny days wouldnt be special if it wasnt for rain
Joy wouldnt feel so good if it wasnt for pain
Death gotta be easy cause life is hard
Itll leave you physically mentally and emotionally scarred
This if for my niggas on the block twisting trees and cigars
For the niggas on lock doing life behind bars
I dont see only god can judge me cause I see things clear
Quick these crackers will give my black ass a hundred years
Im like Paulie in Goodfellas you can call me the Don
Like Malcolm by any means with my gun in my palm
Slim switched sides on me let niggas ride on me
I thought we was cool why you want me to die homie
Many men many many many many men
Wish death pon me
Lord I dont cry no more
Dont look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me
Have mercy on my soul
Somewhere my heart turned cold
Have mercy on many men
Many many many many men
Wish death upon me
Every night I talk to god but he dont say nothing back
I know he protecting me but I still stay with my gat
In my nightmares niggas keep pulling techs on me
Psych says some bitch dumb put a hex on me
The feds didnt know much when Pac got shot
I got a kite from the pens that told me Tuck got knocked
I aint gonna spell it out for you motherfuckers all the time
Are you illiterate nigga You cant read between the lines
In the bible it says what goes around comes around
Almost shot me three weeks later he got shot down
Now its clear that Im here for a real reason
Cause he got hit like I got hit but he aint fucking breathing
Many men many many many many men
Wish death pon me
Lord I dont cry no more
Dont look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me
Have mercy on my soul
Somewhere my heart turned cold
Have mercy on many men
Many many many many men
Wish death upon meIm on parole I used to be on probation
Im with my gun I get full corporation
I tell you take it off no hesitation
Nigga you play around I lay you down
Thats how its goin down
Dont play wit me I dont have patients
My headachin and I need my medication
Niggas be hatin they dont know what they facin
Nigga you play around I lay you down

Nigga witness against me Im a erase em
If they try an runaway Im a chase em
Now with the pound and Im a lay em down

Chorus
Better watch how you talk
Better watch where you walk
On the streets of New York
Thats how we get down
twenty-twos on the jeep
Somethin deep in the seat
When we creep wit the heat
Thats how we get down
Wise men listen and laugh while fools talk
Stick up kids dont live long in New York
Fuck around and catch the wrong jukes on the street
Get caught slippin then get hit wit like three

And if Im focused while Im strokin I could change how you walk
Theres a swagger that you calm but when you come from New York

Separate me from the rest I feel like Im the best
If theres a price to pay for feelin you I pay that twice

After three summers in the joint I thought life was hard
Some niggas started fightin some niggas found God
You know me started sellin leek in the yard
Yo I ran into niggas who used to have Hummers big as Hell
In the joint wearin eighty-six numbers damn Dog you been in here that long
You could think that but say that and yo ass is dead wrong
A convoy is only three words Yo whattup
You aint gotta work out to leave this bitch cut up
Let a nigga find out you on some goin home shit
And you tryin to bounce without payin a loan shit
Some niggas beat cases on the strength of they cream
After the witnesses disappeared on the strength of they team
Im hard as Hell to get along wit so it never fails
A nigga I got beef with end up in the same jail
He had a L rolled in bible paper blowin the lye
I sent him a little kite just to be blowin his high
And when I shot you in New York why would I box you now
If I catch you in the yard Ima ox you down
Niggas you think is real really cant hold they own
Ill have em on some ET shit tryin to phone home
In here a gem star is like a Nine Milly chrome
Its similar in fact theyll both split ya dome
Scars are souvenirs niggas always take em home
You got blown over the jack
That aint gangsta
Your Man ran when you got clapped
That aint gangsta
Rockin a vest with no gat
That aint gangsta
You only a thug when you rap
That aint gangsta
Niggas jocked you for your track
That aint gangsta
You ran to other thugs to get it back
That aint gangsta
Niggas ran off with your packs
That aint gangsta
If you aint bustin ya gat
That aint gangsta
Youd call me an Animal if you seen me livin on lock
I stay in a box cats be shook when Im visitin pop-ulation
When I walk by niggas like Fifty dont play Son
Yeah somethin really wrong with that nigga

Nigga yous front you gon get shot down

Nigga aint nuttin change you move Ill blow your brains
These niggaz dont really want war
They just walk around frontin cause I walk around stuntin
Why you think the long pump is in the trunk for
If you really want somethin we can show up at your front door
I know my history my family tree dont said Master
Fuck livin positive cause negativity spreads faster
A celebrity has ta bulletproof his car
Cause big hits come flyin through ya door like Casper
Im smokin out the jar scopin out the bar
Distracted see shorty breast pokin out the bra
Not the type to go spark metal in
Start thinkin you gangsta cause you hit a park yellow van
Act hard but ya heart made a marshmallows man
Talk tough til you get cuffed and start tellin damn
Everyday I got a new bitch and when Im done wit her
Itll look like she dived head first in the pool wit it
You only gon wind up dead tryin to prove shit
I put chalk around ya head like a pool stick
I gotta have bucks on the waist
Im hungry like a South African with fly stuck to his face
Catch Banks in a truck full of bass
Remember Im a bachelor the four or five ducks outta space
You could either get bucked or get ya ass jumped
The only trigger you can touch is on a gas pump
I got my own personal slave she really got a curfew
Cook and clean for the kid like silly in color purple
I know you wanna pop me but if I hit you first
The exit wound gon be the size of a hockey puck
Fuck I really hold the rubber
I send sparks at you and I dont mean Emilio or Bubba
Im aimin for a video cover huge tall bustas
A pound and a philly hold the smuggler
G-Units whats up right now
The Gucci cloth is on a Newport sign upside down
You gotta come a little harder nigga
You wear jerseys while mine a throwback and yours is a Starter
You still gotta beg a hoe
And you mad cause you blowin on oregano
You niggazll never blow anyone to step in my ring is brave
I dont know a thing about hair stylin but I can make a finger weave
Short stay leave her butt in the telly
Lace up the beef and broccolis peanut butter and jelly
Im about to get this deal shorty know
Thats why she foamin out the grill like a Alka-Seltzer pill
I aint loud around a snitch
I dont crowd around a bitch
The jumpsuit match wit the Carolina kicks
I been sick since niggaz was on Harlod Miner dick
I could call up a chick and put a child around her lips
Niggaz cant stand the fact that Im real
I kidnap the queen from the castle and put her back on the pill
Gimme Barbie at her best Bacardi at the chest
Im similar to the young Marcus Darvy at the desk
Useta have ta push up now I hardly got to press
Got two gun and both lead to cardiac arrest
My success got suckers salty blowin steam like a cup of coffee
Click POW get these fuckas off me
I hear a lotta talkin niggaz must be mad at Banks

And they dont know who hit him
The hood talkin man everybody know
I know its fucked up
Now I lay thee down to sleep
Niggas tryin to lay me down with heat
If I should die do before I awake
I pray my Lord my soul to take
If dead men could talk in your sleep
And your homie told you who got him
Would you have the heart to shoot the nigga that shot him
Or would you start switchin up
You think about the penitentiary your bitchin up
What if he said money aint everything
The hood raised us wrong
What it takes to get your money long
But look Im gone
Would that touch your heart have you feelin funny inside
Would that be enough to make your punk ass ride
What if he gave you a lil list of things to do
Said he wouldnt have to die he could live through you
Would you load your gats and get ready ro ride
Or would you lock the door at your crib and hide
Its a cold world even when its hot outside
Whether sunshine or rain you still feel pain
Hit him cause he was your strength
Now you in a daze
Your homie turnin over in his grave
Cause you pussy
Ya know who killed him
Ya know who killed him
Ya know who killed him
Ride
Ya know who killed him
Ya know who killed him
Ya know who killed him
Ride
Them boys smoked your homie
You aint gon do nothin back
Not even if he told you you next to get clapped
It dont take much for them shells to make the best of you
Your peoples probably gon cremate and burn the rest of you
You done did too much dirt to try and make it to heaven
Nigga is you down for this one eight seven
When you reach the pearly gates how you gon explain
You gonna try and tell God youve been framed
Yall did everything together he was your dog
Now you uptown coppin and he in the morgue
Them niggas he gave pacs to they kept the cake
His sister and baby momma talkin to Jake
Da niggas that rocked him they came to the wake
But they come inside they sat out in the ride
At the funeral homicide all in the business
Walkin round askin niggas to tell em who did it
Niggas is throwin blows now you ready to rumble
Thirsty niggas an animal the hood is a jungle
Broke nigga will body someone over a bundle
Man a three year old kid in my hood know what a gun do
Ya know who killed him
Ya know who killed him
Ya know who killed him
Ride
Ya know who killed him
Ya know who killed him
Ya know who killed him
Ride

Ya know who killed him
Ya know who killed him

Governor G-G-G-G-G-Unit
She aint that chick from the burbs thats a stranger to drama
She that Uptown Girl with the cock at the sauna
Went out her way to let her know that I want her
I told her I - know fo sho we belong together
And I wouldnt break her heart my intentions are better
And I shared the same dreams she had about cheddar
When the Ds came she was down to hold the Beretta
I got a thing for baby girls me and her against the world
Governor - singing
We used to think the same schemes with the same dreams in mind
tenll bring you back twenty if the crook is on time
And she knows daddy loves to eat
Take a seat and let my baby rub my feet
She was a clear thinker with a plan to rule the world
But understandin her place is my girl
Talk about hardcore to win shed give her life
Or shoot to kill to protect this life
The world will hear whats really goin on in my life - my life
The world will see what was really down down in my life - my life
If you only knew the pain I feel if you only could feel the streets is real
If they only knewwwwww whats goin onnnnnnn yeah
fifty Cent
Youre sunshine your smile make my day
Its simple - your dimple your eyes
Your lips your thighs got me hypnotized
Communications deep I love it when we talk
Hate it when you leave but when you leave I love to watch you walk
You make a nigga forget about a life full of drama
She got expensive taste she get it from her momma
Materialistic still a nigga want her
Consistently missin her touch when she gone uhh
She smell like Chanel she feelin me and I can tell
With the right woman by my side I feel like I cant fail
Ive been around been up and down my attitude is fuckin ass
She a rider Im in heaven when Im inside her
Workin up a sweat kissin on her neck twelve Play in the deck
Foplay correct have her drippin wet
She looked in my eyes and say she like it but I know she love it
I just keep doin what Im doin and think nuttin of it
abruptly ends halfway during the last line of the Chorus
STOPnonstop

She kiss it she suck it
She want me to want it

She want to climb up on it

Mmm yeah uhh
Mind playing tricks on me man
Its a regular day and a regular routine
Til I hear this tragic news from about two fiends
Your man fifty just got popped nine times
And I heard through the grapevines its all cause he rhymes
In front of his grandma Im standin on the lawn
Wearin no Teflon I wonder if he gone
I know in my heart I wanna cry
Havin thoughts in my mind is my man gon die
As I frantically run towards fifty spot
I panicky peep like fifty cops
It was blue whites DTs and homicide
With yellow tape locked off on both sides
With four-fifth shells on the floor
And DTs ringin doorbells goin door to door
Yo Im stressed out smokin bogie after bogie
Duckin the sarge cause the sarge fuckin know me
I jumped in Jeep truck and got a mac to spit
And we did about a buck cause Mary Mack I lit
at the time I started thinkin back some shit
How we used to sling crack and stack our chips
With Kev P-Low Big Jewel the Kid
And my man fifty used to smack a bitch
And the good and the bad on the one-three-four
And them hoes that we had on the Cash Money tour
Now Im at the hospital stop daydreamin
All I see is five-five-one and theres beefin
Baby moms is screamin whole family grievin
But the word is that my mans still breathin
I dropped to my knees and I thanked the Lord

Those that plot on me nine times outta ten the nine is on me
Feds search the god but nothin they find on me
When I rap dont wait to clap applaud sooner
Unless you hate a nigga like George Bush Jr I bring awkward to you
Porsche maneuvers through the city like new york sewers
Stinkin up the air central park horse manure
Rims is twenty-two inches Benz suspensions

Impotent you niggas get me sick wanna be soundin like

ChorusThis is how Im feeling right now I mean Im blessed
Me I aint got around doctor required
But nigger Im cleaner than your motherfucking preacher on Sunday morning
Me I run the streets so hard to get by
But better be the cleanest motherfucker in the surfs on Sunday morning
I made so many mistakes so many corrections Im so far from perfect so many imperfections
But Im a go gettaI get up and go get it so if youre preaching prosperity I wanna hate it
I make the hood look good turn base into base lines
punchlines to white lines and run for them one time
My verse is like a graphic scene close your eyes man you seen it dont feel
And you seen puff glow like theres no tomorrow
Hit that pass that thats the motto you know bills like they releasing from my friends
They gonna wake up tomorrow with the same shit again
You think Im bad man they dont give a fuck
Theyre trying to do what they gotta do to get it from
Me I aint got around doctor required
But nigger Im cleaner than your motherfucking preacher on Sunday morning
Me I run the streets so hard to get by
But better be the cleanest motherfucker in the surfs on Sunday morning
I take a line out the cookbook shoot me I shoot back I dont care if you die
First the sun comes down then the sun goes up
And the coke price too when the niggas make a buzz
Its freeze nigger get the fuck on the wall
Anything you work for they come and take it all
Man its like they dont know what theyre taking
Hit you with the tazer then you siting like a victim
When you pray say a prayer for me a nigger could use it
Before we pop up on that ass with toasters
Lord forgive me Im the rest of the game
Forgive me for that line and the rest of my sinsIf you think youre lonely now
Wait until tonight girl
Ah man
If you think youre lonely now
Wait until tonight girl
Im waitin on you to come baby Im that man
Bedroom superhero naked Im Batman
I kill it then I give ya mouth-to-mouth CPR
Bring ya back to life climax start your after life
Bounce up and down on my love this is chronic
Have it how you want it my back shots bionic
She givin me something I can feel like En Vogue
Unload then reload recharge Im back on
Back at it fuckin up the sprigs in her Craftmatic
Jack rabbit addiction I dont wanna break that habit
Your boy toy man child its cool you can play with me
City life bright lights tonight you can stay with me
I wanna share thoughts lets talk go for a walk
Fantasies we can get loose right in the park
Bullseye right through her head to her heart
Its mental and physical when youre gone Ill be missin you
You gon get it you gon get it
I got a plan for you Got it all planned girl
Girl its on til the mon when you come through ha ha
I cant think of a thing that I wont do What you wan do

Im Curtis Mayfield Marvin the new Bobby Womack
two thousand and twelve freak shit baby Im all that
The touchin and the teasin the pleasures the reason
Im sure shell be open from the lickin and strokin
Or how I say a line and it stimulates her mind
My sense of humor I make her smile while passin time
Its sexual its not perverted or obscene
The foreplay we play until I touch her til she cream
Cash rules the shortie shes something out a dream
Half J-Lo half Jessica Biel she in between
Got that island girl swag she Dutty Wine
When we get back to the spot that ass is mine
See how I switch gears her bra gone its on
Its showtime its my turn to perform
Leave the lights on while I get it I got it good
She sayin she love my show Im sayin I knew she wouldIntro

This time its gon take a whole SWAT team to bring me in
Im back on this shit again

Or how I say a line and it stimulates her mind
My sense of humor I make her smile while passin time
Its sexual its not perverted or obscene
The foreplay we play until I touch her til she cream
Cash rules the shortie shes something out a dream
Half J-Lo half Jessica Biel she in between
Got that island girl swag she Dutty Wine
When we get back to the spot that ass is mine
See how I switch gears her bra gone its on
Its showtime its my turn to perform
Leave the lights on while I get it I got it good
She sayin she love my show Im sayin I knew she wouldChorus

Ask Nas Kelis was the illest Ether

She aint even have to run to get away with the bread
Thats some fucked up shit
Think about that kid
Im thinking what this bitch thinking when she take me to court
I pay my child support what the fuck she want
This relationship shit its too much for me
I wanna fuck your friends and live comfortably
She wanna shine and blow minds on shopping sprees
She should have what she wants just not for me
Im thinking bout my future she part of my past
She dont care bout me she just want some cash
Im thinking damn girl we used to be friends
How did sh-t become all about ends

My knife flip open and then I gets to poking
Youre not really really ready
Them shells start popping and bodies get to dropping
Youre not really really ready
You think ya ready ya not
Really really readyThe rap game hip-hop one hundred and one
The hardest nine to five youll ever have
You cant remember shit in no history book
You ready to rap motherfucker
You ready to sell your soul hahaha
The rap game will fuck you up
Ima disrupted nigga you made me crazy
You shoulda slayed me as a baby
Behavin shadier than Wes Craven
And you aint even gotta pay me
I take pleasure of layin a nigga down daily
You face me punk its over youll faint fast
Ive never fucked up to where I cant whoop ya ass
Youll neckll get snapped with bare hands fuck music
Is he rappin Its cool but fools just dont confuse it
What happens these dudes get rude then I lose it
Im scandalous I blow ya two niggas off the atlas
With a gat thats bigger than Godzillas back nigga
You are not realer in fact youre feel the effects
Of a crack dealer whyall presidents since we smacked
And got a mack ten with it so I aint gotta rap
But Im thankful for that dont mistakin me black
Cause youll be stankin in the back of a fuckin Cadillac
Ima get snuffed cause I aint said enough to pipe down
I pipe down when the White House just wiped out
When I see that little Cheney dike get sniped out
Lights out bitch adios goodnight gunshot AHH
Now put that in ya little pipe and bite down
Think for a minute cause the hype just died down
That I wont go up in the Oval Office right now
And flip whatever aint tied down upside down
Im all for America fuck the government
Tell that seed to Laura tell the slut to suck a dick
Motherfuck ducked what the fuck son of a bitch
Take away my gun Im gonna tuck some other shit
Cant tell me shit about the tricks of this trade
Switchblade with a little switch to switch blades
And switch from a six to a sixteen inch blade
Shits like a samurai sword of Cincy
Shit just dont change to this day
Im this way still tell that utslay ipsbay
Upsay my ipnay scuse my ickpay addelay
But uckfay the rap game
Chorus
This rap game this rap game
I aint sellin my soul for this rap game
And I aint diggin no hole for this rap game
Man Im tellin you know it aint happening
This rap game this rap game
I aint sellin my soul for this rap game
I aint diggin no hole for this rap game
This rap game this rap game
I wouldnt want to be drinkin drowned in my own inequity
But fucked that Ima rap til whyall all get sick of me
And clutch my nuts sack and spit all who pick at me
Im pickin a rott mix fuck the dogs you sic on me
Im sayin you motherfuckers dont know us quit playin
If Im broke then Im breakin up in the place where you layin
You know same shit every nigga done in his life
I lived to this wise speak on when I want when I write
So why should I ever fear another man
If he bleed like I bleed take a piss and he stand
OK you win you can say we cant rap
But no shorts cause Im mean say this is whack
I walk in that party and just start bussin gunshots and screaming
Right after I hear the last verse of Self Destruction
This liquor makes me want to blast the chrome
To let you know the time without Morris Dangerome nigga
Im low down and shifty quickly call Swifty
To do a drive-by on the tenth speed with fifty
Ya feelin lucky Squeeze
I catch you outside of Chuckie Cheese
With ya seed you be an unlucky G
My lifestyle is unstable I party anatic
They said no fightin in the club so I brought me a matic
Coughin the static I jump niggas call me a rabbit
Poppin the tablet and guns to soften
Chorus
I snatch the chalk from the sidewalk and piss on the curb
This is absurd we street niggas twistin the words
We finally could Say Goodbye to Hollywood
cause Proof and Shyne man shit nothin in common
But ask this band with gasoline chan
We never bow down to be a flash in the pan
No remorse fuck ya stature dog
Nothin to do with hands when I clap at whyall
But to draw on the ground with the form and the pound
Then Im gone outta town fore the law come around
So we can battle with raps we can battle with gats
Matter of fact we can battle for plaques This rap game
Im too fuckin retarded
I dont give a fuck about my dick
Thats why Im datin Lorraina Bobbet
My crew had an argument who was the largest
Now they all is dead and I roll as a solo artist
Plus I made all the beats and wrote all the raps
Well I really didnt but I did accordin to this contract
I was thrown in the snow with nowhere to go
Freezin twenty below forced to join
My little girl she shouldnt listen to these lyrics
Thats why I glued her headphones to her ear to make sure she hear it
If rap dont work Im startin a group with Garth Brooks
Hahahaha and just say Look
ChorusTo all my fans above fifty Cent
Happy Valentines Dayfifty Cent
It aint good to good in front of niggas in the hood right

You can catch me in public housing wit bundles of D
Or in the Santa Monica mountains bundled up to ski
Since time is money I rhyme on the clock
And walk through the strip with a nine in the ox
You seen the ice you know its top notch
And when it comes to dice Im seeing shorty to the shot box
Banks stop guns pop through your tank top
And leave you wet up like a sonar range drop
When I grind I wear the same thing tomorrow
When you grind its Showtime at the Apollo
Damn near every rapper gotta hide sixteen
Well my flows like a ho thats sixteen
I ran through niggas dismantled niggas
They mad cause they see me in Cancun bitches
But Im ghetto straight from the hood my nigga
If theres no toothbrush Ima use my finger
I got so many minks and so many leathers
The crib is surrounded by animal protesters
Im a grown man still livin like Im young
With the mind of an old man full of wisdom
Here the cops come task force van
Rock so much ice Im called Jack Frost man
And while we sippin on cris you sippin backwash man
Your team got heart but your hearts in my hand
You want sixteen bars in song format
Or sixteen cars on your moms doormat whatGo go go go go go go shawty

From the last shootout I got a demple on my face

Shell hit my jaw I aint wait for doctor to get it out
Hit my wisdom tooth huck-too spit it out
I dont smile a lot cause aint nothin pretty
Got a purple heart for war and I aint never left the City
Hos be like Fitty you so witty

If you get shot and run to the cop - You not like me
You aint got no work on the block - You not like me
Its hot you aint got no drop - You not like me
Like me duke you not like me
Verse
Moma said
Everything that happened to us was part of Gods plan
So at night when I talk him I got my gun in my hand
Dont think Im crazy cause I dont fear man
Cause I feel when I kill a man God wont understand
I got a head full of evil thoughts am I Satan
I been coulda killed these niggaz Im still waitin
In the telly with to whores a Benz with to doors

You see me in the hood I got atleast two guns
I carry the glock Tony carry my M-ones
Hold me down nigga OGs tryin to rock me

This is my hustle nigga dont knock me
You need some shit with banana clips to try and stop me

If you get shot and run to the cop - You not like me
You aint got no work on the block - You not like me
Its hot you aint got no drop - You not like me

Verse
See I done been to the Pearly Gates they sent me back
The good die young I aint eligable for that
I shot niggaz I been shot sold crack in the street
My attitude is gangsta so I stand some beef
You wanna get acquainted with me you wanna know me
From three point range with a glock I shoot better then Kobe
See a nigga standin next to me he probably my Co-D
See a bitch gettin in my whip she probably gon blow me
See the flow is like a thirty-eight its special yoooooo
A country boy tell ya Im fittin to blowwwww
Im more like a pimp then a trick you knowwww
See Im in this for the paper I dont love the hooos
Niggaz broke in the hood worried about mines
Grown ass men wearin starter piece shines
You know them little pieces with the little stones
Got little clientele fiends call your cell phones
When the gossip starts Im always the topic
You too old for that shit dog why dont you stop it
Shorty I been watchin you watchin me
Now tell me what you like more my watch or me
Haha
If you get shot and run to the cop - You not like me
You aint got no work on the block - You not like me
Its hot you aint got no drop - You not like me
Like me duke you not like me
Ad-libing to the endHey Em you know you my favorite white boy right
I owe you for this one
Ive been patiently waiting for a track to explode on
You can stun if you want and your ass will get rolled on
It feels like my flows been hot for so long
If you thinking Im fucking fall off your so wrong
Innocent in my head like a baby born dead
Destination heaven sit and politic with passengers from nine eleven
The lords blessings leave me lyrically inclined
Shit I aint even gotta try to shine
Gods the seamstress that tailor fitted my pain
I got scriptures in my brain I could spit at your dame
Straight out the good book look niggas is shook
fifty fears no man warrior swing swords like Conan
Picture me pen in hand write lines knowing the sourcell quote it
When I die theyll read this and say a genius wrote it
I grew up without my pops should that make me bitter
I caught cases I copped out does that make me a quitter
In this white mans world Im similar to a squirrel
Lookin for a slut with a nice butt to get a nut
If I get shot today my phone will stop ringing again
These industry niggaz aint friends they know how to pretend
Patiently waiting to make it through all the hating
Debating whether or not you could even weather the storm
Just lay on the table they operating to save you
Its like an angel came to you sent from the heavens above
They think theyre crazy but they aint crazy lets face it shit basically
They just playing sick they aint shit They aint saying shit spray em Fifty
A to the K get in the way Ill bring Dre and them wit me
And turn this day into fucking mayhem you staying with me
Dont let me lose you Im not trying to confuse you
When I let loose with this Uzi and just shoot through your Isuzu
You get the message am I getting through to you
You know whats coming you motherfuckers dont even know do you
Take some Big and some Pac and you mix them up in a pot
Sprinkle a little Big L on top and what the fuck do you got
You got the realest and illest killers tied up in a knot
The Juggernauts of this rap shit like it or not
Its like a fight to the top just to see who died for the spot
You put your life in this nothing like surviving the shot
Yall know what time it is as soon as Fifty signs on this dot
Shit what you know about death threats cause I get a lot
Shady Records was eighty seconds away from the towers
Some cowards fucked with the wrong building they meant to hit ours
Better evacuate all children - nuclear shower
Theres nothing spookier youre now about to witness the power of fuckin Fifty
Ive been patiently waiting for a track to explode on
You can stun if you want and your ass will get rolled on
It feels like my flows been hot for so long
If you thinking Im fucking fall off your so wrong
Ive been patiently waiting for a track to explode on
You can stun if you want and your ass will get rolled on
It feels like my flows been hot for so long
If you thinking Im fucking fall off your so wrong
The guns spark when the shots go off
Its fifty they say its Fifty
See a nigga laid out with his fucking top blown off
Its fifty man that wasnt Fifty they dont holla my name
You shouldnt throw stones if you live in a glass house
And if you got a glass jaw you should watch your mouth
Cause Ill break your face have your ass running
Mumbling to the Jake you going against me dog you making a mistake
Ill split you have you looking like the Michael Jacksons jackets with all them zippers
Im the boss on this boat you can call me skipper
The way I turn the money over you should call me flipper
Your bitch a regular bitch you calling her wifey
I fucked her I feed her fast food you keeping her icy
Im down to sell records but not my soul
Snoop said this in ninety-four We dont love them hoes
I got pennies for my thoughts now Im rich
See the twentys spinning looking mean on the six
Niggas wearing flags cause the colors match they clothes
They get caught in the wrong hood and get filled up with holes motherfucker
Ive been patiently waiting for a track to explode on
You can stun if you want and your ass will get rolled on
It feels like my flows been hot for so long
If you thinking Im fucking fall off your so wrong
Ive been patiently waiting for a track to explode on
You can stun if you want and your ass will get rolled on
It feels like my flows been hot for so long
If you thinking Im fucking fall off your so wrong

To send a mothafucka at you tonight
G-Unit and I aint stoppin to my clique poppin
Swimmin in barrels of money

Im pullin your mask off as soon as you act up
You know what I came for it isnt the game ball

Lloyd Banks
Im wide awake but it still feels like Im dreamin
Forty Cal under my pillow condom feelin my semen
The physical presence of a female form of a demon
Thats why I fuck em and leave em
Get my nut while Im breathin
Cause they thought theyd catch me slippin
Now Im duckin and trippin
Thats a thousand dollar outfit what the fuck is you rippin
You trippin more records could get my ass in position
Death wish for no religion whether Catholic or Christian
Listen I went through mama bitchin in and out the kitchen
With probable cause papa was in and out of prison
You got soldiers but you still gotta respect ours
We got more four fives and nines than a deck of cards
You can take me out the hood but cant take the hood out me
Cause what
Cause Im ghetto Im ghetto
Niggaz hate when you do good
But when you broke your friends and your enemies
They love you they love you
Chi Chi get the llello
Picture me being crack out of town trips on the trail
Chi Chi get the llello
Picture me being crack
Tony Yayo
You can sift me cut me Ill turn you to a junkie

Wallstreet niggaz they cop me on the low
White boys dont call me coke they call me blow
Its time to go on the bus the train the plane
Ill smuggle Im nothin but trouble
Ill make your money double
Cook me in baking soda
Ill turn your Hooprock into a new Range Rover
Ill pay all your bills and fill your frigerator
Feed your family turn your man to a hater
Put me in your doorpanels or your stashbox
Put me in your Niks Timbs or Reeboks
If you cop three and a half you hustlin backwards
Cop a hundred grams
You movin forwards
You tryin to move more birds
In PA all day on the corner of Third
You can take me out the hood
But cant take the hood out me

You know my contestants
As the world turns theres lessons to be learned
Count all my blessins clean up my weapons

Belagio twenty grand in chips at a dice game
Burn out cant stop gotta watch MTV BET
Nigga you see me

Gotta make it to heaven I hope I make it to heaven
Some say Im paranoid I say Im careful how I choose my friends
Been to ICU once I aint going again
First Zee got murked then Raw got murked
An homies still in the hood why he aint getting hurt
I smell somethin fishy man it might be a rat
Damn niggas switching sides on niggas just like that
You know me I stay wit a bitch on her knees
An get guns away in the hood like government cheese
Spray on Suzukis eleven hundred ccs
More plate on the back straight squeezing a Mak
In the hood they identify niggas by they cars
So I switch up whips to stay off the radar
I aint gotta be around to make shit hot
I send Yayo to dump thirty shots on ya block
So spray that Tec nigga if I say get it done
An make it wet niggas if you round me son
I gotta make it to heaven for going through hell
Gotta make it to heaven gotta make it to heaven

Gotta make it to heaven I hope I make it to heaven
I gotta make it to heaven for going through hell
Gotta make it to heaven gotta make it to heaven

When I come through the hood I dont stop the rapping niggaz
Get close enough to smack get it clapping nigga
Pac tried to front so I waved the chrome on his ass
Point blank range I span put a bone on his ass
Two weeks later niggas came through with Maks to lay me down
Then sprayed I played dead and got the fuck off the ground
Out the blue I get a phone call fifty what up
You send a bitch at me I send the bitch back cut up
I dont play that pussy shit I done told you boy
Front on me you gon meet one of my soldiers boy
Cause Entwain shot up his mamma crib an now he in Jail
Trippin on Fliks an bogger trail pussy in black tail
Pack mamma moved but she dont talk to him no more
The shells from twains four-four blew the hinge off her do
Without that Tec every month how she gon pay for the crib
Man social service finis come and take them kids
I gotta make it to heaven for going through hell
Gotta make it to heaven gotta make it to heaven
I gotta make it to heaven for going through hell
Gotta make it to heaven I hope I make it to heaven
I gotta make it to heaven for going through hell
Gotta make it to heaven gotta make it to heaven
I gotta make it to heaven for going through hell
Gotta make it to heaven I hope I make it to heaven
Lord grant me the serenity to accept the things I can not change the courage
To change the things I can but wisdom to know the difference
But A Ade did a make you say that I say that
Thats the credit put in your head when you a case act
Man I might talk to you while we up in the Penz
But when we come home that dont mean we goin fuck an be friends
Shells smash ya head close enough to hear em whistling
Thank god they missed you an go grab ya pistol
In the hood niggas running round acting crazy
Buying little air Jordans for maybe babies
See it might be his an it might be yours
Cause them broads in the projects is straight up whores
Man it dont take much for you to get in them draws
You aint can have em on they back or on all fours
You got to tell me you feeling this shit
Because I hear what Im saying I know Im killing this shit

Gotta make it to heaven gotta make it to heaven
I gotta make it to heaven for going through hell
Gotta make it to heaven I hope I make it to heaven

Gotta make it to heaven I hope I make it to heavenYea
Lets takeem back
Uh huh
Coming up I was confused
My mama kissing a girl
Confusion occurs
Coming up in a cold world
Daddy aint around
Probably out committing felonies
My favorite rapper used to sing
Check check out my melody
I wanna live good so shit I sell dope
For a four-finger ring
One of them gold ropes
Nana told me if I passed I get a sheep skin coat
If I could move a few packs
I get the hat
Now thatll be dope
Tossed and turn in my sleep that night
Woke up the next morning
Niggaz done stole my bike
Different day same shit
Aint nothing good in the hood
I run away from this bitch
And never come back if I could

Ten gz will take your daughter outta air forces
Believe you me homie I know all about losses
Im from Compton where the wrong colors be cautious
One phone call have your body dumped in Marcy
I stay strapped like car seats
Been banging since ma lil nigga rob got killed for his Barkleys
Thats ten years
I told Pooh in ninety-five
Ill kill you if you try me for my air-max ninety-fives
Told Banks when I metem Im a ride
And if I gotta die rather homicide
I aint had fifty cent when ma grand-mama died
Now Im going back to Cali with ma jacob on
See how time fly

And Im gon shine homie until my heart stop
The Game
Goheadn envy me
Im raps MVP
And I aint going no where
So you can get to know me
fifty Cent
From the beginning to the end
Losers lose winners win
This is real we aint gotta pretend
The cold world that we in
Its full of pressure and pain
Enough of me nigga now listen to Game
Game
Used to see five-zero throw the crack by the bench
Now Im fucking with five-zero its all starting to make sense
My Mas happy she aint gotta pay the rent
And she got a red bow on that brand new Benz
Waiting on Sha Money to land sitting in the range
Thinking how they spend thirty million dollars on airplanes
When theres kids starving
Pac is gone and Brenda still throwing babies in the garbage
I wanna know whats going on like I hear Marvin
No school books
They use their wood to build coffins
Whenever Im in a booth
And I get exhausted
I think what if Marie Baker got that abortion
I love you Ma
Chorus
fifty Cent
Hate it or love it the under dogs on top
And Im gon shine homie until my heart stop
The Game
Goheadn envy me
Im raps MVP
And I aint going no where
So you can get to know meI need you to pray for me and
I need you to care for me and
I need you to want me to win
I need to know where Im heading cause I know where Ive been
The flow is bone crushing its nothing I come up with something
Come through your strip fronting stunting
Its something you want seven hundred and forty-five chrome spinners
Haters hate that Im winning
Man Ive been hot from the beginning
Motherfuckers envy the kid control your jealousy
Cause I cant control my temper Im finna catch a felony
Pistol in hand homie Im down to get it popping
Once I squeeze the first shot you know I aint stopping
Till my clip is empty Im simply
Not that nigga you should try your luck with or fuck with
Hollow-tip shells struck you with your bones broken guns smoking still locing
What nigga lay your ass down paramedics get you up feeling
Right now Im on the edge so dont push me
I aim straight for your head so dont push me
Fill your ass up with leadso dont push me
I got something for your ass keep thinking Im pussy
Right now Im on the edge so dont push me
I aim straight for your head so dont push me
Fill your ass up with leadso dont push me
I got something for your ass keep thinking Im pussy
I done lost my bigger nigga and I didnt cry
To young to understand the consequences of a man
Living a lie I gotta get that money
Ill be damned if Im bummy
Gotta watch my back around these niggas cause they funny
twenty years of watching my mamas tears got my heated heavily weeded
Smoking that bong cause I need it
These niggas dont want me balling they want me buried
Bogged in the dirt from shots flurried
Laying with bugs under my shirt
I got plans to hop up in that Hummer
Cause Im a stunner I sit back and wonder
When them angels gonna call my number under
My chest is a heart of a lion
I aint lying bounty hunters got me flying
With my iron high as a giant
Im running from nothing my stomach is touching what Im clutching
To give you more than a concussion end of discussion
My blood is colder so Im bolder
Hennessy and soda hood on my shoulder
Look in the mirror I see a soldier
Right now Im on the edge so dont push me
I aim straight for your head so dont push me
Fill your ass up with leadso dont push me
I got something for your ass keep thinking Im pussy
Right now Im on the edge so dont push me
I aim straight for your head so dont push me
Fill your ass up with leadso dont push me
I got something for your ass keep thinking Im pussy
These are my ideas this is my sweat and tears
This is shit that I saw with my eyeballs my ears
This is me whos gotta be what you see on TV
What you hear on CD what appears easy
Man these teenie boppers see me on these magazine covers
In these beanies and these rags living fantasies
Fronting like its all fun and games til the shoot em up bang
And you see your brains hang and you see we aint playing
Aint saying we aint laying down at night and aint praying
I bullied my way in this game man Im done playing
Man Im done saying that Im done playing
Imma start laying into these motherfucking cocksuckers
Theres no way Im back down like a god damn coward
I cant how would I look as a man bowing to his knees
Like the mad cow disease let somebody lash out at me
And not lash back out at em please
Oh whoa yo ho hold up oh no not me not Marshall
You wanna see Marshall Ill show you Marshall
I try to show you art but you just pick it apart
So I see I have to start showing you fucking old farts
A whole other side I wanted to not show you
So you know youre not dealing with some fucking marshmallow
Little soft yellow punk pussy whose hearts Jello cause
Right now Im on the edge so dont push me
I aim straight for your head so dont push me
Fill your ass up with leadso dont push me
I got something for your ass keep thinking Im pussy
Right now Im on the edge so dont push me
I aim straight for your head so dont push me
Fill your ass up with leadso dont push me
I got something for your ass keep thinking Im pussy
Shady Aftermath nigga G-Unit

The drama really means nothing to me
Ill ride by and blow ya brains out
Theres no time to cock it no way you can stop it
When niggas run up on you with them thangs out

The DA can play this motherfucking tape in court

I aint playing hear what Im saying homie I aint playing
Catch you slipping Imma kill you
I aint playing hear what Im saying homie I aint playing
Keep thinking Im candy till ya fucking skull get popped
And ya brain jump out the top like Jack-in-the-box
In the hood summer time is the killing season
Its hot out this bitch thats a good enough reason
Ive seen gangstas get religious when they start bleeding
Saying Lord Jesus help me cause they ass leaking
When they window roll down and that AK come out
You can squeeze ya little handgun until you run out
And you can run for ya backup
But them machine gun shells gone tear ya back up
Gods on ya side Shit Im aight with that
Cause we gon reload them clips and come right back
Its a fact homie you go against me ya fucked
I get the drop if you can duck ya luckier then Lady Luck

And let ya ass look for me
If theres beef cock it and dump it
The drama really means nothing to me

I aint playing hear what Im saying homie I aint playing
Catch you slipping Imma kill you
I aint playing hear what Im saying homie I aint playing
My heart bleeds for you nigga I cant wait to get to you
Behind that twinkle in ya eyes I can see the bitch in you
Nigga you know the streets talk
So theyll be no white flags and no peace talks
I got my back against the wind Im down to ride till the sun burn out
If I die today Im happy how my life turned out
See the shootouts that Ive been in Im by myself
Locked up I was in a box by myself
I done made myself a millionaire by myself
Now shit changed motherfucker I can hire some help
I done heard about the fifty grand you put in the hood
But ya shooter finnin to get shot it wont do him no good
With a pistol I define the definition of pain
If you survive ya bonesll still fucking hurt when it rain
Oh you a pro at playing battleship Well this aint the same
Little homie this is a whole different type of war game
See the losers end up in shackles and motherfucking chains
Or laid out in the streets leaking out they brains
If theres beef cock it and dump it
The drama really means nothing to me
Ill ride by and blow ya brains out
Theres no time to cock it no way you can stop it
When niggas run up on you with them thangs out
I do what I gotta do I dont care I if get caught
The DA can play this motherfucking tape in court
Ill kill you
I aint playing hear what Im saying homie I aint playing
Catch you slipping Imma kill you
I aint playing hear what Im saying homie I aint playing
After the fist fights its gunfire boy you get the best of me
If you dont wanna get shot I suggest you dont go testing me
All the wrong Ive done the Lord still keep on blessing me
Finnin to run rap cause Dr Dre got the recipeGo go go go go go go shawty

We gon sip Bacardi like its your birthday
And you know we dont give a fuck

But homie aint nothing change hold down Gs up

If you watch how I move youll mistake me for a player or pimp
Been hit wit a few shells but I dont walk wit a limp
In the hood then the ladies saying fifty you hot
They like me I want them to love me like they love Pac
But holla in New York them niggasll tell ya Im loco
And the plan is to put the rap game in a choke hold

And you should love it way more then you hate it
Nigga you mad I thought that youd be happy I made it
Im that cat by the bar toasting to the good life
You that fagot ass nigga trying to pull me back right
When my junk get to pumping in the club its on

If the roof on fire let the motherfucker burn
If you talking bout money homie I aint concerned

You dont see me in the hood its cause Im doing this man
Niggas Im still grinding yeah I still hearing those sirens
Im still getting chased by those lights
Only the lights lime and my mics on
And my time is none because Im writing more
I dont hear to meet a soul in this business
Im here to eat speak until these hos feel this
I aint gonna let you derail me man
I got Young Kobe homey you gotta let go of Obie
Cause Obie be back going nowhere man we got them craps going on
And that yak going on soon as a nigga touch down back from town
Its forever put that on the cheddar man
But in the meantime its Jimmy Iovine time
Chase cheese rhyme til my voice give out
This is it my niggas this what we boast about
Now Im here so shut your motherfucking mouth and show me love bitch
Chorus
I just want to love for the rest of my life I dont love you bitch
I want to hold you in the morn hold you thorough the night
Right we want to love alcohol we want to love guns we want to love money
we dont love no bitches though
I just want to love for the rest of my life
I want to hold you in the morn hold you in the night
Eminem
Theres a certain mystique when I speak that you notice
Cause its sort of unique cause you know its me
My poetrys deep and Im still-matic the way I flow to this beat
You cant sit still its like trying to smoke crack and go to sleep
Im strapped its known any minute I could snap
Im the equivalent of what would happen if Bush rapped
I bully these rappers so bad lyrically
It aint even funny I aint even hungry it aint even money
You cant pay me enough for you to play me
Its cockamamie you just aint zany enough to rock with Shady
My noodle is cock-a-doodle my clocks coo-coo
I got screws loose yea the whole kit and caboodle Im just brutal
Its no rumor Im numero uno assume it theres no more humor in it you know
Im rolling with a swollen bowling ball in my bag
You need a fag and tear a new hole in my ass you better love me bitch
Chorus
fifty Cent
My buzz is crazy in the hood they holla my name
If it aint about the flow its bout the stones and the chain
If I was you Id love men too I roll like a boss
Nine eleven Porsche same color as cranberry sauce
I aint gon front I thought R Kelly was the shit
Let me find out he fucking round with Bow Wow bitch
Niggas eating popcorn right rewinding the tape
Now shorty mama in the precinct hollering rape
Im convinced man something really wrong with these hos
I thought Lil Kim was hot til she start fucking with her nose
I used to listen to Lauryn Hill and tap my feet
Then the bitch put out a CD and didnt have no beats
That nigga DAngelo he determined not to fail
That nigga went butt-ass for his record to sell
My back shot to help Ashanti hit them high notes
And Big Ben taught Charlie B More to deep throat yea
Chorus
fifty Cent
I love the burners the money the bunnies I just want to hold you ha ha
I just want to love you yeaMan we gotta go get something to eat man
Im hungry as a motherfucker
Hey yo man damn whats taking homie so long son
fifty calm down here he come
What the fuck
Son pull up pull up
Many men wish death upon me
Blood in my eye dog and I cant see
Im trying to be what Im destined to be
And niggas trying to take my life away
I put a hole in nigga for fucking with me
My back on the wall now you gon see
Better watch how you talk when you talk about me
Cause Ill come and take your life away
Many men many many many many men
Wish death pon me
Lord I dont cry no more
Dont look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me
Now these pussy niggas putting money on my head
Go on and get your refund motherfucker I aint dead
Im the diamond in the dirt that aint been found
Im the underground king and I aint been crowned
When I rhyme something special happen every time
Im the greatest something like Ali in his prime
I walk the block with the bundles
Ive been knocked on the humble
Swing the ox when I rumble
Show your ass what my gun do
Got a temper nigga go head lose your head
Turn your back on me get clapped and lose your legs
I walk around gun on waist chip on my shoulder
Till I bust a clip in your face pussy this beef aint over
Many men many many many many men
Wish death pon me
Lord I dont cry no more
Dont look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me
Have mercy on my soul
Somewhere my heart turned cold
Have mercy on many men
Many many many many men
Wish death upon me
Sunny days wouldnt be special if it wasnt for rain
Joy wouldnt feel so good if it wasnt for pain
Death gotta be easy cause life is hard
Itll leave you physically mentally and emotionally scarred
This if for my niggas on the block twisting trees and cigars
For the niggas on lock doing life behind bars
I dont see only god can judge me cause I see things clear
Quick these crackers will give my black ass a hundred years
Im like Paulie in Goodfellas you can call me the Don
Like Malcolm by any means with my gun in my palm
Slim switched sides on me let niggas ride on me
I thought we was cool why you want me to die homie
Many men many many many many men
Wish death pon me
Lord I dont cry no more
Dont look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me
Have mercy on my soul
Somewhere my heart turned cold
Have mercy on many men
Many many many many men
Wish death upon me
Every night I talk to god but he dont say nothing back
I know he protecting me but I still stay with my gat
In my nightmares niggas keep pulling techs on me
Psych says some bitch dumb put a hex on me
The feds didnt know much when Pac got shot
I got a kite from the pens that told me Tuck got knocked
I aint gonna spell it out for you motherfuckers all the time
Are you illiterate nigga You cant read between the lines
In the bible it says what goes around comes around
Almost shot me three weeks later he got shot down
Now its clear that Im here for a real reason
Cause he got hit like I got hit but he aint fucking breathing
Many men many many many many men
Wish death pon me
Lord I dont cry no more
Dont look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me
Have mercy on my soul
Somewhere my heart turned cold
Have mercy on many men
Many many many many men
Wish death upon meHey Em you know you my favorite white boy right
I owe you for this one
Ive been patiently waiting for a track to explode on
You can stun if you want and your ass will get rolled on
It feels like my flows been hot for so long
If you thinking Im fucking fall off your so wrong
Innocent in my head like a baby born dead
Destination heaven sit and politic with passengers from nine eleven
The lords blessings leave me lyrically inclined
Shit I aint even gotta try to shine
Gods the seamstress that tailor fitted my pain
I got scriptures in my brain I could spit at your dame
Straight out the good book look niggas is shook
fifty fears no man warrior swing swords like Conan
Picture me pen in hand write lines knowing the sourcell quote it
When I die theyll read this and say a genius wrote it
I grew up without my pops should that make me bitter
I caught cases I copped out does that make me a quitter
In this white mans world Im similar to a squirrel
Lookin for a slut with a nice butt to get a nut
If I get shot today my phone will stop ringing again
These industry niggaz aint friends they know how to pretend
Patiently waiting to make it through all the hating
Debating whether or not you could even weather the storm
Just lay on the table they operating to save you
Its like an angel came to you sent from the heavens above
They think theyre crazy but they aint crazy lets face it shit basically
They just playing sick they aint shit They aint saying shit spray em Fifty
A to the K get in the way Ill bring Dre and them wit me
And turn this day into fucking mayhem you staying with me
Dont let me lose you Im not trying to confuse you
When I let loose with this Uzi and just shoot through your Isuzu
You get the message am I getting through to you
You know whats coming you motherfuckers dont even know do you
Take some Big and some Pac and you mix them up in a pot
Sprinkle a little Big L on top and what the fuck do you got
You got the realest and illest killers tied up in a knot
The Juggernauts of this rap shit like it or not
Its like a fight to the top just to see who died for the spot
You put your life in this nothing like surviving the shot
Yall know what time it is as soon as Fifty signs on this dot
Shit what you know about death threats cause I get a lot
Shady Records was eighty seconds away from the towers
Some cowards fucked with the wrong building they meant to hit ours
Better evacuate all children - nuclear shower
Theres nothing spookier youre now about to witness the power of fuckin Fifty
Ive been patiently waiting for a track to explode on
You can stun if you want and your ass will get rolled on
It feels like my flows been hot for so long
If you thinking Im fucking fall off your so wrong
Ive been patiently waiting for a track to explode on
You can stun if you want and your ass will get rolled on
It feels like my flows been hot for so long
If you thinking Im fucking fall off your so wrong
The guns spark when the shots go off
Its fifty they say its Fifty
See a nigga laid out with his fucking top blown off
Its fifty man that wasnt Fifty they dont holla my name
You shouldnt throw stones if you live in a glass house
And if you got a glass jaw you should watch your mouth
Cause Ill break your face have your ass running
Mumbling to the Jake you going against me dog you making a mistake
Ill split you have you looking like the Michael Jacksons jackets with all them zippers
Im the boss on this boat you can call me skipper
The way I turn the money over you should call me flipper
Your bitch a regular bitch you calling her wifey
I fucked her I feed her fast food you keeping her icy
Im down to sell records but not my soul
Snoop said this in ninety-four We dont love them hoes
I got pennies for my thoughts now Im rich
See the twentys spinning looking mean on the six
Niggas wearing flags cause the colors match they clothes
They get caught in the wrong hood and get filled up with holes motherfucker
Ive been patiently waiting for a track to explode on
You can stun if you want and your ass will get rolled on
It feels like my flows been hot for so long
If you thinking Im fucking fall off your so wrong
Ive been patiently waiting for a track to explode on
You can stun if you want and your ass will get rolled on
It feels like my flows been hot for so long
If you thinking Im fucking fall off your so wrong

All money aint good money this I know

And as a youngster a n went to so much church
And still turned out fed up I did so much dirt
Chose to bang the neighborhood I put in so much work
Did a whole lot of time caused mom so much hurt
On every thang that boy wasnt gunned on purpose
Who knew that all my darkness was really gon surface
I was stuck on that bulls just runnin the streets
Without some type of beef the week wasnt complete
Its like a n feel better after dumpin his heat
On feet just to see that body slumped in the seat
Was like a whole nother rush to me bustin was sweet

Im on the road spend thirty days a month in a suite

Some of the levels that these peoplell go to for crumbs
Damn tell me is this what that dough do
Thats when you find yourself talkin to Pro Tools
Theres not too many that ever walked in the Loc shoes
Or tell the tale that my heart contains
I explain so many different parts of pain
Im clean but still some marks remain
From the past when that kush weed sparks the brain
The cash made some people start to change
I feel hate when I pulled up and parked the Range
Your damn right I got rich but my heart the same
And practice makes perfect with the art of aim
You aint really got the heart to bang
You aint start to hang til you found out I caught the chain

Lloyd Banks
Still walk around wit the hammer boss
Rope and a cross
Hard timesll make a lil nigga hate Santa Claus
Your mountains is high holdin in Diana Ross
Im like a two thousand and three banana Porsche
I dont gotta hide sluts to get your ties cut
They on my dick cause I make groupies set off a fire truck
My team in the cutt packin middle things
I got more foreign shooters than the Sacramento Kings
Its eight class karats in the border
I poke holes in plastic to avoid a vaginal disorder
Im a savage on your daughter
She aint in the college dorm
Then I guess Im squirtin on the cabin that you bought her
Im a heavy weed smoker so the average is a quarter
Brown colored from shit he established in the water
You got Banks on your jersey you part of my fan base
Just cause you pour syrup on shit dont make it pancakes
ChorusYeah this somethin special whyknow somethin epic
Lloyd Banks you know
Cause a nigga thuggin dont mean he dont
Dont wanna see you smile baby
I wanna be the reason you smile
I wanna be the reason you smile
I wanna be the reason you smile
After you wipe away your tears and dry your eyes
Im gettin the feelin you wanna take revenge
From the conversations we have and the way it ends
You wanna discuss me in front of your lady friends
Thats why its just me and my Mercedes Benz
It all depends maybe if we make amends
We can start from scratch
Learn to control your temper and remarks in fact
We plan to be platonic with our hearts in tact
So every time we separate somebodys marchin back
Youre amazing in the sack eyes slanted like youre Asian
But youre black God bless whoever gave you alla that
If you seen her from the back youd understand why dis feel like that
And aint a flaw to her toes the Lord knows
Her pussy good enough to miss award shows
And I aint gotta say nothin she just knows
By the way I look at her to take off all her clothes up and down
Whenever Im not around and you feelin down
Let the thought of me be
I wanna be the reason you smile
I dont wanna see you frown like them kids watch a clown
I wanna bring you joy and be
I wanna be the reason you smile
Baby you know my style you know how I get down
I provide by any means to be
I wanna be the reason you smile
We done been through ups and downs had drama for a while
Im just happy Im around to be
I wanna be the reason you smile
The main reason I been lookin at you pitiful
What about the half of this shit I done did to you
Violated and tiptoed into a crib or two
Ive come clean to be a bigger individual
Even though youre busy boo the evenings when I visit you
Kinda makes me feel lucky cause I see niggaz
When you tease em with your physical
She wanna rack up her brooms I aint got no more room left
Wild drama section eight princess
My foreign chick bad but she been stressed
Cause its hard to communicate
Cause she dont speak-a no English
I been around the world from state to state
But now Im back bustin in your bathroom
Got you laughin in your shower cap
Lets get it on
Cause Im leavin in a hour fly-through
Dont matter shes mad even when I holla back
All I really need your attention for a while
And I bet you I can make you smile
Whenever Im not around and you feelin down
Let the thought of me be
I wanna be the reason you smile
I dont wanna see you frown like them kids watch a clown
I wanna bring you joy and be
I wanna be the reason you smile
Baby you know my style you know how I get down
I provide by any means to be

First shot pop off everybody popping shots
The glass at the store front we forgot God was watching
Run run hit the gate Ds yelling drop it
Niggas getting jammed up better that than a jammed up
His momma said a few words to her he was innocent

Im from that city full of yellow cabs and skyscrapers
Its hard to get a start in these parts without paper
Homie I grew up in hell a block away from heaven
That corner every fifteen minutes it move a seven
Pure snow bag it then watch it go
Occupational options get some blow or some hoes
Shoot the bowl or the strap learn to rap or to jack
Fuck it man in the mean time go ahead and pump a pack
This my regal royal flow my James Bond bounce
That seven that sixty-two on my count
Im a undercover liar I lie under the covers
Look a bitch in the eyes and tell her baby I love it
Youre my inspiration youre my motivation
Youre the reason that Im moving with no hesitation
They say this is a big rich town
I just come from the poorest part
Bright lights city life I gotta make it
This is where it goes down
I just happen to come up hard
Legal or illegal baby I gotta make it
I gotta hustle through the hustle and bust while I make a move
Manuever around the rats and wolves Im from the school
Of hard knocks shots pop bodies drop
Graveyard pick a plot cause niggas want your spots
Im trying to stack shit then I go legit
Hollow tip stuff em in a clip case niggas trip
My cocaine endeavours give me corporate ties
Im supposed to lose watch me win against the odds
All I got is my word balls and my instinct
Im trying to make it we already made it my friends think
We already on top I got a bigger plan
No more controlled substances or hand to hand
White collar visions game changing mission
Big risks big wins equal bigger living
Perfect position watch me transition
From caterpillar to butterfly in the skyNigga you pussy you scared
I can hear your heartbeat
Why the fuck would you come around here
I can hear your heartbeat
Yeah you know a dog sense fear
I can hear your heartbeat
You bark while we bite around here
I can hear your heartbeat
We aint cut from the same cloth we into different shit
I want the bread you want the bitch
Come out your mouth slick Ill get you hit
My niggas hungry they hit a lick
Fuck who youre with niggasll dump a clip
We by the school yard waiting for you to get your kid
I caught a Aone felony on my last bid
Kept calm made bond Im on that shit
You think my rap shit a gimmick I aint seen parole in a minute
Truth be told these niggas is hoes
Once the shit set off man anything goes
Through the windows of your soul the eyes never lie
If you aint scared to die nigga why would you cry
Nigga you pussy you scared
I can hear your heartbeat
Why the fuck would you come around here
I can hear your heartbeat
Yeah you know a dog sense fear
I can hear your heartbeat
You bark while we bite around here
I can hear your heartbeat
thirty something and you aint even open your mouth yet
Social media is giving cowards an outlet
See him in person say something I doubt that
Rather get caught with it than get caught without that
Trying to back peddle and stumble on the curve
You starin at the ground you mumblin your words
Literally I can see your heart pumpin through your shirt
Pussy your whole life you always been a bird
Scared for so long its all up in your nerves
Screw nine-one-one you probably call up the reserves
And Im killin you first if we ever do a purge
And you know what it is kid whenever we emerge
And Im tragical traumatical no match incompatible
Nigga you vaginal
Nigga you pussy you scared
I can hear your heartbeat
Why the fuck would you come around here
I can hear your heartbeat
Yeah you know a dog sense fear
I can hear your heartbeat
You bark while we bite around here
I can hear your heartbeat
Money for bail money to bail
Dead or in jail Heaven or Hell
FEDs on my coat tail snitches given court tells
Kept fate when all hope fail
Niggas rattin all they missin is the tail like Mickey Mouse
Call me Mickey Mantle when I bat you in the mouth
I bring them hammers out we aint trying to build a house
Niggas on them songs rappin shit they aint about
Im from the N-O we dont scrap we bang it out
Bang Im the one that came in your house for the chickens
Left a nigga brains hangin out like we chillin
Stankin like shipments over my shillings
Hump your security Rida gang in the building
Nigga you pussy you scared
I can hear your heartbeat
Why the fuck would you come around here
I can hear your heartbeat
Yeah you know a dog sense fear
I can hear your heartbeat
You bark while we bite around here
I can hear your heartbeatHook fifty Cent

You da fuckin best you da fuckin best
You the da best I ever had
Best I ever had best I ever had best I ever had

Sex love pain baby I be on that tank shit
Buzz so big I could probably sell a blank disk
When my album drop bitches will buy it for the picture
And niggas will buy two and claim they got it for they sister
Magazine paper girl but money aint the issue
They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial
She call me the referee cause I be so official
My shirt aint got no stripes but I can make your pussy whistle
Like the Andy Griffith theme song
And who told you to put them jeans on
Double cup love youre the one I lean on
Feeling for a fix than you should really get your fiend on
Yeah just know my condo is the crack spot
Every single show she out there reppin like a mascot
Get it from the back and make ya fuckin bra strap pop
All up in your slot till a nigga hit the jack pot
Baby youre my everything youre all I ever wanted
We could do it real big bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything other hoes aint never on it
I want this forever I swear I could spend whatever on it

Uh ah yeah
See this the type of joint you gotta dedicate to somebody

Young money yeah yeah
You know who you are I got youIt may not mean nothing to yall
But understand nothing was done for me
So I dont plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever mayne ever mayne ever mayne
Im shutting shit down at the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I aint even planning to call
I want this shit forever mayne ever mayne ever mayne
Last name ever
First name greatest
Like a sprained ankle boy aint nothing to play with
It started off local but thanks to all the haters
I know Gfour pilots on a first name basis
In your city faded off the brown Nino
She insists she got more class we know
Swimming in the money come and find me Nemo
If I was at the club you know I balled chemo
Dropped the mixtape that shit sounded like an album
Whod have thought a country wide tour would be the outcome
Labels want my name beside the X like Malcolm
Everybody got a deal I did it without one
Yeah nigga Im about my business
Killing all these rappers you would swear I had a hit list
Everyone who doubted me is asking for forgiveness
If you aint been a part of it at least you got to witness
Bitches
It may not mean nothing to yall
But understand nothing was done for me
So I dont plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever mayne ever mayne ever mayne
Im shutting shit down at the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I aint even planning to call
I want this shit forever mayne ever mayne ever mayne
Forever ever Mr West is in da building
Aint no question who about to kill em
I used to have hood dreams
Big fame big chains
I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came
I went hard all fall like the ball teams
Just so I can make it rain all spring
Yall seen my story my glory
I had raped the game young
You can call it statutory
When a nigga blow up they can build statures of me
Old money Benjamin Button what nothin
Now superbad chicks giving me McLovin
You would think I ran the world like Michelles husband
You would think these niggas would know me when they really doesnt
Like they was down with the old me no you fucking wasnt
Youre such a fucking loser
He didnt even go to class Bueller
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back
Remember she had that bad hip like a fanny pack
Chasing that stardom would turn you into a maniac
All the way in Hollywood and I cant even act
They pull their cameras out and God damn they snap
I used to want this thing forever yall can have it back
It may not mean nothing to yall
But understand nothing was done for me
So I dont plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever mayne ever mayne ever mayne
Im shutting shit down at the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I aint even planning to call
I want this shit forever mayne ever mayne ever mayne
OK hello its the martian Space Jam Jordans
I want this shit forever wake up and smell the Garden
Fresher than the harvest
Step up to the target
If I had one guess than I guess Im just New Orleans
And I will never stop like Im running from the cops
Hopped up in my car and told my chauffeur to the top
Life is such a fucking roller coaster then it drops
But what should I scream for this is my theme park
My minds shine even when my thoughts seem dark
Pistol on my side you dont wanna hear that thing talk
Let the king talk check the price and pay attention
Lil Wayne thats what they got to say or mention
Im like Nevada in the middle of the summer
Im resting in the lead I need a pillow and a cover
Shh my foots sleeping on the gas
No brake pads no such thing as last
It may not mean nothing to yall
But understand nothing was done for me
So I dont plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever mayne ever mayne ever mayne
Im shutting shit down at the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I aint even planning to call
I want this shit forever mayne ever mayne ever mayne
There they go packing stadiums
As Shady spits his flow
Nuts they go macadamian they go so ballistic wow
We can make them look like bozos
Hes wondering if he should spit this slow
Fuck no go for broke
His cup just runneth over oh no
He aint had a buzz like this since the last time he overdosed
Theyve been waiting patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose
Back into the game and they know
Rap will never be the same as before
Bashing in the brains of these hoes
And establishing a name as he goes
The passion and the flame is ignited
You cant put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck Im talking about when we riot
You dealin with a few true villains
Whose staying inside of the booth truth spillin
And spit true feelings
Til our tooth fillings come flying up out of our mouths now rewind it
Payback muthafucka for the way you got at me so hows it taste
When I slap the taste out your mouth
With the bass so loud that it shakes the place
Im Hannibal Lecter so just in case youre thinking of saving face
You aint gonna have no face to save
By the time Im through with this place so Drake
It may not mean nothing to yall
But understand nothing was done for me
So I dont plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever mayne ever mayne ever mayne
Im shutting shit down at the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I aint even planning to call
I want this shit forever mayne ever mayne ever mayneLUPE FIASCO TALKING
Uh what up yall
Soundtrack whats popping baby
Yall aint know I go by the name of Lupe Fiasco
Representing that first and fifteen
Jyea uh
And this one right here
I dedicate this one right here
To all my homies out there grinding
You know what Im saying
Legally and illegally
Hahaha
You know what Im talking about
So check it out
VERSE one LUPE FIASCO
First got it when he was six
Didnt know any tricks
Matter of fact first time he got on it he slipped
Landed on his hip
And bust his lip
For a week he had to talk with a lisp
Like THISSSSS
Now we can end the story right here
But shorty didnt quit there was something in the air
Yea he said it was something so appealing
He couldnt fight the feeling
Something about it
He knew he couldnt doubt it
Couldnt understand it
Brand it just the first kickflip he land it
Uh labeled a misfit a bandit
Kakunk Kakunk Kakunk
His neighbors couldnt stand it so
He was banished to the park
Started in the morning wouldnt stop til after dark
Yea when they said Its getting late in here
so Im sorry young man theres no skating here
CHORUS
And so he kick push kick push kick push kick push coast
And away he rolled
Just a rebel to the world with no place to go
And so he kick push kick push kick push kick push coast
So come and skate with me
Just a rebel
Looking for a place to be
So lets kick and push and coast
VERSE two DRAKE
Waddup Lupe Chi Town
My style is very Tennessee
Mixed with some Terry Kennedy
People barley remember me from back in the day
I done got some contacts and threw the glasses away
The time it took me to get cool was a massive delay
But check it gets boring growing up in memphis
Trying to become a pro but keep showing up apprentice
Mama probably would have done anything to prevent this
Cause every single time I break a board it gets expensive
Luckly my aunt working as a nurse
So every time I needed something she just reach up in her purse
And plus shed always give me speeches on the first
If Im staying in her house then I need to get some work
I tell her I was there on vacation
She say you need to be doing something other than skating
Why dont you go kick it with your uncle in the basement
I ma let him know that your coming honey hes waiting
So now its me and old school
Chekka playa playing chess looking through old school wrek a airs
He knew I didnt really wanna post here
Open up the window told me that the coast clear
Now I coast clear take a deep breath feeling like the popes here
Homie this is Recess east test
Lifes ever given me a plus graded by a teacher in a sweet dress
Yes Im literly Landel Lewis with a kick and a snare
Kick flip in the air
The kids sick till them jeans put a rip in the pair
Just so the space aint restricted in here
Breathe again think its obvious that they need my soul
Cousins at the door like ri mi fa so
I say aunty this is a safe career
She said Drake I told you theres no skating here
CHORUS
And so he kick push kick push kick push kick push coast
And away he rolled
Just a rebel to the world with no place to go
And so he kick push kick push kick push kick push coast
So come and skate with me
Just a rebel
Looking for a place to be
So lets kick and push and coast
VERSE three LUPE FIASCO
Before he knew he had a crew
That wasnt no punk
And they spitfire shirts
And SB dunks
They would push til they couldnt skate no more
Office building lobbies wasnt safe no more
And it wasnt like they wasnt getting chased no more
Just the freedom was better than breathing they said
Any escape route they used to escape out
When things got crazy
They needed to break out
They head to any place with stairs
Any good grinds
The world was theirs
Uh and their four wheels would take them there
Until the cops came and said Theres no skating here
CHORUS
And so he kick push kick push kick push kick push coast
And away he rolled
Just a rebel to the world with no place to go
And so he kick push kick push kick push kick push coast
So come and skate with me
Just a rebel
Looking for a place to be
So lets kick and push and coastThis is why I do this shit
I think they call this uh venting
Yea
Look
Uh
This is me
Still the same
They want the hits
I play the game
No auto tune but you can feel the pain
It all comes spilling out like I hit a vein
What up lil braw
What up slumville
I hope you know that yall the reason I have fun still
The fans thinking that we all signed for one mill
Equal opportunities rapping that shit is unreal
That aint how it works
That aint that how it goes
And I been getting high to balance out the lows
And I could use a writer to balance my flows
But I never share my thoughts
This is all a nigga knows
And every time I try it opens up my eyes
These verses are a chance to remembered and reprized
And I would be performing just as long as Im alive
So every word I utter will be mine
Dont believe the lies
Look me in my eyes
Please dont be scared of me
Please dont be scared of me
I remember you
This feeling isnt new
So please dont be scared of me
Please dont be scared of me
Dont take this the wrong way but
I never cried when Pac died
But I probably will when Hov does
And if my tears hold value
Then I would drop one for every single thing he showed us
And Ill be standing in a puddle
I stay away from niggas that could land me in some trouble
And Ima keep it honest
Am so tired of being subtle
Its just me Forty O and Nich standing in a huddle
Staring at the members of my team
Who get questioned about they profit from this from million dollar scheme
Just know that am in debt for you defending all our dreams
I hope you tell your family this shit aint what it seems
But yall the reason for a lot of my devotion
You know I spend money because spending time is hopeless
And know I pop bottles cause I bottle my emotions
At least I put it all in the open
Dont believe the lies
Look me in my eyes
Please dont be scared of me
Please dont be scared of me
I remember you
This feeling isnt new
So please dont be scared of me
Please dont be scared of me
Oh oh oh oh oh uh
Look
Fuck all yall
We ignore feelings here
Premature millionaires
Welcome to my realest year
Yeah
I swear we making a killer here
I should be on top of the world here just chillin here
Uh
But its funny having fans
Who find you before anybody ever has the chance
And build you up so you could be the biggest in the game
And realize when your there sometimes the shit dont feel the same
Yeah
And plus things are just so real at home
People think Ive changed just because my appeals grown
And now security follow me everywhere
So Im never actually am alone I just always feel alone
I think Im scared of what the future holds
I was wishing for some things and now am used to those
Every girl I meet thinks Im fucking groupie hoes
The honesty of my music has left me too exposed
All my old friends think I got a new crowd
And people seem to notice every time I do smile
I guess that mean they come few and far between
Even though am living out what you would call the dream
Yeah
And my uncle aint even messaging me
And him missing in my life is kind of messing with me
I hope this isnt one of those forever things
Its funny how money can change everything
Dont believe the lies
Look me in my eyes
Please dont be scared of me
Please dont be scared of me
I remember you
This feeling isnt new
So please dont be scared of me
Please dont be scared of me
Oh oh oh oh oh uhDrake
My name is drizzy
and i aint perfect
but i work hard
so i deserve it
and i belong
right where you see me
aint on the fence about it
i aint mistah feeny
nah i got a decent set of manners
and a job that fills up any empty schedule or a planner
and i fall in love with girls caught up with superficial glamor
who dress like Sarah Jessica
and live like princess Diana
so often they have addictions
and im the one thatll feed it
but truly youre bad enough that you dont even really need it
you can show up at the party on dirty public transit
and i guarantee the cameraman will still be snappin candids
of you and your posse partying
drinking watch you get handed
with your virgin island tans
all lookin like you just landed
i dont really understand it
im not sure im comprehending it
but these girls are having fun with whoevas money they spendin
I got to be Unstoppable
I got to be Unstoppable
Ey ey ey ey
You dont lie
Ey ey ey ey
You dont lie
Wayne
My name is weezy
Im almost perfect
and i work harder than hard workin
bizarre circus
thats where my bar surface
therefore i act a clown
even when im laying on my back
im never backin down
so overstand me
i got a condo in Miami
and my doormat is always sandy
and i run Louisiana
but ive never pulled a hammy
and i got a condo in Atlanta
and i always wear a bandannie
and when it comes down to stuntin
you boys is just buntin and
im swinging for the fence
your girl hanging from my dick
your girl sanging to my shit
like ah loli loli pop
she say i get that pussy wetter than a dasani shop
she say i get that pussy better
better than her gynecologist
hoe just text me
everybody want some mo dick mo dick
old bitch
young bitch
but i be like damnnnn
all i got is one dick
Chorus
I got to be Unstoppable
I got to be Unstoppable
Ey ey ey ey
You dont lie
Ey ey ey ey

Santogold
I got the talk
The beats and bass
Give me one Ill take it
Make you lose your place
Tell me I-I-I can play
So I speed up the pace
I break it break it you cant stop me
In this ra-race
I got to be Unstoppable
I got to be unstoppable
ey ey ey ey
you dont lie
ey ey ey ey
you dont lieYes
Im on that old switch lane shit
Jay Biggs Dane shit
Talking about them niggas that my daddy pitch came with
Cause I never learned the biz i learned the language
Well spoken Man i shouldve went to Cambriege
And momma would always claim this
I never expected the outcome
But one day I became this
Famous
No longer nameless
More gain
But Im the same
I will remain this
Im still focused
I stay grounded
You see I ran with a style when they clowned it
So read forty-eight laws if you never read it
Cuz that is one of the main reasons Im level headed
Despite the accumalated success
If my attitude that was straight I made a regress
I never want to win the lottery only because my uncle told me
He who made it by struggling made it the best
So with that on my chest
Im down on my last twelve Gs
Going through my closet thinking
I should probably sell these
Chanel Cs and LVs
Somebody stop before I really start to rebel please
I spend it all
Who needs anymore
Whos satisfied doing good deeds anymore
Who grieves anymore
Who believes anymore
Who graduated school and still reads anymore
Not me
That should have my whole race shook
Cause we dont read novels
But we do face book
The new craze is having that new age look
If I said I liked it Id feel like a two faced crook
Nah
I tell retro kids
Tie that bandana just a little bit tighter til it suficates you biter
Cuz i dont wear bright colors or rope chains
Im a G my daddy was in the dope gameI swear to you Lord
Same dudes used to laugh at me
See me in the CLsix with half a B
They know that money begets money so naturally
Me and Half could blow a couple stacks hassle free
Im like fuck yall haters on behalf on me
Cause I could flood the city with a staff of three
Im talking me and two partners in that Caprice
With no copies made I got the master keys
And fast cars fast women fast cash and cream
Could mold you rappers like plasticine
I have to dream but dog me and success are two things
You dont wanna find yo ass between
Back against the wall like plasma screens
The inside of my wallet is pasture green
And you are now hanging with the Asthma Team
Sweetie catch your breath while I smash the scene
I should leave Earth nothing left to do here
Everyday is Christmas and every night is New Years
Say whatever I never been concerned about who hears
Call my town Sparta and Im coming with two spears
Im telling you dog always got the spring collection in fall
I run my bill up making executive calls
And with me women be building these skeptical walls
But once you slept with one dime man you slept with them all
Family money and music is all I ever knew
My necklace suffer from depression
Its forever blue
Cheer up baby You dont see all this revenue
I started the game at level two Im saying
Stop acting like teen girls are my only market
I parallel the fly and spur Tony Park it
And its cool if you spill something its only carpet
Thats why I get my interior color only dark shit
Torontos where you living today
And you aint making records that people are driven to play
I would advise you to really make a move
Sooner than later
Cause these are only the joints
That Im giving away
You feel meThe money money cars cars
The clothes clothes the hoes hoes I suppose
Yeuh I want the money money
Money and the cars cars
Cars and the clothes clothes
The hoes hoes I suppose
I just wanna be I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be I just wanna be successful
Drizzy oh yeah Trey I fucking feel ya
They be staring at the money like its unfamilia
I get it I live it to me theres nothings realer
Just enough to solve your problems
Too much would kill ya
And when I leave I always come right back here
The young spit it that everybody in rap fear
A lot of yall still sounding like last year
The game needs change and Im the motherfuckin cashier
Nickels for my thoughts
Dimes in my bed
Quarters of the kush
Shake the lines in my head
Take my verses too serious ya hate me
Cause Im the one to paint a vivid picture no H-D
Yeah I want it all thats why I strive for it
Dis me and youll never hear a reply for it
Any awards show or party Ill get fly for it
I know that its coming I just hope Im alive for it
I want the money money
Money and the cars cars
Cars and the clothes clothes
The hoes hoes I suppose
I just wanna be I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be I just wanna be successful
Yeah I want things to go my way
But as of late a lot of shit been going sideways
And my mother tried to runaway from home
But I left somethin in the car so I caught her in the driveway
And she cried to me so I cried too
And my stomach was soaking wet
She only fifty-two and forty eight hours all before I showed up
And brought a thousand dollars worth of drinks and got poured up
Damn my reality just set in
And even when the phantoms leased them hoes wanna get in
I do a lot of things hoping I never have to fit in
So trying to keep up with my progress is like a dead end
My girl love me but fuck it my heart beat slow
And right now the tour bus is lookin like a freak show
And life change for us every single week
So whats good but I know this aint the peak though cause I want
I want the money money
Money and the cars cars
Cars and the clothes clothes
The hoes hoes I suppose
I just wanna be I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be I just wanna be successful
Wise words from a decent man
Back when I was trying to put a ring on Alicia hand
This lost boy got fly without Peter Pan
And my delivery just got me buzzing like the pizza man
In person I am everything and more
Im everywhere these other niggas never been before
But inside Im treading waters steady trying to swim ashore
Im on a shoppin spree to get whatever is in store yeah
Just call me shop and bag drizzy
And call me Mr Damn He Aint Copin That Is He
And fans of this freshman is about to get iffy
While this youngin that you doubting is about to get busy
Im a kill it I promise this I know you mad
Ive always treated my city like some shoulder pads
To big homie use a flash if you must
And I swear I aint asking for much all I want is
I want the money money
Money and the cars cars
Cars and the clothes clothes
The hoes hoes I suppose
I just wanna be I just wanna be successfulthats all I wanted man
I just wanna be I just wanna be you gotta tell em trey successful
I just wanna be I just wanna be successful ful ful
Its like I know what I got to say
I just dont know how to say it to you
Uh pardon the swag but bitch its cartate
Long bread I dont eat shortcake
How come I cant miss a woman like I cant miss court dates
Cheese but shes not in this portrait
Yeah lifes fine but I do not portray
Im on the other side but it is a short gate
I dont want the glow I want the glory
And Im a fuck the world but this is just foreplay
Tired of hearing bullshit bring on the cow shit
Havent met a smell thats stinkier than our shit
And thats word to Toronto so high up I got birds in the condo aint that a female dog
Ask her who I am to her and she yell god

If I was unsuccessful would you be satisfied
I need a paramedic girl Im feeling paralyzed
If I could choose you will always be a friend to me
The more money I made you acting like my enemy

All the pressure would turn you into my diamond babe
How can something so familiar be so strange
Closest friends get estranged when the status change

And my homeboy Larry Live is the only one that had my back
You were the perfect girl now it seems we dont match
Is it the money want me to give it back

To me and Dwayne Carter putting out the hardest shit
I should want to go back to the one I started with
But Im addicted to this life its gonna be hard to quit
Yeah just ask me how things are coming along

We could take it out to Houston where the rides all glossed up
Anybody Im standin besides all bossed up
Burglar minded they say Im servin them rhymers
And me and Nickel F go together like burgers and diners yes
Im like a waiter and you something like a hater
With trays in both hands place an order I can cater uh
I got the diamonds in my teeth flow
Memphis is the reason that my rhyming and my speech slow
Peep though I only got pity for you lames
Sitting pretty in the game in the city that I claim
Yo the city is mine Which one
T-O-R-O-N-T-O
D-R-A-K-E thats me
You know how the story goes
Pull up range rove yo chick wanna roll

And I make em wanna
Shake shake it drop it drop it
Bounce it bounce it wop it wop it
Girl move that thang like you gettin money for college go
Shake shake it drop it drop it
Bounce it bounce it wop it wop it
Girl move that thang like you gettin money for college go
Break it down like you working for your tuition at Howard
Mama get it how you live that thang that you working is power
Tryna be generous so honey heres a tip
Now-a-days its gettin cheaper to put twentys on the whip
So if you a opportunist look for twentys in the clip
And if you find em attractive and funny thats when you dip dip
And its a trip my city broke into sections
Up North I got me a couple of troubles couple connections
And its nothing that I created on purpose
Theres people that gotta problem
But they scared to let it surface uh
Ya boy say this that and the third to em
See me out and they never utter a word to em
Expect me not to draw a card from the deck
Anybody in my city going hard I respect but
You got a debt and you choose not to pay that
Imma hop ya fence come into your yard and collect lect uh
It aint a problem of concern bruh
I always end up with exactly what I earn bruh
This aint last year money like a cashier
So hand your receipt if you tryna make a return bruh
Yessir I live in a city where a lot of people dont get shine shine
And I be on by the fence as soon as anybody stepping out of line line
And I got way too much love for the city I can never get too much of
And if anybody hatin on me I deport em the city is mine boy
Yo the city is mine Which one
T-O-R-O-N-T-O
D-R-A-K-E thats me

Pull up range rove yo chick wanna roll

Girl move that thang like you gettin money for college go
Shake shake it drop it drop it
Bounce it bounce it wop it wop it
Girl move that thang like you gettin money for college goOh baby Oh baby
Days in the sun
And nights in the rain
Summer is over simple and plain
I found me some fun thats good for the pain
I already told you I dont feel the same
I dont feel the same
Anywhere I go
I cant help but show
I dont feel the same
Anywhere I go
I cant help but know
I dont feel the same
Anywhere I go
I cant help but knowi heard once that they would rather hear about memories than enemies rather hear what was or what will be than what is rather hear how you got it over how much it cost you rather hear about finding yourself and how you lost you rather you make this an open letter about family and struggle and taking forever about hearts that youve broken and ties that youve severed no doubt in my mind that will make them feel betterSo hard to breathe this air that we call love
Aint nothing worse than the hurt we receive from love
When you get hurt by the one you living for
Pain can make you wanna love no more
Loving you no more
I just I cant I just cant be loving you no more
I love you more than I love myself
Loving you no more
I just I cant I just cant be loving you no more
I love you more than I love myself
Hurt with the heart thats bleeding slowly
So many lonely sleepless nights
Im going through hell to convince you love me
But never her approval no matter how I try
The way you talk to me but still I say I love you
Im ashamed you can see it in my eyes
Momma always told me to respect the woman
But what am I to do when her parents do not try
So many tears I cried
But all for nothing Im afraid to say
Ooh
Loving you no more
I just I cant I just cant be loving you no more
I love you more than I love myself
Loving you no more
I just I cant I just cant be loving you no more
I love you more than I love myself
Ive been so dependent on your love for so long
Punishment for me is trying to let go
Give it from your heart is what you taught me
Addiction to pain is what it got me
My life now its changed
My life aint the same as it was
Heart broke to the point sometimes wanna end it
If I cant have what mean most to me
So many tears I cried I cried
But all for nothing Im afraid to say
Loving you no more
I just I cant I just cant be loving you no more
I love you more than I love myself
Loving you no more
I just I cant I just cant be loving you no more
I love you more than I love myself
Diddy Drizzy baby
Uh trying not to over think
Only cause Ive drove and I done had a lot to drink
When I wanted it blue you said we got to paint it pink
And theres pieces of ya hair still sittin in my sink
And you still got underwear thats sittin in the dryer
How come every time that youre suspicious Im a liar
You stand out I can hear you whistle in a choir
And thats the only reason you the Mrs I admire
Damn tell me what Im gone do
Since everything Im trying to forget is all true
Me and all your main girls get along too
I would take my last dollar out and bet it on you
But uh you see the same one Im missing
Is basically the reason I became somethin different
Its just that I remember me before
And if you could do the same baby then well be for sure
So selfishly
You can only show fear
Unless you feel yours in jeopardy
Oh time oh time has changed
And Im no longer wiling
Cant you see how my heart is bleeding
Oh yes
Loving you no more
I just I cant I just cant be loving you no more
I love you more than I love myself
Loving you no more
I just I cant I just cant be loving you no more
I love you more than I love myself
Loving you no more
I just I cant I just cant be loving you no more
I love you more than I love myselfWhy do I feel so alone
Like everybody passing through the studio
Is in character as if we acting out a movie role
Talking bullshit as if it was for you to know
And I dont have the heart to give these
Bitch ass niggas the cue to go
So they stick around kicking out feedback
And I entertain it as if I need that
I had a talk with my uncle and he agreed that
My privacy about the only thing I need back but
Its hard to think of them polite flows
Mr Fano Poloto suits are your night clothes
And Jordan sweat suits are your flight clothes
And you still make it even when they say your flight closed
Eyes hurting from the camera phone light shows
Life was so full
Now this shit just being lipod
Always said Id say it all on the right track
But in this game you only lose when you fight back
Black diamond bracelets
Showing you the basics
I cant live and hold the camara
Someone gotta tape this
I make hits unlike a bitch
Thats married I aint miss
twenty-four hours from greatness
Im that close
Dont ever forget the moment
You began to doubt
Transitioning from fitting in to standing out
Los Angeles Cabanas or Atlanta South
Watchin HOV show
Embarrassed to pull my camera out
And my mother embarrassed
To pull my Phantom out
So I park about five houses down
She say I shouldnt have it until I have the crown
But I dont wanna feel the need to wear disguises around
So she wonder where my mind is accounts in the minus
But yet Im rolling round the fuckin city like your highness
Got niggas reactin without a sinus
Cause what Im working with is timeless
And promoters try to get me out to they club
They say I have fun but I cant imagine how
Cause I just seen my ex-girl
Standing with my next girl
Standing with the girl that Im fuckin right now
And shit could get weird unless they all down
And so I stay clear
We from a small town
Everybody talks and everybody listen
But somehow the truth just always comes up missing
Ive always been something that these labels cant buy
Especially if they tryin to take a peice of my soul
And Sylvia be tellin Tez Damn Drake fly
And he just be like Silly mother fucker I know
That was your bad
How could you pass up on em
He just take them records
And he gas up on em
Wayne will prolly put a million cash up on em
Surprised no one ever put your ass up on em
Oh they did Po
At least they tried to
And thats what happens
When you spitting whats inside you
But slip up and shoot the wrong fucking video
And they think they can market you
However they decide to nahh
But Forty told me to do me
And dont listen to anybody that knew me
Cause to have known me would
Mean that theres a new me
And if you think I changed in the slightest
Could of fooled me
Boy in my city Im da two-three
Drug dealers live vicariously through me
I quit school and its not because Im lazy
Im just not the social type
And campus life is crazy understand
I could get money with my eyes closed
Lost some of my hottest verses down in Cabo
So if you find a Blackberry with the side scroll
Sell that mothafucka to any rapper that I know
Cause they need it much more than I ever will
I got new shit
Im gettin better still
Little niggas put my name in they verses
Cause they girlfriend put my ass on a pedesteel
Future said cause this Ye shit you better kill
And I think this got this Making of a Legend feel
Problem with these other niggas they
Aint never real
Yea thats all I can sayRIP to the girl you use to see
Her days are over baby shes over
Ive decided to give you all of me
Baby come closer baby come closer
Im ready for you
Kill em all switch it up
Put it on zip it up
Let my perfume soak into your sweater
Say youll be here soon the sooner the better
No option for you saying no
I run this game just play your role
Follow my lead what you waiting for
Thought it over and decided tonight is the night

Yeah I hear you talking
Dont know who you tryna flatter

You dont seem to understand

Red lipstick on the wine glass
Cameras in my mind flash
Black laghdurey white diamonds what a contrast
I know you get impatient as the time pass
You say you want it fast define fast
Cause I could speed it up and make it last
Or I could adition for this and i could be part of the cast
And i could produce for your future
I could co-direct your past
And make damn sure that you never forget it
Committed
Im ready Im wit it
Still here like a statue
Pink champagne green ink in your tattoos
You say you got baggage

Its been a moment since Ive done some public speaking
I find now-a-days its just best to keep quiet
But uh sometimes you just gotta let it out
Young Angel and Young Lion

And if I die Im a do it reppin I never do it second
I swear niggas be eyein me all hard
And lyin to they girls and drivin the same cars
Sittin there wishin their problems became ours
Cause we have nothin in common
Since I done became star
I done became big swervin right in to my peers lane
Same dudes that used to holla my engineers name
One touch I could make the drapes and the sheers change
An show me the city that Ill without fear claim
What I set seems to never extinguish
Coolest kid out baby word to Chuck Inglish
Count my own money see the paper cut fingers
My song is ya girlfriends wakin up ringer
Heh or alarm or whatever
She be here at six in the morn if I let her
But I never get attracted to fans
Cause a eager beaver could be the collapse of a dam
I always knew that I could figga
How to get these label heads to offer em good figures
And me doin the shows gettin everyone nervous cause
Them hipsters gon have to get alone with them hood niggas
Its all good Im goin off like lights when the shows over
Make pasta rent a movie call hoes over
Rest in peace to Heath Ledger but Im no joker
Ill slow roast ya got no holster
Wet glass on ya table nigga no coaster
Burn bread everyday boy no toaster
G and Tez got a sig but Im no smoker
They just handin chips to me nigga no poker

My cup runneth over
The same niggas I ball with I fall with
On some Southern drawl shit

Jones Junior fightin the drugs and gun charge

What if I just know what you like
And if feels right then its over with
What if I dont call you back prove you right
All this lasts is just one night
Baby we should slow it down
Hey girl Im back in Atlanta
Seconds dates are lovely
This time you should choose where we go

Put a rush on it get it over with
What if I just know what you like
And if feels right then its over with
What if I dont call you back prove you right
All this lasts just one night
Baby we should slow it down
Girl I aint pimp girl I aint a player no
I aint tryina move too fast so Im just gonna take it slow
Girl I just wanna know
What would happen if we made love
Would we have the same feelings when we wake up
Will be still spends hours on the phone
Wishing we was alone
Would you speak to me in a totally different tone
I know but I guarantee two thing in life
One is death and the other is I can change you whole life in one night
Doing wrong always feels so right
It can start up with kiss leading to a touch
Forming a relationship based solely around lust
Im trying to move slow relaxing the drift
But every time I do my brains reaction is this
What if we happen to kiss and we touch
Put a rush on it get it over with
What if I just know what you like
And if feels right then its over with
What if I dont call you back prove you right

Baby we should slow it down
Maybe we should slow it down
If youre ready we can go all the way baby
We can go all the way
Baby we should slow it downUh Im just so far gone
Octobers on Please leave me alone
Drunk off champagne screamin in the phone
See my house is not a home fuck is goin on
Where did we go wrong where do we belong
Caught up in the game and its one I cant postpone
Meaning if it rains Im the one its raining on
When my diamond chain is on still nothing set in stone
Women borrow sweaters that I spray with my cologne
And tell me dont forget em and I promise that I wont
Feelin so distant from everyone Ive known
To make everybody happy I think I would need a clone
Places we get flown parties that weve thrown
Ive done more for this city then these rappers that have blown
Its only been three years look at how Ive grown
Im just in my zone I call this shit the calm
Yea but Im the furthest thing from calm
Dedicated to my mom and I swear my word is bond
Everything will be OK and it wont even take that long
You can see it in my face or even read it on my palm
Leader of the new school its proven and its known
Im sittin in a chair but in the future its a throne
I know you like to worry itll be better if you dont cause
You know
Everything gone be alright
I promise
Apologize to you know
To put yall in this position and vent to yall but
forty Mom always say
Dont ask permission just ask forgiveness you know so
Forgive me
Yea
Yeah I say
Uh
And life is so insane
Look what Ive became
Tryna make a name
All my first dates are interrupted by my fame
Because every picture taken is a fan that you can gain
They love it when you smile unaware that its a strain
Its a curse you gotta live with when you born to entertain
Women need attention therefore women will complain
Develop hatred for men and say that your the one to blame
Tryna enjoy myself with Taz in Miami at the game
I just wish he knew how much it really weighed like Dwayne
Its a weight thats on my chest whoever spottin me is playin
So Im liftin all alone try not to get a sprain
Hopin western union doing currency exchange
Cause my dad called and got me feelin guilty and ashamed like
How I had a Rolls and I went and got a Range
And he payin for his cigarettes with dollars and some change
Damn and I could only feel his pain
Cause in Memphis Tennessee theres only so much to attain
So Im fillin out the form at the counter once a-gain
He say he love me I just hope he doesnt say that shit in vain
Im why yo girl heart is in a slang
Call me heartbreak Drake Im the hardest one to tame
As a man Im just honest as a artist Im a king
With my own set of problems that be sittin on my brain
Yea And see this is the thang
What they viewing as braggin is the way that I maintain
The shit I write while staring out the window of a plane
Is the single handed reason I remain
Me
Yea
Uh I said I call this shit the calm
But Im the furthest thing from calm
I swear Im puttin on
But they always wanna ask what type of act you puttin on like
ManYeah uh huh
Um uh huh OK
Hello motherfer

You know what it is if you heard drake
Makin hoes wobble like a bridge in a earthquake
Never see me out
Cause I live in my workplace
I give you the business
So button up your shirt straight
Look at where I landed
You would think I planned it
Im just doin me and you could never understand it
Chicks get hammered
Big dick bandit
Money flowin like a slit wrist no bandage
Blowin purple clouds n Im so sky high
I aint cuttin anybody slices outta my pie
Outta this world though Im so sci-fi
And I dont sit still I keep it movin like a drive-by
I just tell the truth so Im cool in every hood spot
Twenty one years and I aint ever met a good cop
Me and Wayne lean like Kareem doin hook shots
Cover me Im goin in and I aint fin with no hood cops

If I said Im goin in then I motherfin meant it
And if I brought it in the club
Then Im a motherfin spend it
Cost a few hundred bands
And Im motherfin in it
No need for a room
Yea you know Im fin in it
She actin like she not but she know she fin with it
She said I seen it all
I said no you fin didnt
You ever busted nuts in a two seater
She said I cant feel my legs
Im like b me neither

Where should I begin
I dont even know maybe where my blunt ends
And Im a be a legends even when my life ends
And Im a be a legend even when this night ends
Til I do my thing hop up out it like biem

You cant love but I bet ya
Yo cant hine yeah
Here we Gooo
The onest time aroud
I left the cars at the house
And I put the diamonds down
Them things come and they go its bout the rhymein Now
Im seeing it clearer
The season is nearer
And still I must change
Im like a broken bill
Conservative for the most
But Im out spoken still
They not sure itll work
But their all hopein Hell
Emerge the victim
My words are pictures
And yes the colors so loud that u heard my scripture
With four walls
Give me the right brush and I draw all
I promise I been thinkin before yall
I barely get tired
Im rarely inspired
And you accompish in a week is What Im daily required
Im meetin qoutas while you rappers having sleep overs
Spending nights in studio try to be Hova
Be in the thrown instead of being ya own
But look
Chorus
Young Check your freestyle
I am fast approachin on the weekend
Its me Niko Bryans here Dten
Freestyle shit bout the safeway to the verse here we go
Its like Im makin moves in my city tho
My ex girls wanna be up in the video
They ex girls are steady tryin to get with tho
Important and vital
Im caught in a cycle
And this is all I know
And yes I know it well
I try to explain
And my effort comes to no avail
Im from the place where they release records and no one sells
And still they claim king
Nigga its the same thing
All day long
But thats the screw face
Rappers will friend you at onest but really they two faced
Hopein u trip and slip over your own shoe lace
Thats why I tuck em in not givin a fuck again
DRA you add the KE a hundred grand and you lables can not
Play me
Ill never go broke
Fuck em Im flashin the pan
I am a passionate man
Planted with cash in my hand uhhThis shit was all I knew
You and me only
I did it all for you
Still you were lonely
We can work it out
Uhh But I guess things change
Its funny how someone elses success brings pain
When youre no longer involved
That person has it all
You just stuck standin there
Im gonna need you to say something baby
Say say something baby say something baby say something baby
Im gonna need you to say something baby
Im gonna need you to say something baby
Yeah it really sucks whenever since Ive been long gone
I traded in my senorita for a microphone
I hate the way you fell apart girl its sad to see
Your life is good but me and you were a catastrophe
If I was unsuccessful would you be satisfied
I need a paramedic girl Im feeling paralyzed
If I could choose you will always be a friend to me
The more money I made you acting like my enemy
Its crazy I cant help it if youre really ashamed
All the pressure would turn you into my diamond babe
How can something so familiar be so strange
Closest friends get estranged when the status change
Ah is it my mistake think that where I am and where you at
And my homeboy Larry Live is the only one that had my back
You were the perfect girl now it seems we dont match
Is it the money want me to give it back
This shit was all I knew
You and me only
I did it all for you
Still you were lonely
We can work it out
Uhh but I guess things change
Its funny how someone elses success brings pain
When youre no longer involved
That person has it all
You just stuck standin there
But Im gonna need you to say something baby
Say say something baby say something baby say something baby
Im gonna need you to say something baby
Im gonna need you to say something baby
I am the topic of conversation
This is celebration
Lets toast to the fact that Ive moved out my mamas basement
To a condo downtown cause its all about location
Im sitting drink wine and watch Californication of life
You should have been here to kick it with me
We could have split this whole thing up fifty fifty
But now Im at the forty forty getting bitches tipsy
Killing shit the ever so talented Mr Ripley
How I go from being the man that you argue with
To me and Dwayne Carter putting out the hardest shit
I should want to go back to the one I started with
But Im addicted to this life its gonna be hard to quit
Yeah just ask me how things are coming along
You could tell me that youve never heard none of my songs
As long as you end up saying one day you plan to listen
Cause whats a star when its most important fan is missingVerse one
Its ten oclock on a Wednesday and I know your home
Driving up and down your street hoping that you come outside
Cause I just got paid and I went and bought the car you wanted
And I just need you to see me ohh
Childish as it seems itll make it all better better
Selfish as it is this just aint about you no
Did me wrong every time were together gether
Bridge
And thats why Im gonna stunt on you
Im gonna stunt on you
You let me go little did you know
I could have made it all on my ownSean Garrett
Junior high played them High school played them College well you know played them Me and my friends use to laugh about it how we fade em Now Cupid is aiming his arrow right there at me No more nonchalence can I be with you here starring at me With the most beautiful eyes that a nigga ever seen You pull an emotional vibe from my Soul look at me You got my heart beating like my back is filled with batteries
Chorus
For the first time Im in love And I wanna tell everybody And I wanna tell everybody what im feeling For the first time I feel love And I wanna tell everybody And I wanna tell everybody the feel
Drizzy Drake
Drake
All them men before me did shit I would never do And I know you got your guards up but they should let him through Just keep fightin for our lovin baby Ill defend it too And if they try and tell me time is money Id spend it with you I spend it all I spend it all I charge forever to my card And pay it off no interest lost I be right here and like your favorite wine girl Im worth trying but take it easy on me Cuz this my first time courtesy OriginaLyricInfo Chorus

Chorus
For the first time Im in love And I wanna tell everybody And I wanna tell everybody what im feeling For the first time I feel love And I wanna tell everybody And I wanna tell everybody the feeling
For the first time Im in love And I wanna tell everybody And I wanna tell everybody what im feeling For the first time I feel love And I wanna tell everybody And I wanna tell everybody the feeling

EndLykke Li
Hands down
Im too proud for love
But with eyes shut
Its you Im thinking of
Drake
But how we move from A to B it cant be up to me
cause you dont know
Who I was before you
Basically to see a change in me
Id be losing so I just ignore you yeah
Oh oho
But your on my mind my mind my mind my mind my mind
Oh oho
But maybe in time in time in time
Ill tell you
Chorus
A little bit a little bit
A little bit in love with you
I guess that Im a little bit a little bit a little bit in love with you
Oh oho
Drake
I know you told me break their hearts
But its you I wanna take apart
And I will never ever be the first to say it
But still I they know I ah ah ah
Lykke Li
I would do it
Push a button
Pull a trigger
Climb a mountain
Jump off a cliff
cause you know baby I love you love you
A little bit
You would do it
You would say it
Youd mean it
I would let you do it
It was you and I and I only
Ha hm
I think Im a little bit
Little bit
A little bit in love with you
But only if youre a little bit
Little bit
Little bit
In lo-lo-lo-lo-love with me
Drake
I hope they never find out
What they already know know know
As soon as its official
Well have to let it go go go
So we dont confirm the fling
Keep avoiding all the questions
You could teach me many things
Im just scared to learn a lesson
The pressures on
Both hearts beat like a metronome
Both nsync like a Justin song
Feels so right but its just so wrong
I wonder where my whereabouts
Where niggas that I know tryna talk my girl out
And her friends say I aint the one to go for
She just get jealous cause you always get approached more
Oh well tell her fall back
caught up in some more shit
tell her call back
Tell her get a man that aint cheating on her ass
With a girl that I know yeah tell her all that that
And as for you I think I know youre the one
The closest Ive come
Im probably
A little bit
A little bit
A little bit in love with you
I guess that Im a little bit
A little bit
A little bit
A little bit in love with you
Oh oho
Lo-lo-lo-lo-love with me
Oh oho oh ohoYeah look
Its what you all been waiting for aint it
Your weekly entertainment
For me to get a hold of this beat
And go ahead claim it
Im bout to paint a picture
You niggas go ahead frame it
Since we gettin Seinfeld
On some Jerry and Elaine shit
I flow far from mediocre
And if we talking cards I will fold him with the poker
You and your whole crew are like a deck of fifty-four
So its obvious yall gone steady be rollin with some jokers
Uh and me Im rolling with some brokers
Like damn could you niggas get any broker
I got my new girl so content
Just save yourself the embarrassment dont even approach her
Disguise yourself go buy a costume
I am making stocks work while you working stock rooms
Uh and I was praying I would drop June
But label reps applying pressure to make them pop tunes
So I keep it rocking for peets sake
You fake gangsta rappers are cliche
And if you aint talking dough when you meet Drake
Ill be in your face
Like No speak a la ingls
Soon as you hear it you quote it
They tryin to be the one that I done left out the show with
But trust me Im aware and my cars right there
Is this interior enough for your ulterior motives
Cause if you like it you should stick with me
My money good I aint neva had to flip a key
A lotta ice a lotta cream like Dickey D
Might cut the phone and disapear like Mishy Me
But Im tryna have you on that trip with me
Slidin through Henry Bendale like its slippery
And yo ex man is a hater officially
Probably cause he know Im exactly what you wish hed be
Yeah thats the reason why he looking hard
Cause I done snatched the Chips Ahoy out his cookie jar
He just mad cause his girl at the house
With her tounge stickin out
Like a Michael Jordan rookie card
Let me address this pardon me while I fix
A couple subliminal lines caught me in the mix
I guess he thought that he couldve been gotti in the flix
But at this point Im just poking a body with a stick
Now-a-days rapping is a childrens hobby
And girls keep telling me Im still as snobby
I tell them myself is who I am feeling probably
Just because I gotta buzz like a building lobby
It aint a song that your ass finna skipp
I tried to sell weed give me cash for this zip
The way your girlfriend pump me up in the car
Seem like she dont really need no gas for the trip
Millionaire shades fade with the waves
I smirk at a nigga if he still rockin braids
That just lets me know that we aint on the same page
And that goes out to every nigga except Trey
Eyy Im outta here baby they asked me about the past years and how does it phase me
I wouldnt take it back nah not if you pay me
Mister betcha thats expensive cause its not a Fugazi
Spittin a crock pot of bottomless gravy
The shit is so nasty how is it tasty
And you can probably find him walking out of a Macys
Forget it girl they just thinking how to replace me
Exit with a joke leave these niggas some hope
You took the Ye beat and you put that shit in a joke
Well Im thinking I should leave out on this note
Nigga keep your two cents I aint trynna leave you broke
Life of a Don lights keep glowin
Come up in the club with that fresh shit on
Something crazy on my arm
And heres another hit barry bondsIntro

su-woop to the whoa oh oh ohhIm tryin do it all tonight
I got plans
I got a certain lust for life
And as it stands
Everything is going as right
As it can
They tryin to shoot down my flight
Before it lands
Before it lands
But you could miss me with all that
Diss me then crawl back
I really wish yall will fall back
But gettin rich suppose to slove that
And these days women make offers and who the hell am I to say
No no no
My ex send late night text cause she dont know how to let
Go go go
She in love
And as for them pretty light skinned models standin in the cold oh yea they with us
Let them girls in for a drink
And Im all in they ear
Saying she should be the one I see
Everytime that Im here but when am I really even here
Black surburban wit the tent on it
Fresher than a pillow with a mint on it
The game got these old hand prints on it
But ima be the one to pour cement on it
And start over
And show up in a Margiela tux
I dont really give a fuck
And we only getting older
So what i tend to do is to think of today as the past
Its funny when u coming in first but you hope that you last
You just hope that it last
that it last
that it last
that it last
that it last




Throw your ones up in the air

You could have my heart or we could share it like the last slice
Always felt like you were so accustomed to the fast life
Have a nigga thinking that he met you in a past life
Sweat pants hair tied chillin with no make-up on
Thats when youre the prettiest I hope that you dont take it wrong
You dont even trip when friends say you aint bringing drake along
You know that Im working I be there soon as I make it home
And she a patient in my waiting room
Never pay attention to the rumors and what they assume
And until em girls prove it Im the one they never get confused wit

Sex love pain baby I be on that tank shit
Buzz so big I could probably sell a blank disk
When my album drop bitches will buy it for the picture
And niggas will buy two and claim they got it for they sister
Magazine paper girl but money aint the issue
They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial
She call me the referee cause I be so official
My shirt aint got no stripes but I can make your pussy whistle
Like the Andy Griffith theme song
And who told you to put them jeans on
Double cup love youre the one I lean on
Feeling for a fix than you should really get your fiend on
Yeah just know my condo is the crack spot
Every single show she out there reppin like a mascot
Get it from the back and make ya fuckin bra strap pop
All up in your slot till a nigga hit the jack pot
Baby youre my everything youre all I ever wanted
We could do it real big bigger than you ever done it

You just jumped my style
You just stole my flow
You just seen me out
You gets no hello
And you wonder why
Man you know you know
Yeah and you should let them boys know too
Show them niggas every single thing I showed you
Im here feeling like fifty back in two
And everybody saying Im the man
So true
Yeah but what does it take to feel secure
A place with wooden floors
A space to put awards
A couple of parking spots
And maids to do the chores
The cars you always wanted
And women that you adore
Well I got it I got it
I wonder if Id be happy without it
I doubt it
I try not to really think about it
I made it but Im still playing like Im being scouted till Im out it
Game time bitch
I hope your proud of us
King James shit
Watch me throw the powder up
This old G got my whole suite clouded up
And I bet you I be outta time before Im outta luck
They aint rooting for me
They aint clapping for me
Im only saying iwhy cant someone be happy for me
I really hate to say I told you so
So I bite my tongue
But you know you know
This is hard right
Please make your long story shorter
Cos time is at the essence for the king of first quarter
Numbers do the talking
I have nothing for reporters
I just hope we get these flights and dont get held up at the border
Yeah so you can spare me all the alcalays
Im the real reason you can find my city on an atlas page
Half a million dollars later and my tax is paid
And Im still spitting money from my active days
Damn life is such a lovely thing
Feel the perks that a seven digit budget bring
Tell your girlfriend that I could pull some fucking strings
So at courtside when Im wrong get a fucking ring
Yeah I bet Ill be there Ill be there
You see that sixty-two sitting outside
Thats me there
Im jumping to the time thats my leap year
Prepare
Putting in that overtime
I never said itd be fair
Im always left wishing that I could of done it in person
My apologies to all of the ones I was hurting
I got new girls but none of their love is for certain
I call old girls but none of their numbers are working
Damn what happened to us
Life can always change
You have to adjust
How come when I gotta carter you stare at me in disgust
I say its just to have fun
You should see that as a plus
Especially when I come flying through the door
I cant ignore
The paparazzi outside trying to record
Whys every woman never down here before
Am I the only twenty-three year old why cant I soar
The rough child the crews the guy thats in the open seats
Its always nice when your out with someone who notices
A condo got that art gallery openings
Im just hoping that isnt what my hoping is
They aint rooting for me
They aint clapping for me
Im only saying why cant someone just be happy for me
I really hate to say I told you so
So I bite my tongue
But you know you knowAy

When the lights dont glow the same way that they use to
And I finally get a moment to myself
I will realize you were everything Im missing
And you tell me youre in love with someone else
So can you do me a favor if I pull it together
Make it sooner than later we wont be here forever
And I realize I waited to know
But please dont move on
You dont need no one else
You dont need no one else oh
You dont need no one else
You dont need no one else oh
You dont need no one else
You just changed your hair and it looks perfect
Wish I was the first to let you know
Every chance I get to make it better
I just find a way to let it go
When the lights dont glow the same way that they use to
And I finally get a moment to myself
I will realize you were everything Im missing
And you tell me youre in love with someone else
So can you do me a favor if I pull it together
Make it sooner than later we wont be here forever
And I realize I waited to know
But please dont move on
You dont need no one else
You dont need no one else oh
You dont need no one else
You dont need no one else oh
You dont need no one else
The girl or the world you see someone gotta lose
I thought I could have it all do I really gotta choose
What good is all the cash if it doesnt buy time
And what good is bein famous if Im never on your mind
Nights fallen light glowing
And Im just tryna pay the price owing
And I dont wanna feel the comfort from my ice showing
And I aint tryna be without you at the right moments
Nigga nice goin is it worth it that decision
Cause hearts break and I aint tryna be in that collision
So Ima dust my shirt and fix my pants
Cause I better look good girl if this my chance I swear
So can you do me a favor if I pull it together
Make it sooner than later we wont be here forever
And I realize I waited to know
But please dont move on
You dont need no one else

Wishing their problems became ours
Cuz we have nothing in common
Since I done became star
I done became bigger
Swervin right into my peers lanes
Same dudes that used to holler my engineers name
One touch
I could make the drapes and the sheers change
And show me the city
That I without fear claim
What I set seems to never extinguish
Coolest kid out baby

Always knew that I could figure
How to get these label heads to offer him good figures
And me doing the shows
Getting everyone nervous

Im getting rich aah you staying broke
chilling if even if Im in a goose down coat
I cant see you through the Mosley Tribes
so i dont even flinch when you throw me high fives
they try to measure up but theres no one my size
Whatever forty smokin bout to low my eyes
Beast mode on them I never take a night off
Every single thing a nigga purchase is a write-off
Grounded as the one way pavement am taking flight off
baby go ahead and cut the light off
cuz Its about to go
BEAT PLAYS
I hear my phone ringing when ya call
I aint picking up or entertaining them at all
Got your girl face down banging on the wall
While you and all your homeboys hang at Lenox Mall
mmm mmm mmm
I cannot relate
Riding with some tags that a got from out-of-state
Riding with a swag that a got from outer space
Just show me whos the hottest imma knock him out his place
call me homicide drizzy about to kill your ego
Im about ma green puffin goody like im Cee Lo
You can go and take a glance at your hero
while the Houston ship a pole dancing zero

Im Im so fresh a stylist would agree
waving at your girl
while shes smiling back at me likeKanye West
All of the lights

Drake

I grew up thinking I was wrong
and always said that if they let me in the b-tch
Id do some damage
I might be out of mind
but if I am its just in time
because I got the extra nation so you f-cking understand it man
Im already show you n-gga what I
Kanye West
Something wrong
I hold my head
MJ gonethat n-gga dead
I slapped my girl she called the feds
I did that time and spent that bread
Im heading home Im almost there
Im on my way heading up the stairs
to my surprise a n-gga replacing me
I had to take em to that ghetto university
Chorus

lights flash lights spot lights
strobe lights street lights
all of the lights
all of the lights
flash lights strobe lights
thug lights rock lights
stripper lights
all of the lightshey there material girl
The neighbors told me that youre moving out
Leaving to witness the world
But are you sure thats what youre doing now
are you running away for a purpose
Do you even know what your self worth is
the past what you carry in your purses
the gift in the curse when you going head first is
the ATL MIA LAX JFK
luggage all packed and to them I say
farewell to the pure amen I pray
You wander the world
you seek what youve lost
youre waking up every day
the run away run away girl
I turn and your gone
youre leaving to chase your fame
the run away the run away girl
so long
farewell
good bye
good day
be on
your way
run away girl

Watching it all through the window
and wishing you could make is shatter now
now that youre here on the other side
are you sure it even matters
are you living the dream
are you telling all your girls that it aint what it seems
do you strip do you model do you live in between
and look for the split second that you get on the screen like
you wander the world
you seek what you lost
youre waking up every day
to run away run away girl
I turn and youre gone
youre leaving to chase your fame
you run away run away girl
so long
farewell
good bye
good day
be on your way
run away girl
It may not mean nothing to yall
But understand nothing was done for me
So I dont plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever mayne ever mayne ever mayne
Im shutting shit down at the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I aint even planning to call
I want this shit forever mayne ever mayne ever mayne
Last name ever
First name greatest
Like a sprained ankle boy aint nothing to play with
It started off local but thanks to all the haters
I know Gfour pilots on a first name basis
In your city faded off the brown Nino
She insists she got more class we know
Swimming in the money come and find me Nemo
If I was at the club you know I balled chemo
Dropped the mixtape that shit sounded like an album
Whod have thought a country wide tour would be the outcome
Labels want my name beside the X like Malcolm
Everybody got a deal I did it without one
Yeah nigga Im about my business
Killing all these rappers you would swear I had a hit list
Everyone who doubted me is asking for forgiveness
If you aint been a part of it at least you got to witness
Bitches
It may not mean nothing to yall
But understand nothing was done for me
So I dont plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever mayne ever mayne ever mayne
Im shutting shit down at the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I aint even planning to call
I want this shit forever mayne ever mayne ever mayne
Forever ever Mr West is in da building
Aint no question who about to kill em
I used to have hood dreams
Big fame big chains
I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came
I went hard all fall like the ball teams
Just so I can make it rain all spring
Yall seen my story my glory
I had raped the game young
You can call it statutory
When a nigga blow up they can build statures of me
Old money Benjamin Button what nothin
Now superbad chicks giving me McLovin
You would think I ran the world like Michelles husband
You would think these niggas would know me when they really doesnt
Like they was down with the old me no you fucking wasnt
Youre such a fucking loser
He didnt even go to class Bueller
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back
Remember she had that bad hip like a fanny pack
Chasing that stardom would turn you into a maniac
All the way in Hollywood and I cant even act
They pull their cameras out and God damn they snap
I used to want this thing forever yall can have it back
It may not mean nothing to yall
But understand nothing was done for me
So I dont plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever mayne ever mayne ever mayne
Im shutting shit down at the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I aint even planning to call
I want this shit forever mayne ever mayne ever mayne
OK hello its the martian Space Jam Jordans
I want this shit forever wake up and smell the Garden
Fresher than the harvest
Step up to the target
If I had one guess than I guess Im just New Orleans
And I will never stop like Im running from the cops
Hopped up in my car and told my chauffeur to the top
Life is such a fucking roller coaster then it drops
But what should I scream for this is my theme park
My minds shine even when my thoughts seem dark
Pistol on my side you dont wanna hear that thing talk
Let the king talk check the price and pay attention
Lil Wayne thats what they got to say or mention
Im like Nevada in the middle of the summer
Im resting in the lead I need a pillow and a cover
Shh my foots sleeping on the gas
No brake pads no such thing as last
It may not mean nothing to yall
But understand nothing was done for me
So I dont plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever mayne ever mayne ever mayne
Im shutting shit down at the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I aint even planning to call
I want this shit forever mayne ever mayne ever mayne
There they go packing stadiums
As Shady spits his flow
Nuts they go macadamian they go so ballistic wow
We can make them look like bozos
Hes wondering if he should spit this slow
Fuck no go for broke
His cup just runneth over oh no
He aint had a buzz like this since the last time he overdosed
Theyve been waiting patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose
Back into the game and they know
Rap will never be the same as before
Bashing in the brains of these hoes
And establishing a name as he goes
The passion and the flame is ignited
You cant put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck Im talking about when we riot
You dealin with a few true villains
Whose staying inside of the booth truth spillin
And spit true feelings
Til our tooth fillings come flying up out of our mouths now rewind it
Payback muthafucka for the way you got at me so hows it taste
When I slap the taste out your mouth
With the bass so loud that it shakes the place
Im Hannibal Lecter so just in case youre thinking of saving face
You aint gonna have no face to save
By the time Im through with this place so Drake
It may not mean nothing to yall
But understand nothing was done for me
So I dont plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever mayne ever mayne ever mayne
Im shutting shit down at the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I aint even planning to call
I want this shit forever mayne ever mayne ever mayneDrake
Pay attention its on
Staring at my city lights through the plain window as I write this song
Have faith when I do it
Imma do it bigger than they think
I dont just flow I over flow I be filling up the sink
Like I left the water on I run this bitch if anybody ask
Aint much change since high school
N-ggas still be in and out of class
S class or the brand new clfive on them haters
Black paint chrome trim same color as the logo for the raiders
I just said that cause Im not with california near the studio with taz
You should give us credit n-ggas killin people we can be all doin that instead
But we not we just kill the summer every single time I come around
Never chase hoes but we do we laugh at them n-ggas tryin to run em down
Not I not me YMOB call jaz call c
Bet both of them would agree
Get viewed get judged get booed get loved
Shit get done round here do you not us
Chorus
Im gon do what I want
Cause this lifes made for living
You got to know nothings for sure
Faith in the stars
Im gon do what I want
Cause this lifes what Im given
Gotta keep my faith in the dark clouds
K-os
Once upon a time I met
On this cold explosive dosage she wrote this
But tell me who chose this
Sin citys innocent really when its inside my mind
And co-sign with a rhyme and a big pen
Once again its an even odd
Cant applaud with one hand
Cant be God with one fan
Or can you stan you
If not pastor jackson daniels rip that hit that
Now I sip that lightly when Im on my mic tightly
And I write nightly like Spike Lee
Let me break it down
I been having a maid since the eightth grade with a fade
Rapping by the swings
And the bell never really rings
Class in session theres no recession
For this upper echelon mic testing its
K-dash-O-S F-R-E-S-H in the place
With a grace in and outta space
Gotta race
Dont be something that you really not
Sabotage the universal plot
When the planet earth rock gets hot
From the sun dont get got just get God yeah see that
Do you believe
ChorusMy Mazeradi and Ferrari like to chill with my Mercedes
See my Bentley what I got when my two Phantoms had a baby
Im not crazy why you lazy I get so politely daisy
Fuck you pussy nigga pay me my Lambo do bout two hundred and eighty
I sellin heard you tellin thought you killin while you stealin
Thought you dealin while you chillin you aint ballin with a million
God made me super rich the devil made you stupid bitch
You could be just like me if you quit with all that stupid shit
Why you actin hard now you must want go see God now
The same niggas you were beefin with are up in your yard now
If you bout to run dogg I guess you better start now
Forgot to bring your gun so you got to use your heart now
Its hard to get rich but it aint shit to go to hell
Its hard to sell dope but it aint shit to go to jail
Its hard to keep it real but it aint shit for you to tell
I smoked so much of this that I cant even hide the smell
So drop
Drop drop drop
Now drop
Drop drop drop
We marijuana farmers all our rides look like Transformers
Tell the pretty girls to pull they titties out and dance for us
You dont need a Gym Class crack like Slim Fast
Take a hit and loss a fuckin hundred pounds quick fast
Snow cone with a chain on and deep off or chain off
My blunt goin kick the game off we never take the game off
Find a hater sign a hater let him see my elevator
Hundreds in my refrigerator now they know we gettin paper
Find a hater sign a hater let him see my elevator
Hundreds in my refrigerator now they know we gettin paper
Pullin coupes and escalators enemies on respirators
Million dollar generators ninety fast investigators
For flashy cars the prison bars mnage trois
The playin cards I swear its hard now drop
Now drop
Drop drop drop
Now drop
Drop drop dropDrake - Verse one

Im ready
Alright J Prince I got em
Look Im really the heir
To the fortune of a millionaire
Talking money with mes really unfair
At the border like I swear
I have nothing to declare
I am nothing like these other niggas coming out this year
Even if you never met me
You can tell Im on that same shit
Loyal as a motherfucker
Nobody be saying shit
Dope boys know me
Cuz I often speak they language
So well spoken
Man I shouldve went to Cambridge
YOUNG hoe
Women they can be so
Motivated by money
Thats why they be on me foe
Ask your favorite rapper homie
Guarantee that he know
If he is the one
Im the zero
Damn
Please comprehend
I am a surf club general
Im mister consistent
I have never come in intervals
You dont wanna be caught in the middle
Like a centerfold
Im committing suicide
If were ever identical
Click-Clack-Pow
How you like a nigga now
In control of my domain
They can do what I allow
And I know Toronto miss me
Imma be home in a minute
Thats my city
And I run it
You just run around in it
They see me out in person
And say I aint heard you sing yet
The world is my playground
Dont fuck with my swinggg-set
We get to pitching
And thats when it gets to piling
Im calling your bluff
Dont act like you cant see me dialing
Im in
Low-Cut Louies
With them hard denim jeans
And a beige jacket
Hands down the best in my age bracket
Holla at meSometimes I feel like Lohan and Hilary Duff
Are the only ones with enough
To feel what Im about to say in this song
When they want you to be like somebody else
And you just wanna be yourself
And you do it and get the feeling its wrong
It is when all the press articles happening
And the cameras get to snappin
And they try to make you out as a lie
Symbolic cos you were just trying to please em
By using logic and reason
Its a lose lose why even try
When your ideas so frequently get rejected and people just get neglected
And They never really know how to feel
Phone calls is something that youre expecting
For someone without ethics to try and make em a mill
You never noticed the fact you might be working what Im receivin at first
And niggas wanna say that you aint around
I mean theres always some blame to put on yourself yourselves
Instead of claimin that you couldnt help and maybe next time you were aint In town
Chorus
You gonna try to try harder cos
Try harder cos
Try -Try-Try-Try
And the managers make you circum to pressure
And you spitin the pressure than most of the rappers running the game
Concerned that people who copy whats in the past
And turn the profit to cash
Theres time I would have done it the same
I mean I got me a range
Also got me a guilty conscience
That made you tell anybody I meet that I ran
Sometimes I wish that I woulda just chilled on the sneakers
And watched the game from the bleachers
Cos Im really telling me what I spent
In a house that I promised to get my mother
Dont compensate for the other time
I wasted late out at the club
Instead of sitting in once a week for some dinner
I working hard on the winner so this album is a labour of love
You say as long as Im staying out of the streets
And just spending money on beats that
She can rest without a toss and a turn
Cos she know that my reputation perceives me
And people watch me on TV
Thats exactly why I often get burned
But Im gonna try toYeah This Dedicated To Canada Man
The Whole Up North
A Lot Of People Dont Realize How Cold It Gets During The Winter
But Listen
I Met This New Girl Late June Or Early July
I Called Her A Bunch Of Times But She Barely Replied
Now Its December Im Driving And Shes Like Wheres My Hi
I Swear That I Never Called You Cause I Really Get Shy
See That Was A Segue I Believe The Matter
Is What Happens After The Season Where The Leaves Just Scatter
Where The Timb Laces Get Tighter And Parka Hoods Flip Up
Drugs Dealers Standin And They Parka Hoods Slip Up
Where Girls Become Exes From Summers Caught Hoin
The Winter Cars Come Out The Summer Cars Go In
And Some Places Is Breezy And Some It Start Snow-Ing
And If You Planning Family Vacations You Better Know When
But Some Mothers Scared To Send They Daughters Out The City
Instead She Get A Sweater That She Bought Her Out Of Pity
Cause Mom Stays Up Late She Seen Them Videos
Where Cancun College Students Pouring Water On Their Titties
Yeah Man Its A Funny Thing Going Through The Winter Up Here Man
A Lot Of Girls Yknow Wanna Get Close You Might Think They The One
But Just Wait Nah Mean Take It Slow
Forgot To Mention This Girl That Never Gets To The Beach
She Lives Just West Of My Street And So We Destined To Meet
Since Im Driving I Ask Her How To Get The Suite
She Doesnt Answer Opens The Door And Just Gets In The Seat
She Throws Her Bag In The Back And Starts Adjusting The Heat
Shes Bold But I Roll With It Im Impressed Cause Shes Sweet
Then She Says I Heard Your Song And Im Obsessed With The Beat
I Mean The Lyrics Are Cool But Im Obsessed With The Beat
I Love It When Voyce Sings And The Chorus Is Good
Theres A Couple Things In The Song That I Suggest You Repeat
Off This Im Kinda Takin aback For A Second
I Get Her Number She Tells Me To Call Her After This Session
And So I Do And Its Kind Of Awkward The Surface Hard To Scratch
Until We End Up Sexin And Now My Heart Attached
Im Thinkin Off I Shouldve Been More Southern
And Realizing All That She Wanted Was That Indoor Lovin And Ho
Yeah Uh I Told Yall I Had A Story For You Right
Uh Ya Man Its What It Is
And Now Im Proud To Have Her Like Montreal To The Frizzench
She Love To Play Hurt Like Carter Did On The Bizzench
But My Boy Say Im Actin Different Because I Lay Downtown
And I Still I Rush To Pick Her Up From Work And Fizzench
She Tellin Everyone Imma Hold Here Down
Tell Everyone Im The Prince Up In This Cold Clear Town
And Stupid Me I Just Listen To Her
Instead Of Wondering If This Is Really Gon Last Me The Whole Year Round
But Then Spring Shows Up And Its Dallas In This Bitch
The Weather Starts To Resemble The Holidays She Missed
When We Were Together It Seeming Like Way Back When
Ball Players Hop On The Plane And Make It Way Back In
See She Used To Play Piana And Now She Never Wait For Santa
Instead Of Saving For Marriage She Saving For Carrabanna
And Its A Shame She Had Me Convinced That She Couldve Been A Dime
I Guess I Lost Another One To The Wintertime
I Miss You Most Of Aaaallll Myy Daarling
Gimme A Second To Gather My Thoughts
Strolling In The Park And Watching Winter Turn To Spring Such A Beautiful Day Man
Yeah Man You Know We Had To Switch It On em Right
Strolling In The Park And Watching Winter Turn To Spring
Im Still Standing On Two Feet Even After This Tragic Loss
Man But I Got Something To Else To Tell Ya Baby
I Remember Them Encore Pms Breakfast And The Wake Up
Now Drakes Committed We Waiting On The Breakup
So We Can Get Back To Them Cognac Nights
With Dress Codes And Light Skinned Girls That Wont Act Right
And I Laugh Cause My Previous Lifestyle Was Quite Wild
The Winter Came And Blew His Cold Air Through
Back Then Light Sweaters And A Couple Drinks Might Get Her
By The End Of The Week I Would Know Their Crew
And Wed Assembled A Trio A Whole New Scene
With Three Ladies In The Shot We Never Broke Routine
At The End Of that wed Cut When The Cameras Are Rollin
We Had Ladies Hearts Always Gettin Damaged And Stolen
But This Summer Is Different Its A Two Man Operation
Granted The Fact That We One Man Short
Got Love For Him He Can Watch This New Man Stop A Nation
Cause Handin Them Crack Is A One Man Sport
Instead Of Dress-Up I Walk In Sweat Pants And Charms Clinkin
I Find A Girl We Step Dance And Calm Drinkin
The Face The Breast The Bras The Toes
Im Still Solo And A Long Night Draws To A Close
Cause Its A Fact If She Come To The Crib And I Get Some Ass Inside
Well Never Talk Again Scary And True
That Song Special I Recorded With Voyce Well Its Like A Classified
Its What Im Lookin For To Carry Me Through
Yet I Cant Seem To Find A every Girl That Possesses It
Only Wants A Friendship Causing Me To Forget The Shit
And When They Talk About They Past And Lovers
And You Get Mad At The Though Of her Giving Ass To Others
Yet You Find Peace With Yourself Now Least Theres Some Room To Ride
Theres Also Room For Improvement As Soon As June Arrive
Strolling In The Park And Watching Winter Turn To Spring
Strolling In The Park And Watching Winter Turn To Spring
Strolling In The Park And Watching Winter Turn To SpringRIP to the girl you used to see
Her days are over Baby shes over

Drake - Verse

flash black lines aray white diamonds what a contrast
i know you get impatient as the time pass you say you want it fast
define fast cause i can speed it up and make it last
and i could audition for this and i could be part of the cast
and i could produce for your future i could co-direct your past
and make damn sure you never forget it commited im ready im with it
still here like a statue pink champagne green ink in your tattoos
you say you got bagges well im packed too plus i got a sex pistol
pointed right at you BAM the baddest women ever in the heart of south
proven over and over again thats why im hard to doubt plus im
young money till the death i took the carter route
im more than ready too hope of something that you thought about

You getting ready so I know we gon be here awhile
in the bathroom flat irons and nail files
spending hours in salons on your hairstyles
in the mall steady racking up the air miles
hit the gym step on the scales stare at the number
you say you dropping ten pounds preparing for summer
and you dont do it for the man men never notice
you just do it for yourself youre the f-cking coldest
intelligent too ooh youre my sweetheart
Ive always liked my women book and street smart
long as they got a little class like half days
and the confidence to overlook my past ways
time heals all and heels hurt to walk in
but they go with the clutch that you carry your lip gloss in
and look I really think that nobody does it better
I love the way you put it together

Well arent you a breath of fresh air
from all these superficial gold digging bitches in here
they get a baller think that they aint got to pick a career
guess they plan on sucking somes d-cks until some millions appear
Voila you do it right he might just buy you a car
unless you play these suckers just like BoB play the guitar
now here you are with your girls having drinks at the bar
I say Im buying you declining I think thats kinda bizarre
independant with the demeanor of an RnB singer
make it rain finger check
Mthree beamer check
Champagne range
triple white Caddy
closet full of brand new clothes and hand bags
Alexander McQueen Prada Gucci Chanel
DG BCBG Versace Louie and Bebe
Ya dont need it greedy or easy as these other breezys
who f-ck for balls or reason

As we proceed
Drake
Uh five and a half and boys
ass is off the hook
cinderella bout to lose the glass off her foot
and when I find it is when I find you
and we can do hte things we never got the time to
better late than never
but never late is better
they tell me time is money well well spend it together
Im down for whatever
you just lead the way
we go to dinner you dont even look at me to pay
mature women with more than me were the first to tempt me
and Jason had this girl Tammy with a purple Bentley
how she got it I aint never get to ask
I just knew that she was fine like a ticket on the dash
yeah but shout out to the homeowners
the girls that got diplomas
and enough money to loan us a little something extra
should we ever need it
if it sounds like you then let me hear you repeat it
ChorusCheck look
And I aint tryna get to know nobody but you
Do me a favor tell me whats happenin
I am drinkin XO D is sippin some Appleton
Usually the things I desire I always apprehend
Back again return of the mack again
Deceiving was cool Ill never record the track again
Even though my ex is fuckin one of my rapper friends
I dont wanna seem like I am always attacking them verbally
You can stop frontin I know you heard of me
Babygirl ya ya ya heard of me
Little me
Pay attention I guarantee you itll be
One of the best decisions youve made
Im sonnin them all I live in the shade
Previously mischievous behaviour was the leader of me
You could say I was fresh to some conceited degree
Steppin out the house tryna figure out where cameras from Cheaters would be
But now I need a culprit
I am talkin Long Sands Beach condo adult shit
I am talkin all day shoppin sprees in the mall with
Friends that I ball with
Hear me Treys girl Go and get you some Fall shit
Sweetie I am a tracks demise
I will kill this song til it actually dies
With a military jacket and some packed supplies
I wont say Im the best til the stats arrive
And all these a-list parties you fraternize
Where you cant wear hats inside its only slacks and ties
But you dont never act surprised
You just hold it down for your boy til the plaques arrive
And girl I used to blow a couple thousand at the shake joint
Now it cost a couple thousand for a Drake joint
I gave up a lot to make a progress

They say we killin em all all all all
Drake verse one
Hip hops newest and youngest acquisition
If this was you I wonder what youd do in that position
Try to make a profit or try to make a difference
Try to make em play your shit or try to make em listen
I go from records with Dwele and LB and Elzhi
The meetings where they tell me to start making records and that Theyll buy
Now Im out in A-Town
They tellin me Trey sound
Its too mainstream if I plan on me stickin around
But the allure of this years Scream Tour has been cuttin all them Jawns that be hurtin the game
I be dreamin bout hoes and doin them live shows
Shirtless thats why I started to personal train
Dog personally mane
Im a person that came to bring purpose to a seem unless they Purpose is game
It never feel like its earned when you purchase the fame
Now my thoughts gettin deeper and Im searchin the game
I keep on on on on on
Drake Saukrates chorus
Yeah Im killin em all all all all
Yeah Im killin em all all
Im killin em all all
Saukrates verse two
Yeah
Let me show you how to blast up
Now tell me who is a masta
A mind never wasted
Who grows fasta
The young and incredible while lightin yo ass up
You look a lil red we gettin that cash up
See where we from
The fiftys are bloody and the one hundred dollar bill is dirty brown they love Me
I mess up my livin room and studio with my money
A G-note is purple grape juice stains on the front piece of
My lapel is custom made
You off the rack shit
Im off the chain come on
The dogs are loose
And yeah we get our dumb on like San Frisco Bay
With forty and Mac Dre
Eat it or forever lose a piece of your meal to me or one of my folk
Drakell give you the deal
If bein broke at thirty is a nigga that kills
I guess we somethin like two ice bergs huntin to kill
Keep on keep on Uh keep on Uh keep on Uh
Drake Saukrates chorus
Yeah Im killin em all all all all
Yeah I m killin em all all
Im killin em all all
Drake verse three
Look uh
I used to get em like murda murda
Ol time killin
I wasnt even rappin spent my whole time chillin
And now the girls like
Its only Drake got chased and so the artists I respected try and Take my place
But pimpin aint easy man and neither is rappin
They one in the same when you need it to happen
My city full of players they just needed a captain
In need of him right now in need of him back then
But back then I was actin
Nowadays I serve backhands with backspin
Tryin to prove rappers are intelligent black men
Whoever chose to back out is back in
They say theres two sides to every story and three when the truth Get told
So grab a spoon fore your soup get cold
When you drive it off the lot is when your coupe get old
So please discover an answer fore proof gets sold
And keep on on on on on
Drake Saukrates chorus
Yeah Im killin em all all all all
Im killin em all allVerse one
Im performin tonight you know that shit gon be packed
Pay me in advance and make sure that its exact
My ex girl Ill probably show up for the simple fact
That tomorrow she can tell all of her friends it was whack
But fuck that though this about me
They say my whole fan base is missing ID
But the young trend setting musician I be
Got critics giving up the recognition I de-serve
Never bring yo misses By me Im it Im it call me Mr IT
If I get one wish Imma wish to die free
They say gon head ball like Mrs Ivory And I do
The realest in my age group no shit
Soho Cosmo Bah Mar blow fish
Lets make a toast tell yo friends come closer
Drinks on me like a coaster
Chorus
We doin it big
Look at what I done
Look at where Im is
Its only just begun
Cause I was staying home
When they was having fun
So please dont be surprised when they announce that I won
And this is how my speech goes
I deserve this shit I deserve this shit I deserve this shit
Thats all I got to say at the top is where I stay
And tell my haters never go away
The Winner
Long awaited hated
Fans see me out and they holla happy belated
Its about time that you made it
I was bumping yo songs when nobody else played it
When I was up in Hot Beat in Atlanta steady giving daps
Fetching niggas drinks but I never got to rap
If anybody asked though I prolly woulda snapped
But I cant sign nothing til my lawyer get the fax and
No one decides who the definition of talent is
And Mrs Murry look at what my talent did
And what yo business is
Its been a couple years
Guess its not about who you know its just how you balance it
Its always awkward to dummy a nigga artist
And get on someone song when you know you comin the hardest
Its how you start actin when nobody can reach ya
My plan just hatched happy Easter
Chorus
Im doin it big
Look at what I done
Look at where Im is
Its only just begun
Cause I was staying home
When they was having fun
So please dont be surprised when they announce that I won
And this is how my speech goes
I deserve this shit I deserve this shit I deserve this shit
Thats all I got to say
At the top is where I stay
And tell my haters never go away
The Winner
Uhh ok I do it for the love
Bunk bed flow always one level above
If Im in ya starting five you will never need a sub
And Im neva looking down so I always know wassup
A lot of people sayin fuck me
Problem is they be telling everybody but me
But I always got a Starbucks verse
Being brewed too hot please please double cup me
They never gave me support like Chuck Tis
And I never trust a nigga sayin trust me
Nick Cannon and Will never did it this ill
So you tell dont you dare interrupt me
Thanks to my mother for never giving up
You deserve the world now gon live it up
Thanks to uncle Steve my hero who always saved us
I could never give back everything you gave us
Bridge
And to my dad even though we was apart
I couldnt leave you out you forever in my heart
Yeah and in the name of Evelyn Cher
Ill forever forgive anybody that never was there
For me no other woman could ever compare
My angel I hope Heavens prepared for whenever you there
Uhh I got a revolutionary flow in every scenario coming through ya Stereo
Got a new chick booty round like the merry go
Bitches like where he at they be like there he go
And this verse deserve a burial
Dont cry for me this aint mothafucking Mario
Yeah and Polow isnt at my session
Its the anticipation keeping everybody guessing like
Chorus
Look at what I done

Cause I was staying home

So please dont be surprised when they announce that I won
And this is how my speech goes
I deserve this shit I deserve this shit I deserve this shit
Thats all I got to say
At the top is where I stay
And tell my haters never go away
The WinnerCan I can I save you from you
Cause you know theres something missing
And that champagne youve been sippins
Not supposed to make you different all the time
Its starting to feel like the wrong thing to do girl
Cause with all that recognition it gets hard for you to listen
To the things that I must say to make you mine
But live girl have some fun girl well be fine
Trying to convince myself Ive found one
Making the mistake I never learned from
I swear I always fall for your type yeah for your type
Tell me why I always fall for your type for your type
I just cant explain this shit at all fall for your type
I just cant explain this shit at all fall for your type
I believe in people like you
So who am I to judge you on the past girl
I bet theres a reason for it all
You say that youre nothing like the last girl
I just pray that you dont let me down right now
Its too late Im already yours
You just gotta promise me hearts wont break
And end up like before
I swear I always fall for your type yeah for your type
Tell me why I always fall for your type for your type
Look dress hanging off your shoulder barely sober
Telling me how you moving away and starting over
Girl quit playing you just drunk you just saying shit
Oh you dance dance like how like ballet and shit
Oh wait no I get it girl Im with it
Ive been down this road before and yeah I skidded but forget it
Damn yeah I wonder why I never learned my lesson
Its feeling like the second chance and its the first impression
And I heard its nothing new except for someone new
But how you supposed to find the one when anyone will come with you
Talking to myself but I never listen
Cause man its been a while and I swear that this ones different
Thats why Imma take you anywhere you wanna go
Let you meet my friends so they can lecture me again about
How reckless I have been
And Im slowly running out of all the time that I invest in
Making all the same mistakes
And Im just trying to correct it and I fall
I swear I always fall for your type for your type
Tell me why I always fall for your type for your type
I just cant explain this shit at all fall for your type
I just cant explain this shit at all fall for your type
I believe in people like youIm tryin do it all tonight
I got plans
I got a certain lust for life
And as it stands
Everything is going as right
As it can
They tryin to shoot down my flight
Before it lands
Before it lands
But you could miss me with all that
Diss me then crawl back
I really wish yall will fall back
But gettin rich suppose to slove that
And these days women make offers and who the hell am I to say
No no no
My ex send late night text cause she dont know how to let
Go go go
She in love
And as for them pretty light skinned models standin in the cold oh yea they with us
Let them girls in for a drink
And Im all in they ear
Saying she should be the one I see
Everytime that Im here but when am I really even here
Black surburban wit the tent on it
Fresher than a pillow with a mint on it
The game got these old hand prints on it
But ima be the one to pour cement on it
And start over
And show up in an Mars yellow tux
I dont really give a fuck
And we only getting older
So what i tend to do is to think of today as the past
Its funny when u coming in first but you hope that you last
You just hope that it last
that it last
that it last
that it last
that it last

Throw your ones up in the air for her
Throw your ones up in the air
Throw your ones upVerse one Drake
My name is Drizzy
And I aint perfect
But I work hard
So I deserve it
And I belong
Right where you see me
Aint on the fence about it
I aint Mr Feeny
I got a decent set of manners
And a job that fills up any empty schedule or planner
And I fall in love with girls
Caught up in superficial glammer
Who dress like Sarah Jessica
And live like Princess Diana
So often they have addiction
And Im the one that will feed it
But truly youre bad enough
That you dont even really need it
You could show up to the party
On dirty public transit
And I guarantee the camera man will still be snapping candids
Of you and your possie partying
Drinking what you get handed
With your virgin island tans
All looking like you just landed
I dont really understand it
Im not sure Im comprehending
But these girls are having fun with whose ever money they spending screaming
Ive got to be unstoppable twox
Ay ay ay ay you dont like twox
My name is Weezy
Im almost perfect
And I work harder than hard working
Bizarre circus
Thats what my bars surface
Therefore I act a clown
Even when Im laying on my back Im never backing down
So over stand me
I got a condo in Miami
And my doormat is always sandy
And I run Louisiana
But Ive never pulled a hammy
And I got a condo in Atlanta
And I always wear a bandana
And when it come down to stuntin
You boys are just frontin
And Im swingin for the fence
Your girl hangin from my dick
Your girl singing to my shit like
A lo lo lollipop
She say I get that pussy wetter than a Dasani shop
And she say I pick that pussy better than her gynecologist
Hold this
Text me whenever you want some more dick
More dick
Old bitch
Young bitch
But I be like damn
All I got is one dick
Ive got to be unstoppable twox
Ay ay ay ay you dont like twoxBoy Wonder

Yall dont really like me

My flow is sittin right inside the pocket of my pants
Im still fly you cant float
Run this sht Usain Bolt
I write your favorite records
All of you seein ghosts
Twenty-thousand for a verse is our routine quote
Im gettin rich all of you stayin broke
Chillin even if Im in a goose-down coat
I cant see you through the Mosley Tribes
So I dont even flinch when you throw me high fives
They try to measure up
But there is no one my size
Whatever Forty smokin bout to lower my eyes
Beast mode on em
I never take a night off
Every single thing a na purchase is a write-off
Grounded as the runway pavement
Im takin flight off
Baby go ahead and cut the light off
Cause hes about to go in
CHORUS - Kevin Cossom
VERSE - Kevin Cossom
And Im the rookie of the year
Im bout to get my dough on

Bottle after bottle
Cause the moneys like so long
Biggest movie ever
We about to put a show on
Ima show off like Im supposed to
You can get lost I dont know you
VERSE - Drake
I hear my phone ringin when you call
I aint pickin up or entertainin them at all
Got your girl face down bangin on the wall
While you and all your homeboys hang at Lenox Mall
Hmm hmm hmm I cannot relate
Ridin with some tags that I got from out of state
Ridin with a swag that I got from outer space
Just show me whos the hottest
Ima knock him out his place
Call me Homicide Drizzy
Im bout to kill your ego
Im about my green puffin goody like Im Cee-Lo
You can go and take a glance at your hero
While a Houston stripper pole-dances in the zero

Wavin at your girl while shes smilin back at me

You tryna make a come up in my city its a given
Plus a nigga famous
Plus I got a vision
Not to mention havin bars like a mothafuckin prison
They takin too long
Their records on hold
They threatened by my presence
Cause I make em feel old
Guaranteed if they drop they braggin bout what they sold

My buddies and my fans wanna fight your rightI dont think they really ready for my wardrobe
I show up right before the store close
and blow the fee from my last four shows
I do one song and use four flows
She used to be a Christian before
And now all she wanna do is shop for Christian Dior Clothes
Like Baby those are cute I adore those
Me and the salesman build a rapport so
He understands the fact that Im spending offshore dough
Cash only transactions homie
And please no receipts the feds like to explore those
They cant audit if they dont know I bought it
Been doing it for years homie thoroughly Ive thought it
through what it do
I am currently recorded on a track admitting of my currencys imported
Were too late now its too legitimate to hit em with
a lawsuit even if those are acts that I did commit
Repeat offender
Anita Baker playin in the whip as they pull me over
My sweet surrender
I got a jewish lawyer as my lead defender
A mieskeit as they say is a legal bender
And ATF is present every regal member
The coalition who so efficient
You have to be invited or theres no admission
We know tradition
We spend money so dont try to make compete if you are in no position
I wish you would listen
I take you back to this trial
Where I am about to be home again like New Edition
My foot is just solely meant for the shoe it fits in
Used to record in a basement that Renny grew his piff in
When pops turned over keys like a new ignition
If Hov is Jordan I guess Im cool with Pippen
til I mention it I wanna play a new position
No team playin no screen settin
Because I wanna win games coach Im through assistin
The take over the breaks over nigga
And Im a keep killin em until the day that Drakes over
The waits over the tapes coming
They bullshittin but I am equipped with great plumbing
The human mentalitys so eager to hate something
I try to play it off like it aint chumpin
And its the predicament that you found Drake in
They condo that I just purchased is sound vacant
cause I have just been sittin in this cell
Thinking what I coulda done to make my first video ground breaking
And whenever Im flowing on the mic
Aside from talking bout the D Im throwin in your wife
I treat this one session as if it were my last
And I pretend tomorrow is the day Im going in for life
Like thatDirty Money
So hard to breathe this air that we call love
Aint nothing worse than the hurt we receive from love
When you get hurt by the one you living for
Pain can make you wanna love no more
Chorus
Loving you no more
I just I cant I just cant be loving you no more
I love you more than I love myself

Hurt with the heart thats bleeding slowly
So many lonely sleepless nights
Im going through hell to convince you love me
But never her approval no matter how I try
The way you talk to me but still I say I love you
Im ashamed you can see it in my eyes
Momma always told me to respect the woman
But what am I to do when her parents do not try
So many tears I cried
But all for nothing Im afraid to say
Oooooohhh
Chorus
Ive been so dependent on your love for so long
Punishment for me is trying to let go
Give it from your heart is what you taught me
Addiction to pain is what it got me
My life now its changed
My life aint the same as you are
Heartbroken to the point sometimes wanna end it
If I cant have what mean most to me
So many tears I cried
But all for nothing Im afraid to say
Chorus
Drake
Uh trying not to over think
Only cause Ive drove and I done had a lot to drink
When I wanted it blue you said we got to paint it pink
And theres pieces of ya hair still sittin in my sink
And you still got underwear thats sittin in the dryer
How come every time that youre suspicious Im a liar
You stand out I can hear you whistle in a choir
And thats the only reason you the Mrs I admire
Damn Tell me what Im gone do
Since everything Im trying to forget is all true
Me and all your main girls get along too
I would take my last dollar out and bet it on you
But ahhhhh you see the same one Im missing
Is basically the reason I became something different
And just that I remember me before
And if you could do the same baby then well be for sure
Chorus
Loving you no more
I just I cant I just cant be loving you no more
I love you more than I love myself

EndChorus Nickelus F
We looking for some j
We looking for some j
You better tuck your women cause
We looking for some j
We looking for some j
If you love em then cuff em
Cause we looking for some j
And when we come around
You know its going down
When that tour bus pull up get all the ladies in your town
Drake the pretty one
Nick the gritty one
But we the n-ggas thats surrounded when the bidies come
Pop bottles is our style you n-ggas sipping rum
Got models with smart mouths we call them pretty dumb
Take your baby home she strip to reggaeton
Make me spend all my money
Now I need a payday loan
Was born in eighty-two but ride on eighty-fours
Cause Im making loot you n-ggas making bones
The sky is the limit Im high and Im in it
School my
Ask the chickens I be mixing
This guy like a chemist
Tell haters go bankrupt and get out of my business
Yeah I shut down shops
Haters get off my balls ladies get on my jock
Know I shut down the street when I pull out the lot
Know if I go in my pocket I pull out a lot
Chorus
Look I dont ever drink no unless its cold
And if its an exclusive I got it for the soul
If you aint got the money I put your purchase on hold
Got verses for these records and that paper for the phone
Hand me mph I ask no project my people
How come all the whips you n-ggas buying get the repo
Catch me in something new that Im rolling with Nicko
Either at the crib or in the club or at the depo
Hear me though
I got the sport range you just get short changed
Yall n-ggas witness sh-t that happen and you report things
I do resort things ST Lucia four springs
And Im important so I import things
I fly in planes with six windows and short wings
My teams exactly what loyalty and support brings
Figure that you new that you must be high
We throw parties where you reside at homie
Where the f-ck are you at
ChorusChorus
i gotta make it out or move quickly cant allow the past to restrict me
but this time around they wont skip me I AM THE LAST HOPE dont hesitate
not even for a second the hustlers become an obsession
im on the front line so my weapon I AM THE LAST HOPE
Kardinall
can you imagine the last breath of Christ
the last breath of Christopher Wallace on that faithful night
the last step that martin lurther took as a man
i got the power of my world in my hand
The Microphone brings life or death in the blink of an eye
i was born to provoke those born to die
i was conceived to beat all odds like las vegas
T-dot mutherfucker watch the world rape us
great test strugglers hustler to us succeed
cross water smugglers tussel to burn weed
It meets that pressure to success in the south
niggas watchin what i say magnifin my mouth
i never take back talk i apply the force
hand blistering for many years of holding the torch
when the skin rebuilds it grows tougher then leather
so we can keep on hold it forever
my names kardinall
Chorus
i gotta make it out or move quickly cant allow the past to restrict me
but this time around they wont skip me I AM THE LAST HOPE dont hesitate
not even for a second the hustlers become an obsession
im on the front line so my weapon I AM THE LAST HOPE
Drake
Jealousy is suttin i havent felt in years theres nobody around for me to be jealous off i bet you do is showing my city and no one cheers even if you make the music that ladies and fellas love and dove im incredible often unforgettable but when it comes to records i will eat it if its editable they say the futures always for-seen thats why im steady getting more money more cream my flow is stuck in the moment that comes before a dream i stay avoiding unlucky like fourteen and people get behind and they fight for em cause he wont let no other niggas wright for em and even when its quite warm the attitude coursing through the veins and my city is an ice storm the names drake and i dont take it for granted i can take it you offended cause im taken advantage mang This here is on some truthful shit
It seems like everything I do your used to it
And I hate hearing stories bout who youve been with
Thats when I gotta hide what Im feeling inside
So you still think Im confident and damn
Is this gonna last Your up on a pedastool
Are we moving too fast
Feel like Im in crazy competition with the past
Thats why I gotta ask is anything Im doing brand new
Brand new brand new brand new brand new
Is anything Im doing brand new
Brand new brand new brand new brand new brand new
This here is something personal
Highly doubt this feeling is reversible
Knowledge is pain and that is why it hurts to know
That you attempt to hide and put mistakes aside
So I dont ever question you and damn
I cant even find the perfect brush
So I can paint whats going through my mind
Racing against myself but Im a couple steps behind
Thats why I gotta ask is anything Im doing brand new
Brand new brand new brand new brand new
Is anything Im doing brand new
Brand new brand new brand new brand new
Brand new girl
Is anything Im doing brand new
Is everything Im doing too late
Did he take off your clothes off just like this
Did he give you loving just like this
Did you spend the night in his bed on the very first date
Tell me baby am I too lateChorus
Emotions in this game run deep
So before these haters kill me in my sleep
Id like to say its been a pleasure
Reppin til my last second through
Done a lot of shit theyll never get to do
Id like to say its been a pleasure
Honored to be somebody they mention
But before these niggas stop payin attention
Ill just say its been a pleasure
Youll never be somebody they need
Tomorrow aint guaranteed
So tonight we gon do it like this
Oh for the H-Town
Tonight Im gon make some money go
For the H-Town
Ladies and gentlemen
Youre now listenin to the Dirty South trillionaire naire
Keepin it trill in there been here and hes still in there there
Pay attention its the beginnin of a new era era
Get a little closer you can see the view clearer view clearer
Its like Lasik but are basic
Ebonics if youre hooked on chronic and you can taste it
Trace it recognize the real when ya face it
Ball up in the club gettin white boy wasted
One shot of Patron then another one to chase it
Put me to the test I wont pass it Ill ace it
Been so many places up and down the interstate
Cities that Ive never been wonderin if they fin to hate
Step up in the spot let em look me in the grill grill
So they can see it for they self that I keep it trill I keep it trill
I paid the cost to be the boss and left a tip
So its all good good dont even trip
Believe me its been a pleasure
Chorus
Man Ive been all over the world
Tryin to tell em bout the trill and what we been through through
What we already done and what we fin do do
What we got into what we gettin into to
When ties bout to cut it closer than a Ginsu su
Roll through Atlanta Birmingham Alabama bama
Jacksonville to Jackson Mississippi spittin grammar spittin grammar
From Shreveport port down to New Orleans leans
And all points in between just to get the cream cream
Me and my II Trill team on the road flippin flippin
Eight hours straight no stops no trippin trippin
Had to keep them heaters on em so its no slippin slippin
Promote a play with show money we were slow grippin slow grippin
Sometimes we rock the stage and put it down down
Other times we had to fight and shoot it out of town town
But we always made it home okay
And we still on the road to this day
I gotta say its been a pleasure
Chorus
They say that you never really know
What you got til its gone and cant touch it touch it
If it look too good to be true you cant trust it trust it
If you never had it had it then you can never miss it miss it
But looks can be deceivin so dont you get it twisted twisted
Walked a lot of miles in these old school Js Js
Thought of many ways lookin at back in the days days
Like how to climb from in between a rock and a hard place
How to keep your cool when youre dealin with a hard case with a hard case
And how to duck when the judge throw the book at you the book at you
And its a two-sided mirror that youre lookin through youre lookin through
The phone receivers in your hand starin at your child child
And your heart skips a beat every time they smile smile
See thats how real life is and how it can be can be
And how its deeper then just comin down candy candy
So Im just tryin to play the cards that they hand me
For those that overstood me understand me
Its been a pleasure
Chorus
Id like to say its been a pleasure
Ill just say its been a pleasureHey there pretty girl you know exactly what you got and I dont blame you at all
You cant resist it
Especially when the lights so bright and the money so right and its comin in every single night
She dont wanna leave she just stuck in
Houstatlantavegas Houstatlantavegas Houstatlantavegas Houstatlantashe just stuck in
Houstatlantavegas Houstatlantavegas Houstatlantavegas Houstatlantavegas
And she danceto this songand she dance to this songand it go
Hey now now watch her go down
She doesnt ever worry if she wants it shell get it on her own
She knows theres more to life and shes scared of ending up alone
Throw your ones up in the air throw your ones up in the air for her
Throw your ones up in the air cause the ones you throw will get her out of
Houstatlantavegas Houstatlantavegas Houstatlantavegas Houstatlantashe just stuck in
Houstatlantavegas Houstatlantavegas Houstatlantavegas Houstatlantavegas
And she danceto this songand she dance to this songand it go
Hey now now watch her go down
We all got dreams and we all start reaching all start peaking all-star weekend

Young girls envy the life yall leading never satisfied with a nice calm evening

Ill give you the business
So button up your shirt straight
Look at where I landed
You would think I planned it

Chicks get hammered
Big dick bandit
Money flowing like a slit wrist no bandage
Blowing purple clouds nigga Im so sky high
I aint cutting anybody slices outta my pie
Outta this world though Im so Sci-fi
And I dont sit still I keep it moving like a drive-by
I just tell the truth so Im cool in every hood spot

And if I brought it in the club

Cost a few hundred bands
And Im motherfucking in it
No need for a room

And Imma be a legend even when my life end
And Imma be a legend even when this life end

We should let it be
And did you agree

Lets call the whole thing off
We just have had enough of us

But some things look better inside of the store
Chorus

Wish I had the courage to say everything I planned to
My girlfriend my girlfriend call herself my girlfriend tell me that we pose to be together till the world end
But I dont really feel that

One time for the homie DJ Screw
Already Im feelin throwed in this bitch

A cup inside a cup smokin ghost face killah

Nigga Im the man I sent your girl message
Said I see you when I can
She send me one back but I aint never read it
Cause pussies only pussy and I get it when I need it and
Im tellin you when homies runnin down in the winter
And I be riding rims with tires in it thinner
Air force stun fly charters over seas full of Don Perian
And the water for the Ds
Dont know why it happens every time we alone
But here we are again and I swear Im in my zone
So Ima sip this drink till that motherfucker gone
Than you go get undressed and we gon get it on
I dont give you the time you deserve from me
This is something I know I know I know
So tonight Ill just fuck you like were in Houston
Taking everything slow so slow so slow but I do it to her
Draped up and dripped out know what Im talkin bout
Three in the morning get it poppin in the parking lot
Its on once again and I never pretend
A nigga stay G till the end yeah
I swear like every time we find ourself in this situation
I just get that feeling like I mean Houston candy paint
Switching colors in the light its about like eleven pm

Big Mo UGK Lil Keke
It feel like everything just moving slow
Lets take my time I pace it baby

Im still shuttin cities down everytime I come around
Nigga Im still doin my thing

Responsible for everything you listen to my meteocre talent proceeds to try and condition you
Took over my city and I never asked permission to
Started poppin bottles cause its ATL tradition to celebrate it by hard
Fuck a nigga so hard
If there aint a elevator in this its a no go
Coldest thing droppin is these bitches wanna snowblow
And they just gimme head while the haters gimme promoooo
And man my dj shoulda won that
Well listen and respect mann the city owes us one bag
All these old hands keep their minds on one track
And me I run Toronto holla at me when you done laps
Roll around with nikko party with a zukka
Shot goes out the wonder shot goes out the future shot goes out the getty mutha fucka I am ready
And whoever got the torch just cant seem tuh hold it steady cause I see the flame flickerin ex girls bickerin got these women jockin me from heartlake road tuh pickerin
I tried tuh send my nigga shorts Im certefied in michigan but my connects said itll take a minute if yer listenin

Rappers are emotional critics be reviewin me but I got love for everybody even if yer suin me

Im still shuttin cities down everytime I come around
Nigga Im still doin my thing
Im still Im stillLadies make some noise if you wanna be my replacement
Let me show you what it is
I was birthed up top but was raised at the bottom of the map
Where the girls all thick and the hottest niggas rap
If you lookin for the good then we got in the trap like
Ooo wee
Took em from white snakes to
Ooo wee
This metaphor might sound a little confusing but
Yall dont really know me if you know me
I done come all way from the Days Inn and all the hotels that I stayed in
I took my lifestyle from mediocre to good and now I say its sittin at amazing
Girls tryin SoHo lobby us
Hear em all screamin then its probably is
But I cant blame females females cant really ignore something this obvious
What you really expect when I strut through town
Two or three days I shut you down
Chilin wit the homie Trey Songz
You call him the prince he rep two up two down
Anyone I know get used to me
Im far from the man that I used to be
I dont ever really kick game
I know you find it impressive whenever you introduced to me
Cause Im a good dude who take pride in that
Need good lovin Im providing that
Understand that Im worldwide
You get it how you want it wherever you be residing at
Cause I do things from the M-town
To the UK
From Spain back out to Texas
This albums for my fans
But yo this hook is for my exes
This one is for you girl
You know who you are girl
You only show your face
Cause you know that Im a star girl
What you trying to to make it
Dont ever mistake it

You know years ago they had the AR men to tell you what to play
How to play it and you know whether its disco and rock
But um we just went in the studio and we did it
We had champagne in the studio of course you know
Compliments of the company and we just laid back and did it
So we hope you enjoy listening to this album half as much
As we enjoyed playing it for you because we had a ball
Only real music is gonna last
All the other bullshit is here today and gone tomorrow
Cash rules everything around me
CREAM get the money dolla-dolla bill yall
After hours of Il Mulino
Or Sotto Sotto just talkin about women and vino
The contract like ninety-one Dan Marino
I swear this got Michael Rapino boostin my ego
Overly focused its far from the time to rest now
Debates growing bout who they think is the best now
Took a while got the jokers out of the deck now

Fuck it I dont even tint it they should know whos in it
Im authentic real name no gimmicks
No game no scrimmage I aint playin with you niggas at all
My classmates they went on to be chartered accountants
Or work with their parents but thinkin back on how they treated me
My high school reunion might be worth an appearance
Make everybody have to go through security clearance
Tables turn bridges burn you live and learn
With the ink I could murder word to my nigga Irv

Cash rules everything around me

When Im bout to drop somethin crazy and I say Im the greatest of my generation
Like I should be dressin different
Like I should be less aggressive and pessimistic
Like I should be way more nervous and less dismissive
Like I should be on my best behavior
And not talk my shit and do it major like the niggas who paved the way for us
Like I didnt study the game to the letter
And understand that Im not doin it the same man Im doin it better
Like I didnt make that clearer this year
Like I should feel I dont know guilty for saying that
They should put a couple more mirrors in here so I can stare at myself
These are usually just some thoughts that I would share with myself
But I thought Fuck it
Its worth it to share em with someone else more than Paris for once
I text her from time to time she a mom now
I guess sometimes life forces us to calm down
I told her she could live with me if she need to
I got a compound but I think shes straight
Cause she supported since Hot Beats right before Wayne came
And got me out of the backroom where I was rapping with Jas over beats I shouldnt have in the hopes for the glory
He walked right past in the hallway three months later Im his artist
He probably wouldnt remember that story
But that shit stick with me
Always couldnt believe when he called me
You never know it could happen to you

In my leather and my Timbs like its one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight
And my dog Chubby Chub thats my nigga from the way
On the east side of the city thats where everybody stay
Seem like everybody calling cause they want me on their song
Its like every time I touch it I could never do no wrong
When they need a favor from your man they dont leave you alone
But I guess thats just the motion
Then that phone doesnt ring
When they got everything thats the motion
Oh-oh I guess thats just the motion
Oh-oh I guess thats just the motion
Yeah looking back on it at least my pride is intact
Cause we said no strings attached and I still got tied up in that
Everything that I write is either for her or about her
So Im with her even when Im here without her and she know it
The girl that I wanna save is like a danger to my health
Try being with somebody that wanna be somebody else
I always thought she was perfect when she was being herself
Dont even know how to help but I guess thats just the motion
Shell probably come around
Soon as I settle down thats the motion
Oh-oh I guess thats just the motion
Oh-oh I guess thats just the motion
I guess thats just the motion
Nothing less and nothing more
I hear your heart hit the floor
I guess thats just the motion
Talking to you is not enough
I guess thats just the motion

I can tell a lie if you ask me about my whereabouts
But I might talk that real if you ask me what I care about
Reppin bitches reppin bitches bitches
And reppin reppin them bitches until all of us switches
I swear its been two years since somebody ask me who I was
Im the greatest man I said that before I knew I was
Thats whats important and what really happened before this
When me and my crew was all about this rapper from New Orleans
Singing walking like a man finger on the trigger
I got money in my pocket Im a uptown nigga ah
With fame on my mind my girl on my nerves
I was pushing myself to get something that I deserve
That was back in the days Acura days
I was a cold dude Im getting back to my ways
People always ask how I got my nice things
Take my crown to the grave Im an underground king

Cause Im down to spend whatever lately Ive been on a roll
And I do it for the city cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city cause you know the city love it a nigga
Do it for the city cause you know the city love it a nigga
Do it for the city UGK fuck these other niggas
Sometimes I need that romance sometimes I need that pole dance
Sometimes I need that stripper thats gon tell me that she dont dance
Tell me lies make it sound good make it sound good
Do me like the women from my town would
Leather with that woodgrain Persian rugs on wood floors
Talking all them good things thats all Im really good for
Memphis Tennessee no see I start to go deep back
And rich crust with my seat back with Yo Gotti and E-Mack
And these niggas got them diamonds glowing in they mouth
And they rockin furs like its snowing in the south
And every pretty girl tell me thats the shit that she like
So why am I a classic this is who Im trying to be like
So I drop out lessons I was taught are quick to fade
As soon I realize that term-end papers they wont get me paid
If I dont nothing Ima ball
Im countin all day like a clock on the wall
Yeah need that making major changes to the life Im living
I had no choice I had to prove I made the right decisions
That was back in the days Acura days
I was a cold dude Im getting back to my ways
People always ask how I got my nice things

I bet we can make tonight the greatest story ever told
Cause Im down to spend whatever lately Ive been on a roll

Dont think about it too much too much too much too much
This is more than just a new lust for you
Done saying Im done playing
Last time was on the outro
Stuck in the house need to get out more
Ive been stacking up like Im fundraising
Most people in my position get complacent
Come places with star girls end up on them front pages
Im quiet but I just ride with it
Moment I stop having fun with it Ill be done with it
Im the only one thats putting shots up
And like a potluck you need to come with it
Dont run from it like H-Town in the summer time I keep it one hundred
Lot of girls in my time there word to Paul Wall not one fronted
I was birthed there in my first year man I know that place like I come from it
Backstage at Warehouse in nine like Is Bun coming
Fuck that is any one coming fore I show up there and aint no one there
These days I could probably pack it for like twenty nights if I go in there
Back rub from my main thing Ive been stressed out
Talking to her like back then they didnt want me Im blessed now
Talking to her like this drop bet a million copies get pressed out
She tell me Take a deep breath youre too worried about being the best out
Dont think about it too much too much too much too much
Theres no need for us to rush it through
Dont think about it too much too much too much too much
This is more than just a new lust for you
Someone go tell Noel to get the Backwoods
Money got my whole family going backwards

Theres issues at hand that were not discussing
Look I did not sign up for this
My uncle used to have all these things on his bucket list
And now hes acting like oh well this is life I guess Nah fuck that shit
Listen man you can still do what you wanna do you gotta trust that shit
Heard once that in dire times when you need a sign thats when they appear
Guess since my text message didnt resonate Ill just say it here
Hate the fact my mom cooped up in her apartment telling herself
That shes too sick to get dressed up and go do shit like thats true shit
And all my family from the M-Town that Ive been round started treating me like Im him now
Like we dont know each other we aint grow together we just friends now
Shit got me feeling pinned down pick the pen up and put the pen down
Writing to you from a distance like a pen pal but weve been down
Dont think about it too much too much too much too much
Theres no need for us to rush it through
Dont think about it too much too much too much too much
This is more than just a new lust for you
Dont think about it too much too much too much too much
Theres no need for us to rush it through
Dont think about it too much too much too much too much
This is more than just a new lust for youI dont know why they been lying but yo shit is not that inspiring

Fuck any nigga thats talkin that shit just to get a reaction
Fuck going platinum I looked at my wrist and its already platinum

Oh well bitches paint OVO on their toenails
And show up at the show the afterparty and the hotel
That five star in your city they know where we at
I hit the lobby womens screaming like Jodecis back nigga
Jodecis back
You bitches screamin like Jodecis back
I call the front desk for condoms sayin they aint got none
The way that Im respondin she know that we black nigga
Jodecis back
Fuckin hoes like Jodecis back
I paint pictures and flip words
Nigga woulda thought Def Poetry backComin off the last record Im gettin twenty million off the record
Just to off these records nigga thats a record
Im livin like Im out here on my last adventure
Past the present when you have to mention
This is nothin for the radio but theyll still play it though
Cause its that new Drizzy Drake thats just the way it go
Heavy airplay all day with no chorus
We keep it thorough nigga rap like this for all of my borough niggas
I reached the point where dont shit matter to me nigga
I reached heights that Dwight Howard couldnt reach nigga
Prince Akeem they throw flowers at my feet nigga
I could go a hour on this beat nigga
Im just as famous as my mentor
But thats still the boss dont get sent for
Get hype on tracks and jump in front of a bullet you wasnt meant for
Cause you dont really wanna hear me vent more
Hot temper scary outcome
Heres a reason for niggas thats hatin without one
That always let they mouth run
Bench players talkin like starters I hate it
Started from the bottom now we here nigga we made it
Yeah Tom Ford tuscan leather smelling like a brick
Degenerates but even Ellen love our shit
Rich enough that I dont have to tell em that Im rich
Self explanatory you just here to spread the story wassup
Sittin Gucci Row like they say up at UNLV
Young rebel young money nothin you could tell me
Paperwork takin too long maybe they dont understand me
Ill compromise if I have to I gotta stay with the family
Not even talkin to Nicki communication is breakin
I dropped the ball on some personal shit I need to embrace it
Im honest I make mistakes Id be the second to admit it
Think thats why I need her in my life to check me when Im trippin
On a mission tryna shift the culture
Tell me who dissin I got some things thatll hit the culprit
Them strep throat flows them shits to stop all of the talkin
All of the talkin got one reply for all of your comments
Fuck what you think Im too busy thats why you leave a message
Born a perfectionist guess that makes me a bit obsessive
That shit I heard from you lately really relieved some pressure
Like aye B I got your CD you get an E for effort
I piece letters together and get to talkin reckless
I dont change like credentials you know you see the necklace
My lifes a completed checklist
Im tired of hearin bout who you checkin for now
Just give it time well see whos still around a decade from now
Thats real
How much time is this nigga spendin on the intro
Lately Ive been feelin like Guy Pearce in Memento
I just set the bar niggas fall under it like a limbo
The family all that matters Im just out here with my kinfolk
Off everything my pen wrote we went from bundy to winslow
This for shorty up on glen grove who love when I catch my tempo
I sip the Pora and listen to Cappadonna
The fresh prince just had dinner with Tatyana no lie
All these ninetys fantasies on my mind
The difference is that with mine they all come true in due time
I might come through without security to check if youre fine
Thats just me on my solo like fuck it like YOLO
Wanted to tell you accept yourself
You dont have to prove shit to no one except yourself
And if you end up needin some extra help then I could help
You know back on your feet and shit
Tryna get my karma up fuck the guilty and greedy shit
How much time is this nigga spendin on the intro
How this nigga workin like he got a fuckin twin though
Life is soundin crazy forty on Martin Scorcese
And I wouldnt change a thing if you paid me now real nigga wassup
How much time is this nigga spendin on the intro
As hell below Ill see you when you get there
Are you enjoying yourself
If we may wed just like to close off with something a bit inspirational
Hopefully something a bit relevant as to us all
Are having the same fears shedding similar tears
And of course dying in so many years
It dont mean that we cant have a good life
So wed like to just maybe close out with something some food for thoughtWhats up Been a minute since we kicked it youve been caught up
With them bitches I dont get it youre a star love
You shouldnt have to deal with that Id never make you feel like that
Cause I love me I love me enough for the both of us
Thats why you trust me I know youve been through more than most of us
So what are you What are you what are you so afraid of
Darling you you give but you cannot take love
Yeah I needed to hear that shit I hate when youre submissive
Passive aggressive when were texting I feel the distance
I look around the peers that surround me these niggas tripping
I like when money makes a difference but dont make you different
Started realizing a couple places I can take it
I want to get back to when I was that kid in the basement
I want to take it deeper than money pussy vacation
And influence a generation thats lacking in patience
Ive been dealing with my dad speaking a lack of patience
Just me and my old man getting back to basics
Weve been talking bout the future and time that we wasted
When he put that bottle down girl that niggas amazing
Well fuck it we had a couple Coronas
We might have rolled a white paper just something to hold us
We even talked about you and our couple of moments
He said we should hash it out like a couple of grown ups
You a flower child beautiful child Im in your zone
Looking like you came from the seventys on your own
My mother is sixty-six and her favorite line to hit me with is
Who the fuck wants to be seventy and alone
Yall dont even know what you want from love anymore
I search for something Im missing and disappear when Im bored
But girl what qualities was I looking for before
Who you settling for Who better for you than the boy hah
I love me I love me enough for the both of us
Thats why you trust me I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you What are you what are you so afraid of
Darling you you give but you cannot take love
Thinking bout Texas back when Porsche used to work at Treasures
Or further back then that before I had the Houston leverage
When I got Summer a Michael Kors with my mommas debit
A weak attempt at flexing Ill never forget it
Cause that night I played her three songs
Then we talked about something we disagreed on
Then she started telling me how Ill never be as big as Trey Songz
Boy was she wrong that was just negative energy for me to feed off
Now its therapeutic blowing money in a galleria
Or Beverly Center Macys where I discovered Bria
Landmarks to the muses that inspired the music
When I could tell it was sincere without trying to prove it
The one that I needed was Kourtney from Hooters on P Street
Ive always been feeling like she was the piece to complete me
Now she engaged to be married whats the rush on commitment
Know we were going through some shit name a couple that isnt
Remember our talk in the parking lot at the Ritz
Girl I thought we had it all planned out guess I fucked up the vision
Learning the true consequences of my selfish decisions
When you find out how Im living I just hope Im forgiven
It seems like you dont want this love anymore
Im acting out in the open its hard for you to ignore
But girl what qualities was I looking for before
Who you settling for who better for you than the boy huh
I love me I love me enough for the both of us
Thats why you trust me I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you What are you what are you so afraid of
Darling you you give but you cannot take love
Been Bocka AKA Not Nice from Timegiene been a East Side ting
Scarborough ting from time G
Been have up di ting dem from time G
So I dont know whats wrong with these lil waste mans out here eh
Yall need to know yourselfYeah this on some old Tommy Campos Dice Raw shit
For my niggas though
You underestimated greatly
Most number ones ever how long did it really take me
The part I love most is they need me more than they hate me
So they never take shots I got everybody on safety
I could load every gun with bullets that fire backwards
You probably wouldnt lose a single rapper
Niggas make threats cant hear em over the laughter
Yeah thats cause Im headed to the bank nigga
Sinatra lifestyle Im just being Frank with you
I mean where you think she at when she aint with you
Wildin doin shit thats way out of your budget
Owl sweaters inside her luggage you gotta love it
Damn this shit could go on a tape
Bitches lovin my drive I never give it a break
Give these niggas the look the verse and even the hook
Thats why every song sound like Drake featuring Drake
Straight Y pree Why is it always me
Got us watchin our words like theres wire taps on the team
Cause I show love never get the same outta niggas
Guess its funny how money can make change outta niggas
For real
Some nobody started feelin himself
A couple somebodies started killin themself
A couple albums dropped those are still on the shelf
I bet them shits would have popped if I was willin to help
I got a gold trophy from the committee for validation
Bad press during the summer over allegations
I aint lyin my nigga my time is money
Thats why I aint got time for a nigga whos time is comin
A lot of niggas PR stuntin like thats the movement
And Im the only nigga still known for the music
I swear fuck them niggas this year
I made Forbes list nigga
Fuck your list everythings lookin gorgeous
Without me rap is just a bunch of orphans
But if I stay in the shit theres a bunch of corpses
And me and my dread nigga from New Orleans
Stashin money like hoarders off multi-platinum recordings
Eat it like Im seated at Swish Sotto and Josos
Nothing Was The Same this shit for Easy and Cocoa
This shit for Kareem this shit for Jaevon
This shit for Julius Milly Mill
Boy we do this shit for real
All them boys in my will
All them boys is my Wills
Anything happen to pop and I got you like Uncle Phil
Weezy been on that edge you niggas just need to chill
If anything happen to papi might pop a nigga for real
Comin live from the screwface livin out a suitcase
But Im feelin good Johnny got me pushin two plates
My weight up I refuse to wait up I started a new race
Its funny when you think a nigga blew up after Lupe
Niggas treat me like Ive been here for ten
Some niggas been here for a couple never been here again
Im on my King James shit Im tryin to win here again
A young nigga tryin to win here again
Man whats up
Yeah a young nigga tryin to win here again
If I like her I just fly her to the city Im in
I got her drinkin with your boy
I got her fucked up shorty aw yeahWe had the type of nights where morning comes too soon
And nothing was the same
Watch me going out of the way
When I shouldve went home
Only time of the day I get to spend on my own
I was trippin off how I used to sleep at ya crib
Should drive by right where you live and pick you up on the way
We aint spoke in so long probably put me in the past
I can still get you wet and I can still make you laugh
You should call into work if that aint too much to ask
I could pour you up a drink and we can burn something
Come thru come thru come thru come thru

So get your ass in that car and come thru
Come thru come thru come thru come thru
Girl you know we got thangs to do

Last night I brought DOA to the studio
They already had a stage and a booty pole
Its supposed to be a lot of hard working going on
But who the fuck can focus with this twerkin going on
Someone put a order in for a chicken For a chicken
Told my girl to order in I need the kitchen Need the kitchen
Yeah they know I got the hook-up they just wait on me to cook up
Baby I heat up the stove you do the dishes ya know
Rap game Crack game aint that different ya know
Last album had it booming something vicious ya know
And ya know I need ya back in my life
Girl ya know ya got that know ya got that thing that I like
Girl you got that thing for real
When I was on a mission to make it
Who used to sleep on the floor with you when you lived in the basement
Who else got all the things you need at fouram when its late

Come thru come thru come thru come thru

Compliments of the company and we just laid back and did it
So we hope you enjoy listening to this album half as much
As we enjoyed playing it for you because we had a ball
Only real music is gonna last
All the other bullshit is here today and gone tomorrow
Cash rules everything around me
CREAM get the money dolla-dolla bill yall
After hours of Il Mulino
Or Sotto Sotto just talkin about women and vino
The contract like ninety-one Dan Marino
I swear this got Michael Rapino boostin my ego
Overly focused its far from the time to rest now
Debates growing bout who they think is the best now
Took a while got the jokers out of the deck now
Im holdin all the cards and niggas wanna play chess now
I hear you talkin say it twice so I know you meant it
Fuck it I dont even tint it they should know whos in it
Im authentic real name no gimmicks
No game no scrimmage I aint playin with you niggas at all
My classmates they went on to be chartered accountants
Or work with their parents but thinkin back on how they treated me
My high school reunion might be worth an appearance
Make everybody have to go through security clearance
Tables turn bridges burn you live and learn
With the ink I could murder word to my nigga Irv
Yeah I swear shit just started clickin dog
You know its real when you are who you think you are
Cash rules everything around me
CREAM get the money dolla-dolla bill yall
Cash rules everything around me
CREAM get the money dolla-dolla bill yall
Uh I had Benzes fore you had braces
The all black Maybach but Im not a racist
Insides whiter than Katy Perrys face is
Yellow diamonds in my JesÃºs
I just might learn to speak Mandarin
Japanese for the yen that Im handlin
International Hov thats my handle
My saints Sean Don light a candle
El Gran Santo on the mantle
Case yall didnt know I speak Spanish too
Shoutout to Worldwide Wes
Everywhere we go we leave a worldwide mess

A pair of Jordan threes tryna chase this cash
Gucci air bag just in case we crash
Uh last night was mad trill
Im fresh out of Advil Jesus grab the wheel
Yeah uh look fuck all that happy to be here shit that yall want me on
Im the big homie they still be tryna lil bro me dog
Like I should fall in line like I should alert niggas
When Im bout to drop somethin crazy and I say Im the greatest of my generation
Like I should be dressin different
Like I should be less aggressive and pessimistic
Like I should be way more nervous and less dismissive
Like I should be on my best behavior
And not talk my shit and do it major like the niggas who paved the way for us
Like I didnt study the game to the letter
And understand that Im not doin it the same man Im doin it better
Like I didnt make that clearer this year
Like I should feel I dont know guilty for saying that
They should put a couple more mirrors in here so I can stare at myself
These are usually just some thoughts that I would share with myself
But I thought Fuck it
Its worth it to share em with someone else more than Paris for once
I text her from time to time she a mom now
I guess sometimes life forces us to calm down
I told her she could live with me if she need to
I got a compound but I think shes straight
Cause she supported since Hot Beats right before Wayne came
And got me out of the backroom where I was rapping with Jas over beats I shouldnt have in the hopes for the glory
He walked right past in the hallway three months later Im his artist
He probably wouldnt remember that story
But that shit stick with me
Always couldnt believe when he called me
You never know it could happen to you
And I just spent four Ferraris all on a brand new Bugatti
And did that shit cause its something to do yeah
I guess its just who I became dog
Nothing was the same dogYeah isnt it amazing how you talk all this shit and we still lack communication
How beautiful our kids will be girl I dont need convincing
How every conversation starts with this time will be different oh
Oh the ideas fun
Oh the ideas fun
Oh the idea is so fun every time
At least we try for home run every time
Swangin eyes closed just swangin
Same city same friends if youre looking for me
Same city same friends if youre looking
Ill be here just swangin
Dont talk to me like Im famous
And dont assume cause I dont expect assumptions babe
Im just tryna connect with somethin babe yeah swangin eh
She just wanna run around the city and make memories that she can barely remember
And Id allow her talk about pussy power
Yea she just wanna run over my feelings
Like she drinkin and drivin in an eighteen wheeler and Id allow her
Talk about pussy power
She used to say You can be whoever you want even yourself
Yeah I show up knowin exactly who I was and never leave as myself
But when it falls apart Im always still down
To pick a million tiny little pieces off the ground
Cause you would learn to love people and use things and not the other way around
Swangin eyes closed just swangin
Same city same friends if youre looking for me
Same city same friends if youre looking
Ill be here just swangin eh
Dont talk to me like Im famous eh
And dont assume cause I dont expect assumptions babe
Im just tryna connect with somethin babe Ill be here just swangin
I remember when my schedule was as flexible as she is
She call and tell me be here before the sun up I be dressed before we hung up
I take Eglinton to four hundred and one east and
Exit at Markham road in the east end
Where all the pretty girls are sleeping
My license been expired I renew it after the weekend
Fuck I know I said that shit the last seven weekends
Girl I guess procrastination is my weakness
I hate stoppin for gas this late cause this niggas creepin and I like how were creepin
Summer is comin know you could feel it
twenty on pump whatever I aint got enough to fill it
Wont knock on your door
My uncle say You drive my whip like its yours
I got the pedal to the floor
Im on my motherfuckin way swangin
Dont fall asleep on me hang in there
Ill be there just swangin
Ill be there just swangin
I treat you good girl like youre famous
I know Im late its always the same shit
But dont fall asleep on me hang in there
Im on the road right now swangin girlI just love when Im with you yeah this shit is on ten
We used to be friends girl and even back then
You would look at me with no hesitation and youd tell me baby its yours
Nobody elses yeah this shit belong to nobody its yours
Nobody elses yeah this shit belong to nobody and that
What made me think about the game girl
And how I switched it up with a new thang
Young nigga came through on his Wu-Tang
And nowadays when I ask about who got it they say its yours
Nobody elses yeah this shit belong to nobody its yours
Nobody elses yeah this shit belong to nobody its yours
Its yours thats for sure
How you feel about coming home with a nigga for the night
If you nervous hit the lights I know we only fucking out of spite
Cause your man dont do you right do you right I could fuck you so good
Then I hit you with the nine am in Dallas who you like baby who you like
Machine gun raps for all my niggas in the back
Stadium packed just glad to see the city on the map
I just gave the city life it aint about who did it first
Its about who did it right niggas looking like Preach
Open cases on me for a half a million each
I find peace knowing that its harder in the streets
I know luckily I didnt have to grow there
I would only go there cause theres niggas that I know there
I dont know whats getting into me
I just like the rush when you see your enemy somewhere in the club
And you realize he just not in a position to reciprocate your energy
You aint ever worried cause hes not who he pretends to be
People like Mazin who was a best friend to me
Start to become a distant memory
Things change in that life and this life started lacking synergy
And fucking with me mentally I think its meant to be
Paranoid always rolling with my mothafuckin boys
But you gotta understand when its yours
They dont really leave your ass with a mothafuckin choice man
I just love when Im with you yeah this shit is on ten
We used to be friends girl and even back then
You would look at me with no hesitation and youd tell me baby its yours
Nobody elses yeah this shit belong to nobody its yours
Nobody elses yeah this shit belong to nobody and that
What made me think about the game girl
And how I switched it up with a new thang
Young nigga came through on his Wu-Tang
And nowadays when I ask about who got it they say its yours
Nobody elses yeah this shit belong to nobody its yours
Nobody elses yeah this shit belong to nobody its yours
Its yours thats for sureYeah

But I still take my time man I guess Im just old fashioned
Wearing retro shit thats old fashion
Nigga see what Im saying no closed caption

I plead the fifth drink a fifth
Load the nine leave you split in the half smoke a half need a zip
My new girl is on Glee and shit probably making more money than me and shit
I swear to God I got ninety-nine problems but a bitch aint one
I got ninety-nine problems getting rich aint one
Like I got trust issues Im sorry for the people Ive pushed out
Im the type to have a bullet-proof condom and still gotta pull out
But thats just me and I aint perfect I aint a saint but I am worth it
If its one thing I am worth it niggas still hating but it aint working

Girls love to fuck with your conscience
Girls hate when niggas go missing and shawty you aint no different
These days its hard to meet women
Feel like my love life is finished
Ive been avoiding commitment
Thats why Im in this position
Im scared to let somebody in on this
No new friends no no no
You know how this shit go
You got your fair share of admirers that call your phone
You try to act like its just me but Im not alone
But if youre alone then say my name say my name
Say my name say my name
When no one is around you
Say Baby I love you
If you aint running games
Say my name say my name
You actin kinda shady baby
Why the sudden change
Say my name

Cause those other men are practice
And this aint no time for actin

And this aint no time for uncertainty
And this aint no time for locking your phone and not coming home
and startin some shit when Im in the zone
This is why Ive been saying
No new friends no no no
You know how this shit goes
This is not four years ago
Time escapes me
Now forget how it felt when this shit move slow
I come through in whips that make a young boy take the long way home
All my young boys round me saying Get money and fuck these hoes
Where we learn these values I do not know what to tell you
Im just trying to find a reason not to go out every evening
I need someone thatll help me think of someone besides myself
I need someone I leave through the front door with
Cause we dont wanna hide no more and plus your not shy no more
Neither one of us wanna play the side no more
No Im not alone
Even though nothing was the same
Let me get your ass alone
Let me make you say my name
Say my name

DrakeGood God Almighty like back in the old days
You know years ago they had the AR men to tell you what to play
How to play it and you know whether its disco and rock
But um we just went in the studio and we did it
We had champagne in the studio of course you know
Compliments of the company and we just laid back and did it
So we hope you enjoy listening to this album half as much
As we enjoyed playing it for you because we had a ball
Only real music is gonna last
All the other bullshit is here today and gone tomorrow
Cash rules everything around me
CREAM get the money dolla-dolla bill yall
After hours of Il Mulino
Or Sotto Sotto just talkin about women and vino
The contract like ninety-one Dan Marino
I swear this got Michael Rapino boostin my ego
Overly focused its far from the time to rest now
Debates growing bout who they think is the best now
Took a while got the jokers out of the deck now
Im holdin all the cards and niggas wanna play chess now
I hear you talkin say it twice so I know you meant it
Fuck it I dont even tint it they should know whos in it
Im authentic real name no gimmicks
No game no scrimmage I aint playin with you niggas at all
My classmates they went on to be chartered accountants
Or work with their parents but thinkin back on how they treated me
My high school reunion might be worth an appearance
Make everybody have to go through security clearance
Tables turn bridges burn you live and learn
With the ink I could murder word to my nigga Irv
Yeah I swear shit just started clickin dog
You know its real when you are who you think you are
Cash rules everything around me
CREAM get the money dolla-dolla bill yall
Cash rules everything around me
CREAM get the money dolla-dolla bill yall
Uh I had Benzes fore you had braces
The all black Maybach but Im not a racist
Insides whiter than Katy Perrys face is
Yellow diamonds in my JesÃºs
I just might learn to speak Mandarin
Japanese for the yen that Im handlin
International Hov thats my handle
My saints Sean Don light a candle
El Gran Santo on the mantle
Case yall didnt know I speak Spanish too
Shoutout to Worldwide Wes
Everywhere we go we leave a worldwide mess

Im fresh out of Advil Jesus grab the wheel
Yeah uh look fuck all that happy to be here shit that yall want me on
Im the big homie they still be tryna lil bro me dog
Like I should fall in line like I should alert niggas
When Im bout to drop somethin crazy and I say Im the greatest of my generation
Like I should be dressin different
Like I should be less aggressive and pessimistic
Like I should be way more nervous and less dismissive
Like I should be on my best behavior
And not talk my shit and do it major like the niggas who paved the way for us
Like I didnt study the game to the letter
And understand that Im not doin it the same man Im doin it better
Like I didnt make that clearer this year
Like I should feel I dont know guilty for saying that
They should put a couple more mirrors in here so I can stare at myself
These are usually just some thoughts that I would share with myself
But I thought Fuck it
Its worth it to share em with someone else more than Paris for once
I text her from time to time she a mom now
I guess sometimes life forces us to calm down
I told her she could live with me if she need to
I got a compound but I think shes straight
Cause she supported since Hot Beats right before Wayne came
And got me out of the backroom where I was rapping with Jas over beats I shouldnt have in the hopes for the glory
He walked right past in the hallway three months later Im his artist
He probably wouldnt remember that story
But that shit stick with me
Always couldnt believe when he called me
You never know it could happen to you
And I just spent four Ferraris all on a brand new Bugatti
And did that shit cause its something to do yeah
I guess its just who I became dog
Nothing was the same dogSomewhere between psychotic and iconic
Somewhere between I want it and I got it
Somewhere between Im sober and Im lifted
Somewhere between a mistress and commitment
But I stay down girl I always stay down
Get down have her lay down
Promise to break everybody off before I break down
Everyone just wait now
So much on my plate now
People I believed in they dont even show they face now
What they got to say now
Nothin they can say now
Nothin really changed but still they look at me a way now
What more can I say now
What more can I say now
You might feel like nothin was the same

Drake
I should let you fall in love with
Someone else girl
I live in LA
You in Chicago
Youre not patient
Im not patient
We shouldnt be together
I think we shouldnt be together
No more no no more no
Just think Im where it all beginning
Youre the envy of your prince
Plus you know youre not yourself anymore
The miracle of change
But if we got together it will never be the same like before girl
And Im sorry
I said Im sorry girl
yeah
She said look me in my fucking eyes and say it
But tell me am I wrong for what Im saying
Is it wrong of me to tell these women what they wanna hear
Try to control us
You wanna hold us down
Yeah you really wanna hold us down
Yeah you really wanna hold us
All I asked is for a chance to prove that money cant really make me happy
Crazy how I blew myself from fucked up predicaments
I mean women inspire me to great things
Drake but always end up preventing me from achieving them
I need to grow some fucking confidence
And why you gotta say the last word
And if I tell you how I really felt
there probably end up being another argument candy girl
You know everything you thought of me came from yourself
Yeah
And that shit starts to get old
And I dont mean to say the most
But you know how they say you are who you hang with
SO IT BOTHERS ME WHEN YOU HANG WITH HOES
Drake
Is it wrong of me to tell these women what they wanna hear
You know how they say
If you love somebody
That dont love you back
Love them anywayGood God Almighty like back in the old days
You know years ago they had the AR men to tell you what to play
How to play it and you know whether its disco and rock
But um we just went in the studio and we did it
We had champagne in the studio of course you know
Compliments of the company and we just laid back and did it
So we hope you enjoy listening to this album half as much
As we enjoyed playing it for you because we had a ball
Only real music is gonna last
All the other bullshit is here today and gone tomorrow
Cash rules everything around me
CREAM get the money dolla-dolla bill yall
After hours of Il Mulino
Or Sotto Sotto just talkin about women and vino
The contract like ninety-one Dan Marino

No game no scrimmage I aint playin with you niggas at all
My classmates they went on to be chartered accountants
Or work with their parents but thinkin back on how they treated me
My high school reunion might be worth an appearance
Make everybody have to go through security clearance
Tables turn bridges burn you live and learn
With the ink I could murder word to my nigga Irv
Yeah I swear shit just started clickin dog
You know its real when you are who you think you are
Cash rules everything around me
CREAM get the money dolla-dolla bill yall
Cash rules everything around me

When Im bout to drop somethin crazy and I say Im the greatest of my generation
Like I should be dressin different
Like I should be less aggressive and pessimistic
Like I should be way more nervous and less dismissive
Like I should be on my best behavior
And not talk my shit and do it major like the niggas who paved the way for us
Like I didnt study the game to the letter
And understand that Im not doin it the same man Im doin it better
Like I didnt make that clearer this year
Like I should feel I dont know guilty for saying that
They should put a couple more mirrors in here so I can stare at myself
These are usually just some thoughts that I would share with myself
But I thought Fuck it
Its worth it to share em with someone else more than Paris for once
I text her from time to time she a mom now
I guess sometimes life forces us to calm down
I told her she could live with me if she need to
I got a compound but I think shes straight
Cause she supported since Hot Beats right before Wayne came
And got me out of the backroom where I was rapping with Jas over beats I shouldnt have in the hopes for the glory
He walked right past in the hallway three months later Im his artist
He probably wouldnt remember that story
But that shit stick with me
Always couldnt believe when he called me

Of the superstar status I elevate the grind
My time is money so I put some money on my time
Lightning on the brightening so exciting when you see the shine
Were on the level those before us never even thought of
I broke my bread and fed my team just like the Holy Father
I helped the blind to see it kept it G just like I ought to
The only thing thats left for us to do is walk on water
We playin all four quarters till the clock expire
So till I see the ref wavin I will not retire
My flow is still official and I still got the fire
Cant take your eyes off me like when you watch The Wire
And in oh-ten we finna go in
So let the opposition know that there is no win
And I am no friend so put your hand down
And tell em stand down before its man down
Uh since youre tellin on me tell the world about me
Ask your girl about me shell probably tell you that I

But understand nothing was done for me
So I dont plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever mayne
Im shutting shit down in the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I aint even planning to call
I want this shit forever mayne
Last name ever first name greatest
Like a sprained ankle boy I aint nothing to play with
Started off local but thanks to all the haters
I know gfour pilots on a first name basis
In your city faded off the brown nino
She insists she got more class we know
Swimming in the money come and find me Nemo
If I was at the club you know I bald Kimo
Dropped a mixtape that shit sounded like an album
Whod a thought a country-wide tour would be the outcome
Labels want my name beside an X like Malcolm
Everybody got a deal I did it without one
Yeah nigga Im about my business
Killing all these rappers you would swear I had a hit list
Everyone who doubted me is asking for forgiveness
If you aint been a part of it at least you got to witness bitches
It may not mean nothing to yall
But understand nothing was done for me
So I dont plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever mayne
Im shutting shit down in the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I aint even planning to call
I want this shit forever mayne
I used to have hood dreams big fame big chains
I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came
I went hard all fall like the ball teams
Just so I could make it rain all spring
Yall seen my story my glory
I had raped the game young you could call it statutory
When a nigga blow up they gon build statues for me
Old money Benjamin Button what I nutting
Now superbad chicks giving me McLovin
You would think I ran the world like Michelles husband
You would think these niggas would know me when they really doesnt
Like they was down with the old me no you fucking wasnt
Youre such a fucking loser
He didnt even go to class Bueller
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back
Remember she had that bad hip like a fanny pack
Chasing that stardom would turn you into a maniac
All the way in Hollywood and I cant even act
They pull their cameras out and goddamn they snap
I used to want this thing forever you can have it back
It may not mean nothing to yall
But understand nothing was done for me
So I dont plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever mayne
Im shutting shit down in the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I aint even planning to call
I want this shit forever mayne
Okay hello its da Martian space jam Jordans
I want this shit forever wake up and smell the garden
Fresher than the harvest step up to the target
If I had one guess then I guess Im just New Orleans
And I will never stop like Im running from the cops
Hop up in my car and told my chauffeur to the top
Life is like a fucking roller coaster then it drops
But what should I scream for this is my theme park
My minds shine even when my thoughts seem dark
Pistol on my side you dont wanna hear that thing talk
Let the king talk check the price and pay attention
Lil Wayne thats what they got to say or mention
Im like Nevada in the middle of the summer
Im resting in the lead I need a pillow and a cover
Shh my foots sleeping on the gas
No brake pads no such thing as last
It may not mean nothing to yall
But understand nothing was done for me
So I dont plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever mayne
Im shutting shit down in the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I aint even planning to call
I want this shit forever mayne
There they go back in stadiums as shady spits his flow
Nuts they go macadamia they go so ballistic whoa
We can make them look like Bosos
Hes wondering if he should spit this slow
Fuck no go for broke
His cup just runneth over oh no
He aint had a buzz like this since the last time he overdosed
Theyve been waiting patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose
Back into the game and they know
Rap will never be the same as before
Bashing in the brains of these hoes
And establishing a name as he goes
The passion and the flame is ignited
You cant put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck Im talking about
When we riot
You dealing with a few true villains
Whose staying inside of the booth truth spilling
And spit true feelings till our tooth fillings
Come flying up out of our mouths now rewind it
Payback muthafucka for the way you got at
Me so hows it taste
When I slap the taste out your mouth with the bass
So loud that it shakes the place
Im Hannibal Lecter so just in case
Youre thinking of saving face
You aint gonna have no face to save
By the time Im through with this place
So play some DrakeGood God Almighty like back in the old days
You know years ago they had the AR men to tell you what to play
How to play it and you know whether its disco and rock
But um we just went in the studio and we did it
We had champagne in the studio of course you know
Compliments of the company and we just laid back and did it
So we hope you enjoy listening to this album half as much

Got some time off Girl its been so long
Did you have fun
Cause Imma need a cab just to get me home
Maybe you could call in sick
Bring it to the crib and get all this all this
I know Im blunt but how real is that
You want that feeling back
Probably one of my realest loves ever four page letters
In time its all better cause time heal whatever
Imma need a moment cause moments last forever
Cars with cream leather females are on regular
Whats the point in titles we liking it how they tell us
Id rather stay friends with benefits til we ready
Now ready Sean Don got me feeling heavy
She like one more chance more problems no Biggie ah
Its all good dont take it the wrong way
Aint nothing personal but who this nigga in your face
We can leave together or you can take your space
The night young we should head over to my place
Ha now we laughing and all that
Tell your friend they can fall back
Aint even gotta ask twice
She said what you feeling like

I feel good
Got some time off girl its been so long
Did you have fun
Cause Imma need a cab just to get me home
Maybe you could call in sick
Bring it to the crib and get all this
I know Im blunt but how real is that
You want that feeling back
Well you should know

And even though we let it go its better that you know
I still got it for ya I still got it for ya 
And even though we let it go its better that you know

Aint nobody like you
Heard you got a ballplayer
But he dont excite you
I aint the one you gotta lie to
Lay down relax climax let me bite you
Still a superfreak
You know how I be when Im rolling in the streets
Enough about me I heard you finished your degree
Just call me Ginuwine cause Im the same Ol G
We was young full of insecurities
Grown up now all we got is old memories
Used to be like enemies arguing in Barneys fly shit
Too much pride to say sorry
Shit problems running like half the day
Number twenty-four let it fade away
She gotta leave but she wanna stay
She like how you feeling babe
Like shitGucci Mane
Im so f-cking dumb I wear diamonds on my thumbs
Theres a diamond on my d-ck so theres a diamond on her tongue
I cant feel you baby cos I romantically numb
Emotionally drained I came here just so I can come
Theres nothing on the God son that I havent done
I got a lot of problems getting p-ssy just isnt one
Girls are like buses every fifteen mins they run
Man they like potato chips I just cant have one
And I might like you for a minute
But I dont like your friends in my business
And I feel like you dont deserve a visit
Cos you aint in the kitchen when you want a whipping
Drake - Chorus
Uh uh ahhhh
I know you say you love me girrrrrrrrl
I know you say you love me girrrrrrrrl
Problem is you prol tell that sh-t to everybody
So we hear you talking boo but we just dont believe you
Uh ok Im all about it all for it
Im all star team Jordan small forward
Im never putting up a shot unless it calls for it
No hesitation so Im shooting if I draw for it
How how f-ck is up now man Im in this hoe
Life is moving fast where the f-ck do all these minutes go
Mixtape dropped then I started getting ten a show
Now I get a hundred what the f-ck you think Im in it for
Young money forever I bet Gudda Jay and Mack agree
F-ck you to the haters that just spend their time attacking me
Shout out to your girlfriend n-gga lately she distracting me
Wondering if Im the best Well-I-am no Black Eyed Peas
Girls wanna f-ck your n-ggas guy dont wanna be you
Lining up around the block so that they can get to see you
I feel like I find a wife exactly when I need to
So you can say whatever girl but we just dont believe you
Chorus
Sean Garrett

And uh my real friends never hearin from me
Fake friends write the wrong answers on the mirror for me
Thats why I pick and choose I dont get shit confused
I got a small circle Im not with different crews
We walk the same path but got on different shoes
Live in the same building but we got different views
I got a couple cars I never get to use
Dont like my women single I like my chicks in twos
And these days all the girls is down to roll
I hit the strip club and all them bitches find a pole

Guns turn you boys into pussies sex change

Back when they thought pink polos would hurt the Roc
Before Cam got the shit to pop the doors was closed
I felt like Bad Boys street team I couldnt work the Lox locks
Now lets go
Take em back to the plan
Me and my momma hopped in the U-Haul van
Any pessimists I aint talked to them
Plus I aint have no phone in my apartment
Lets take em back to the club
Least about an hour I would stand on line
I just wanted to dance
I went to Jacob an hour after I got my advance
I just wanted to shine
Jays favorite line Dog in due time
Now he look at me like Damn dog you where I am
A hip hop legend
I think I died in an accident cause this must be heaven

They say your attitude determines your latitude
Im high as a motherfucker - fly as a motherfucker
And still the motherfucker you love to hate
But cant - because you love what I make
Drake
But its another story over here at Drakes house
Cause Im dripped up and Im drapped out
And Im lean back
Scoping
Looking for a woman that I should wife
Who got just the right amount of loyalty
Yeah but is still anticipating us living the good life
We go LA VA
NY TO
Sunshine in that heat stroke
And them fur hoods in that deep snow
We have breakfast in the bedroom
Break bread downstairs in the basement
I took my lifestyle from mediocre to good and now I say its sittin at amazing
Girls tryin sell a whole lobby of us
Hear em all screamin then its probably is
But I cant blame females females cant really ignore something this obvious
What you really expect when I strut through town
Two or three days I shut you down

Lupe Fiasco
guess whos on third
Lupe still like Lupin the Third
Hear life here till Im beer on the curb
Peach fuzz buzz but beard on the verge
Slow it down like were on the syrup
Bottle-shaped body like Mrs Butterwerf
But before you say another word
Im back on the block like Im layin on the street
Im trying to stop lying like a Mum-Ra
But Im not lying when Im laying on the beat
Engarde Touch Lupe cool as the Unthawed
But I still feel as possessed as a gun charge
I come as correct as a porn star
In a fresh pair of steps and my best foreign car
In a fresh pair of steps and my best foreign car

Drake - Verse
uh red lipstick on the wine glass cameras in my mind
flash black lines aray white diamonds what a contrast
i know you get impatient as the time pass you say you want it fast
define fast cause i can speed it up and make it last
and i could audition for this and i could be part of the cast
and i could produce for your future i could co-direct your past
and make damn sure you never forget it commited im ready im with it
still here like a statue pink champagne green ink in your tattoos
you say you got bagges well im packed too plus i got a sex pistol
pointed right at you BAM the baddest women ever in the heart of south
proven over and over again thats why im hard to doubt plus im
young money till the death i took the carter route
im more than ready too hope of something that you thought about
Chorus
EndYou could thank me now
Uh go head
Thank me later yeah I know what I said
But later doesnt always come so instead
Its o-okay
You could thank me now
Uh yeah well alright here I go
Mahalo from the hardest act to follow
Lately Ive been drinking like theres a message in a bottle
Alohas to women with no ties
To men that I know well
That way there are no lies
You could thank me now for all the info I give to you niggas
Im on the brink of influential
Im here for you niggas
I guess a hit doesnt add up to a career for you niggas
I must have been hard to watch
What a year for you niggas
Its December thirty-onest and we in Miami just meditating
You got the resolutions we just got reservations
Living out a dream it feels like I stayed up
And we just wanna party patron straight up
Fuck that old shit Im on new things
O-V-O clique Red wing boot gang
Yeah we want it all half was never the agreement
Whod thought the route we chose would ever end up this scenic
I could relate to kids going straight to the league
When they recognize that you got what it takes to succeed
And thats around the time that your idols become your rivals
You make friends with Mike but gotta AI him for your survival
Damn I swear sports and music are so synonymous
cause we wanna be them and they wanna be us
Yeah so on behalf of the demanded
And the entertainment that you take for granted
You could thank me now
And oh my goodness youre welcome
Youre welcome
At this point me is who Im trying to save myself from
Rappers hit me up and I never know what to tell them
Cause they think that I can help them get back to where they fell from
But drink up because everyone here is good tonight
Except the niggas that I came with they good for life
Yeah thats how you know its going down
In case another chance never comes around
You could thank me now
Uh go head
Thank me later yeah I know what I said
But later doesnt always come so instead
Its o-okay
You could thank me now
Uh shallow nigga but deep enough to have gone swimming
I think Im spending all my time with the wrong women
I think I have a chance at love but knowing me I miss it
Cause me dedicating my time just isnt realistic
Man the good girls went silent on me
They got a boyfriend or left for college on me
And all the bad ones I used to hit her friends now
That make me wish I had a little less mileage on me
But do I ever come up in discussion over double pump lattes
And low fat muffins do I
Or is missing what we had outta the question
Im probably just the reason that you learned your lesson
I got flows for the Marilyn Monroes whos there before it all
I guess thats how it goes
They hear about your cons or focus on your pros
And love you for who you are from the bottom of their soul
But those same ones from your area will grow
Into women that are ready to get married at hello
Because of what they allow
Where are they all now
I know there somewhere watching so Im trying to make them proud
Searching for the meaning
Youll find it next to me
And tell me Im the hottest guess we finally get to see
Im feeling like Nas who am I to disagree
They say that doors open up as soon as you find the missing key
Its probably why Im in this bitch shining
Jump up in the sky and put the stars into alignment
I rep the A-T-F in case you need to be reminded
And the bandwagons full but you can try and run behind it
Im sorry poolside drinking
Margarita rounds
Shout out to my city though I hardly be in town
Im the Black Sheep but Chris Farley wears the crown
And I know life is just a game in which the cards are facing down
Im in the world where things are taken never given
How long they choose to love you will never be your decision
And Im aware that this could be the last time you listen
So while Im still here in this positionChorus
I gotta be honest I think you know
Were covered in lies and thats okay
Theres somewhere beyond this I know
But I hope I can find the words to say 
Yeah normally it aint a question
We would cross paths like an intersection
But she just too far away for affection
So I pray that we never lose the connection
Cause I remember Stacy she probably hate me
She used to threaten she had a man to replace me
She talked that shit I just hit the escape key
And then shed get mad and want to go and erase me
And I remember Amy she used to AIM me
She stayed up late and used to blame me
She say Im too wild she wanna tame me
I told her Even Photoshop couldnt change me
But you-you-you You got me open girl why lie
We aint even tryin to settle so why try
End the night with a kiss and a bye-bye
No strings attached your love is so WiFi
Chorus
I gotta be honest I think you know
Were covered in lies and thats okay
Theres somewhere beyond this I know
But I hope I can find the words to say
My freak girl tell me now she a christian
My white girl wanna move back to Michigan
Im pullin girls off the bench like a sixth-man
Im in the club doin the same ol two step
While Omegas doin the same ol que step
I had my money on my mind I was thinkin green
She a pledge AKA she was pink and green
I wanna good girl she want a gentleman
We sayin the same thing like a synonym
I wasnt really spittin game I was scrimmigin
My pimpinship so hard it needs censorship
Ima chicagoan till Chicago ends
Till we blow like Chicago wind
I dont know whats better gettin laid or gettin paid
I just know Ima gettin one the others gettin awayIve been up for four days
Getting money both ways
Dirty and clean I could use a glass of cold spades
Rolexes chauffeurs and low fades
I keep thinking how young you can die from old age
They always tell me nobodys working as hard as you
And even though I laugh it off man its probably true
Cause while all of my closest friends out partying
Im just here making all the music that they party to
But party on party on all night nigga
I got these new rappers nervous prom night nigga
Ive grown tired of these fucking grown man liars
Storytellers they aint even need a campfire
Uh but I just wanna tell the truth
Before one of these haters load a couple shells and shoot
This shit feel like when Fredro Starr was at Sunset Park
Stuntin hard in his yellow Goose
Yeah but Im a mafuckin missed target
But a target nonetheless and I just started
Was that directed at moi Cant be
They must be talking to themselves hoe hands free
Yeah and Im just filling up this daily planner
Gettin busy cause Im a star no spangled banner
Jealous dudes get to talkin in they music
And I just say I wrote it for your girlfriends Kelsey Grammar
Yeah thats what life becomes when youre doing you
Welcome to Hollywood dont let this town ruin you
And if you pillow talking with the women that are screwin you
Just know that she gon tell another nigga when she through wit you
Dont get impatient when it takes too long
Drink it all even when it tastes too strong
Yeah I gotta feel alive even if it kills me
Promise to always give you me the real me
Who would have thought
Id be caught in this life
Lets celebrate with a toast
And get lost in tonight
And make it all light up
Hey Guru tell home girl to go to open that Ace right there
Wait until the sun goes down
We gon make this bitch light up
Even when the sun goes down
Im gon make this go
Ow hoes turn they heads like owls
Im the man of the hour
Triple entendre dont even ask me how
Con Edison flow Im connected to a higher power
Bright lifed make your whole city light up
A trillion-watt light bulb when Im in the nightclub
I just landed in that Gfour hundred and fifty
Caught the Mayweather fight cause the satellite was crispy
Uh Yall can miss me with that money talk
The smart moneys on Hov fuck what the dummies talk
I dont do too much blogging
I just run the town I dont do too much joggin
Uh I aint got a scar yet
Cause you fuckin around with me and my dogs is far-fetched
Drake here is how they gon come at you
Will silly raps feuds tryin to distract you
In disguise in the form of a favor
The Barzini me watch for the traitors
Uh I done seen it all done it all
Thats why none of these dumb-dumb could dun him off
The summers ours the winter too
Top down in the winter thats what winners do
And to these niggas Im like Windows seven
You let em tell it they swear that they invented you
And since no good deed go unpunished
Im not as cool with niggas as I once was
I once was cool as The Fonz was
But these bright lights turned me to a monster
Sorry mama I promised it wouldnt change me
But I wouldve went insane had I remained the same me
Fuck niggas bitches too
All I got is this money thisll do
Who would have thought
Id be caught in this life
Lets celebrate with a toast
And get lost in tonight
And make it all light up
Wait until the sun goes down
We gon make this bitch light up
Wait until the sun goes down

You gettin ready so I know we gon be here awhile
In the bathroom flat irons and nail files
Spending hours in salons on your hairstyles
In the mall steady rackin up the air miles
Hit the gym step on the scales stare at the number
You say you dropping ten pounds preparing for summer
And you dont do it for the man men never notice
You just do it for yourself youre the fucking coldest
Intelligent too ooh youre my sweetheart
Ive always liked my women book and street smart
Long as they got a little class like half days
And the confidence to overlook my past ways
Time heals all and heels hurt to walk in
But they go with the clutch that you carry your lip gloss in
And look I really think that nobody does it better
I love the way you put it together ugh

Unless you play these suckers just like BoB play the guitar

Closet full of brand new clothes and hand bags

Mature women with more than me were the first to tempt me
And Jason had this girl Tammy with a purple Bentley
How she got it I aint never get to ask

Yeah but shout out to the homeowners
The girls that got diplomas
And enough money to loan us a little something extra
Should we ever need it
If it sounds like you then let me hear you repeat it

Now its Bentley four doors with Madrona on the door
Thats light wood nigga Polo fuck Hilfiger
Jammin Slim Thug belly fulla of drugs
Young hard nigga underdog nigga

Chorus
Well its the trill OG

Belts on the back of it my homie shoes runnin shit
And shorty on the side of me is straight up off the King cover
Dont care what anybody say long as the king love her
Wish I could tell her that I dont but it would kill her

Blowin thousand dollar killa
With that Filipino flow that I just got it from Manila
Bout to snow up in my city
So let me put on my chinchilla
In the Rari doin donuts like my name was J Dilla
All about the skrilla so just point me to the dealer
Keep the work up in the attic and the money in the cella

Other girls they got attention
But I just always feel like there in need of something you got
Its obvious you are pretty
Heard that your a student working weekends in the city
Trying to take you out girl hope your not too busy
And if theres nothing wrong got this little song
For you to get ready to
Put those fucking heels on and work it girl
Let that mirror show you what your doing
Put that fucking dress on and work it kind of vicious
Like somebodys taking pictures
Shut it down down down
You would shut it down down down
You be the baddest girl around round round
And they notice they notice

Til you finally come around round round

Ice cream conversations they all want the scoop
You shut that shut that down down down
Shooting stars all around her fire comets

No youre not imagining theyre looking at you long stares
Even though shes standing out she looks like she belongs here
You feel the hours pass until you find somethin
I feel like when she moves the time doesnt
Yeah baby you finer than your fine cousin
And your cousin fine but she dont have my heart beating in double time
You just shut it down girl
Who told the cops where the party was
Why do I feel like I found The One
Whats in these shots that you ordered us
Damn I mean you sure know how to paint a town
Ever since you came around its obvious you shut it down
You shut that shit down down down down

They notice they notice
Let me lay you down down down
Tryna lay you down down down
You still the baddest girl around round round
And they notice they notice
You would shut itUh I am a distraction
Comin from my spot and I dont signal as I back in
If cash is beautiful and money is attraction
Then I should be a motherfuckin centerfold to Maxim
Open to my page and admire my desire
Frequent flyer I aspire to retire
My voice stands alone even if Im with the choir
Got a cannon on my hip but nigga this is not Mariah
Nah this the record killer for hire
I sleep and eat with the weapon the beat is all I require
Look what I created despite the niggas that hated
Every single bar gettin first forty-eighted
In the state of euphoria feelin so sedated
The me and bitch the same we feeling so related
Forest Hill estated or Dennis Caded
I put a thousand on it I could prolly fuck the waitress
So wait just take this
One line at a time make sure it makes sense
White cup orange pop Tennessee State shit
Drop a four in it and appreciate the greatness nigga haha
Yeah I wrote this verse sittin in my new car
Sometimes where you headed is too far
Its more about where you are
And I am everywhere that you wish you could be
Somebody somewhere just really understood me
Yeah I dream big no false hope
My other niggas move keys no off notes
But understand rich is how were all ending up
Im at the label in the elevator
Send them upAll my niggas so hungry man they just eat what they kill
I like convertible Bentleys and houses deep in the Hills
I might tell the whole crew come through
My squad gotta roll through come through
Tell the young high school kids keep dreamin
Because they sure do come true
Then I say this that fuckin mob shit this that fuckin player shit
This that shake a bottle up and bust the top and spray the shit
Bitches gettin dugout like where all the fuckin players sit
And like you just got traded girl
You dont know who youre playin with
Oh yeah oh yeah my sound is what up right now
Ive been down but Im up right now
Nigga been backstrokin and breaststrokin
Through that lane that you left open
Man I dont give a fuck right now
Let a nigga swim in the pussy on the low
Bout to go drown in the cup right now holla
I dont know what it was about you
Like blue you left me without a clue
I pictured the fate is it true
Cause I try to make this shit work
But it seems like is it your feelings
You kept them hatin bitches all in our business
But I just got one question baby tell me why
I Started from the bottom like Drake said high
You the type of nigga gettin robbed on a blind date my squadll
Kick in your door where that safe at
No Atari games girl I dont play that
If she broke on that nutshell
Everything I say I follow What you talkin bout
Ummm Polo shirt my collar up
Drippin on these hoes
Aint by myself its a lot of us
Made a little money still aint got enough
And if you got a nigga dead put your lighter up
Keep my eyes open dont say nothin
Motor geeked up like a raisin
You dont know me you must mistake me
For somebody else
But its somethin about you that I fell in love with
Your ex nigga fuck him
I had to tell her that
I dont know what it was about you
Like blue you left me without a clue
I pictured the fate is it true
Cause I try to make this shit work
But it seems like is it your feelings
You kept them hatin bitches all in our business
But I just got one question baby tell me whyJhene
woahhhhhh woahhhh ohhhhhhh
ahhhhhh mhmmmmmmm ahhh ohhh
woah woah woahh ahhhh
Drake
Yea thats it uh
This verse starts as my snipers hit their marks
And your guards fall down from a rifle to the heart
Like clap clap let them fall slow
I know you had your fears you could let them all go
And most women are motivated so I act accordingly
But this is so refreshing that it means a little more to me
Dedicating time when I really cant afford to be
I provide protection if you open up the door for me
Couple stares couple texts couple dates
Couple i think that were readys couple I think we should waits
Are we actin like a couple Im just tryna get it straight
Cause Im over here convinced that its too early for mistakes
Chorus
You had to change up the game
Oh the weather is not same
Now theres only cloudy days
I cant stand the rain in July
There were fireworks exploding
But now its getting colder
The leaves are turning colors
Whyyyyyy
Its just not our season
The one and only reason
Baby oh baby oh our Summer turned into Fall
Drake
Damn tell where did all the magic go
I followed the rules and told you everything you had to know
Had you over every night
Every night was passionate
Plus you met my mother even if it was an accident
Im confused tell me where we go wrong
I was sure I would be with you for so long
I was planning on this being something worth mentioning
Energy invested in someone I saw potential in
Who killed chivalry they need to get their sentencing
Meanwhile were arguing and I cant get a sentence in
And just as I predict that here we go again
They always say the hottest love has the coldest end
Chorus
Jhene
See its funny cause I never thought this would end
But then the season changed
Drake
You were my you were my you were my girl
Jhene
I was your girl
Drake
Shoulda made shoulda made you my world
Shoulda did everything to make you happy baby
Jhene
Cant wait for fourx springtime
And I will turn into a butterfly
I will spread my wings and fly
Fly
And Im too fly for this shit
Flytwox
Oooohohhhhoohh
I am Japanese if you pleaseLets go Well alright Well alright yo
Look uhn feelin sorry for the runner-up
Im still awake gettin money when the sun is up
And they keep sayin how they need me to deliver
Cuz they hate it when them rookie starters can put the numbers up
Man haters so passe catch me in a tie or a suit on Draft day nigga
And its just me and my money
You dont even get to play when yall are leadin by twenty
Yeah I infiltrated the game
I was hesitant at first then feared what it would change
Now Im high off the success and faded off of the fame
And still I managed to keep all of my opinions the same
Man I am so far gone bitch Im outta here
Hotter than standin inside rockin outter-ware
I want it all man I never learned how to share
I also can no longer converse wit you thousand-aires
Wow I swear Im killin shit Im killin shit
Shoutout to the niggas I just made a couple million wit Yeah
From the beginning to the end no Im into makin history not into makin friends muthafucka IHow did I end up right here with you

Feels like when you gettin to that paper hip hop hates ya
They would do it just like I do if they could

Ah young and rich and out of control
Out in LA blowing clouds of that killer

Btches takin pictres because every nights a photo op

I say Imma buy the bar and they say ngga no youre not
I be satisfied with the percentage that my lawyer got
Makin other people rich is something I enjoy alot
Uh can you tell even when your girl wont
Imma still be feelin me even when the world dont
Sht just changed forever first I get alot of dough
Then I end up with your woman thats just how its gotta go

You can get whatever baby remember you and me tonight
Throw the pssy at me guarentee that you wont see a strike
Imma hit it hard you gon think you Derek Jeter wife
Uh tell me how does that sound
I can get it ass up and with your back down
Spit that all suki suki in your ear
Its the ngga Rich Boy and the rookie of the yearMoney just changed everything I wonder how life without it would go
From the concrete who knew that a flower would grow
Lookin down from the top and its crowded below
My fifteen minutes started an hour ago
Truth over fame you know I respect the blatant sht
When I hear talkin I just dont know what to make of it
Hate is so familiar to me Im slowly embracing it
Doesnt come natural bear with me it could take a bit
Yeah and my dreams who Im racing with
You can see Im pacin it so that Im always chasin it
Wayne put me right here thats who I get the paper with
I hope that my success never alters our relationship
Yeah this life is something I would die for
Octobers Own but its lookin like July fourth
I just wish theyd let you try it first
This time Im really goin off fireworks
Today it begins
I missed them before but wont miss them again
I keep having the same dream
And I think I just realized what it means
All I see is fireworks all I see is fireworks
Every night its fireworks every night its fireworks
All I see is fireworks all I see is fireworks
Taking off like fireworks takin off like oh-ah-oh-oh
Im just such a gentleman you should give it up for me
Look at how Im placing all my napkins and my cutlery
I can tell it wasnt love I just thought you fuck with me
Who coulda predicted love could strike now you stuck with me
Damn I kept my wits about me luckily
What happened between us that night it always seems to trouble me
Now all of a sudden these gossip brags wanna cover me
And you making it seem that it happened that way because of me
But I was curious and Ill never forget it baby
What an experience you coulda been the one but it wasnt that serious
Their was smoke in the air before now its me clearing it
That felt good all and all I learned a lesson from it though
You never see it coming you just get to see it go
Yeah I shoulda looked up in the sky at first
Now I can see it in her eyes fireworks
Today it begins
I missed them before but wont miss them again
I keep having the same dream
And I think I just realized what it means
All I see is fireworks all I see is fireworks
Every night its fireworks every night its fireworks
All I see is fireworks all I see is fireworks
Taking off like fireworks takin off like oh-ah-oh-oh
Everything the same but it feels different
My dad called me up knowing that I still listen
And hes still got his foot out guilt trippin
Its been years though I just learn to deal with it
For real me and my realtor we built up a better rapport
Got my mother in a place with some better decor
She searched the entire city I let her explore
Ant now shes sayin shes more lonely than every before
How many of our parents marriages lasted
I was only five I bet I barely reacted
Im flying back home for the heritage classic
Searchin for that feeling tell me where is the magic
Lets stay together til were ghosts
I want to witness love Ive never seen it close
Yeah but I guess I gotta find it first
Thats why Im really going off Fireworks
Today it begins
I missed them before but wont miss them again
I keep having the same dream
And I think I just realized what it means
All I see is fireworks all I see is fireworks
Every night its fireworks every night its fireworks
All I see is fireworks all I see is fireworks
Taking off like fireworks takin off like oh-ah-oh-ohYou could thank me now
Uh go head
Thank me later yeah I know what I said
But later doesnt always come so instead
Its o-okay
You could thank me now
Uh yeah well alright here I go
Mahalo from the hardest act to follow
Lately Ive been drinking like theres a message in a bottle
Alohas to women with no ties
To men that I know well
That way there are no lies
You could thank me now for all the info I give to you niggas
Im on the brink of influential
Im here for you niggas
I guess a hit doesnt add up to a career for you niggas
I must have been hard to watch
What a year for you niggas
Its December thirty-onest and we in Miami just meditating
You got the resolutions we just got reservations
Living out a dream it feels like I stayed up
And we just wanna party patron straight up
Fuck that old shit Im on new things
O-V-O clique Red wing boot gang
Yeah we want it all half was never the agreement
Whod thought the route we chose would ever end up this scenic
I could relate to kids going straight to the league
When they recognize that you got what it takes to succeed
And thats around the time that your idols become your rivals
You make friends with Mike but gotta AI him for your survival
Damn I swear sports and music are so synonymous
cause we wanna be them and they wanna be us
Yeah so on behalf of the demanded
And the entertainment that you take for granted
You could thank me now
And oh my goodness youre welcome
Youre welcome
At this point me is who Im trying to save myself from
Rappers hit me up and I never know what to tell them
Cause they think that I can help them get back to where they fell from
But drink up because everyone here is good tonight
Except the niggas that I came with they good for life
Yeah thats how you know its going down
In case another chance never comes around
You could thank me now
Uh go head
Thank me later yeah I know what I said
But later doesnt always come so instead
Its o-okay
You could thank me now
Uh shallow nigga but deep enough to have gone swimming
I think Im spending all my time with the wrong women
I think I have a chance at love but knowing me I miss it
Cause me dedicating my time just isnt realistic
Man the good girls went silent on me
They got a boyfriend or left for college on me
And all the bad ones I used to hit her friends now
That make me wish I had a little less mileage on me
But do I ever come up in discussion over double pump lattes
And low fat muffins do I
Or is missing what we had outta the question
Im probably just the reason that you learned your lesson
I got flows for the Marilyn Monroes whos there before it all
I guess thats how it goes
They hear about your cons or focus on your pros
And love you for who you are from the bottom of their soul
But those same ones from your area will grow
Into women that are ready to get married at hello
Because of what they allow
Where are they all now
I know there somewhere watching so Im trying to make them proud
Searching for the meaning
Youll find it next to me
And tell me Im the hottest guess we finally get to see
Im feeling like Nas who am I to disagree
They say that doors open up as soon as you find the missing key
Its probably why Im in this bitch shining
Jump up in the sky and put the stars into alignment
I rep the A-T-F in case you need to be reminded
And the bandwagons full but you can try and run behind it
Im sorry poolside drinking
Margarita rounds
Shout out to my city though I hardly be in town
Im the Black Sheep but Chris Farley wears the crown
And I know life is just a game in which the cards are facing down
Im in the world where things are taken never given
How long they choose to love you will never be your decision
And Im aware that this could be the last time you listen
So while Im still here in this positionLet me know let me know
Ooh let me know let me know let me know
Uh yeah this is really one of my dumbest flows ever
I havent slept in days
And me and my latest girl agreed to go our separate ways
So Im single thinking about what we had and missing you
But I aint Santa I got something for these bad bitches too
I mean paparazzi on me trying not to get caught out
They always seem to catch me with the woman that I brought out
Baby dont hold on too long cause thats how them stories start out
And all the girls that played me eat your motherfucking heart out its Drizzy
Always gone but never hard to find
And since you cant escape me do I ever cross your mind
Because all this shit is new to me Im learning to behave
And still spending every dollar they encourage me to save
But Im good I know that niggas would kill for this lifestyle
Im looking forward to the memories of right now
Never forgetting from where I came
And no matter where Im headed
I promise to stay the same yeah look
Im just riding round the city with my hood on and my windows down
Ask your girl Im the realest nigga she been around
I pull up in something new and park it by the haters
And when you get to talking bout the greatest
I just really hope that Youll think of me
I just really hope that Youll think of me
I just really hope that Youll think of me
Im doin my thing Cause Im tryna be unforgettable
This just might be my realest flow ever
When I say fo life yall say foever foever
Its hard but its fair I told that girl life hurts
The closest your gone get to this is a Pac T-shirt
The names young baby you know I live that thug life
The good die young so Im gone need a thug wife
Yeah Im talking his and her firearms
Know our jewelry probably louder than a car alarm yeah
Yeah I remember I used to have to sneak the car
Now my insides looking like a snickers bar
Yeah Im talking caramel leathers
Damn right so fly I need feathers
Sayin shit in the streets so whats the dilly
You done everything in the A but fuck Chilli haha
So welcome to my life no two days the same
Like for yall to meet the love of my life her names the game
Im just riding round the city with my hood on and my windows down
Ask your girl Im the realest nigga she been around
I pull up in something new and park it by the haters
And when you get to talking bout the greatest
I just really hope that Youll think of me
I just really hope that Youll think of me
I just really hope that Youll think of me
Im doin my thing Cause Im tryna be unforgettable
Got my top dropped on this beautiful night
This beautiful night to live my beautiful life
Pain hurts like a cut from a beautiful knife
Just know she right here on my hip my beautiful wife

And I thought I found the girl of my dreams at the strip club
Fuck it I was wrong though
Shout out to all my niggas living tax free
Nowadays its six figures when they tax me
Oh well guess you lose some and win some
Long as the outcome is income
You know I want it all and then some
Shout out to all my asian girls Dim sum
Shots came I dont know where they descend from
Probably some bad hoes Im bout to take ya hem from
Yeah you know me well nigga
I mean you aint the only the real nigga
They got me on these white women like seal nigga
Slave to the pussy but Im just playing the field nigga
Yeah are these people really discussing my career again
Asking about me going platinum in a year again
Dont I got that shit the world wanna hear again
Dont Michael Jordan still got his hoop earring in
Man all of your flows just bore me paint drying
I dont never be trippin off of what aint mine
I be hearing the shit that you say through the grape vine
But jealousy is just love and hate at the same timeThings have been so crazy and hectic I should have got her back by now
But you know how much I wanted to make it Its probably better anyhow
So if you gotta go if theres anything I should know
If the spotlight makes you nervous
If youre looking for a purpose
You put the tea in the kettle and light it
Put your hand on the metal and feel it
But do you even feel it anymore
I remember when you thought I was joking
Now Im off singing karaoke
Farther than Ive ever been
So if you gotta go if theres any way I can help
Isnt it ironic that the girl I wanna marry is a wedding planner
And tells me that my life is too much and moves to Atlanta Damn
Of all the places you could go
I just thought youd choose somewhere that has somebody that you know
Im always up too late I worry about you there alone
And that place you call your home warm nights and cold Patron
I hope you dont get known for nothing crazy
Cause no man ever wants to hear those stories about his lady
I know they say the first love is the sweetest
But that first cut is the deepest
I tried to keep us together you were busy keeping secrets
You were telling everybody but me
Dont be fooled by the money Im still just young and unlucky
Im surprised you couldnt tell
I was only trying to get ahead
I was only trying to get ahead
But the spotlight makes you nervous
And youre looking for a purpose
I was only trying to get ahead
I was only trying to get ahead
But the spotlight makes you nervousIm more than just an option
hey hey hey
Refuse to be forgotten
hey hey hey
I took a chance with my heart
hey hey hey
And I feel it taking over
I better find your lovin

See I just want what I cant have oh
Want her to give me a chance oh
Claiming Im just not as serious as you
Shawty if you only knew

Want her to give me a chance oh
Claiming Im just not as serious as you
Shawty if you only knew

So I always know watsup
A picture wont do me justice
League in this bitch Im a do me trust this
Patience little label nigga you wont rush this
I got the hand on my money sweetie you cant touch this
I got a revolutionary flow in every scenario
Coming through your stereo
Bust my girlfriend booty round like the merry-go
Bitches like where he at they be like there he go
And this verse deserve a burial
Dont cry for me this aint mafuckin mario
Yea and polo isnt at my session

Down down
Yo my ex-girl say she done dating black guys
She shoulda listened when her white friends advised

There aint too many niggas Id rather be than me
I guarantee those women gettin at him would agree
That he should go ahead put a patent on his G and

I could own half as much clothing and be twice as fly
Yea you know my coupe sits super low
Tops slip off like Janet at the Superbowl
OK OK Im grown grown
Party at my house but Im home alone
Doing every single thing my momma wouldnt condone
Counting everything I own in my ma fucking zone

These are my one St Thomas flows
Me and my niggas and some Madonna hoes
That look just like virgins
But trust they down to go
Discussin life and all our common goals
Smart kids that smoke weed honor roll
Look how the champagne diamonds flow
Fine dining pour another another glass when the wine is low
Im in the crib stackin money from here to the ceilin
Whatever it is I got is clearly appealin
These other rappers gettin that inferior feelin
I hope you feel it in your soul spiritual healin
Take a look at yourself the mirrors revealin
If you aint got it you aint got it the theory is brilliant
People ask how music is goin I heard it pays
I just came off makin two million in thirty days
Damn I guess it does what the message was
Sometimes I feel I be spendin my money just because
But Weezy Im just out here reppin us
Til I get to shake the hand of the man thats blessin us
Yeah I know these niggas miss the mean lyrics
Kush got the room smellin like teen spirit
I asked kindly if no-one out here would bring defeat up
Until I lose for now Im the games single leader
I fly private so no-one tells me to bring my seat up
And book a suite when me and your favorite singer meet up
Who you like tell me who it is
Imma make sure that that women is the next one on my list
I should call it a night but fuck it I cant resist
This one is for all my niggas from my city tryin to diss
Without a response from me you really fail to exist
And I love to see you fail that feelin there is the shit
I swear aghh pussy nigga get your bread up
Enjoy the seat that the stewardess just forced your ass to let up
Why your scary ass lookin down pick your head up
No-one told you your disguise is the most ridiculous gettup
With nose plugs in now I can smell a set up
So your just wastin your time your just only makin me better
Yeah I try to tell them dont judge me because you heard stuff
Chase N Cash thats my brother from the Surf Club
Damn that nigga always kept it so hood
Back when we would smoke good at the Oakwoods
And have girls fall through like coins in a couch
Now we just fuckin all the bitches they warned us about
Scared for the first time everything has clicked
What if I dont really do the numbers they predict
Considerin the fact that Im the one that they just picked
To write a chapter in history this shit has got me sick
But if I really do it dont expect to get a split
Cause this truly is some shit I dont expect yall to get
Im nervous but Imma kill it cause they bout to let the realest team in
Throwin up in a huddle nigga Willie Beamen
Were still throwin touchdown passes
In tortoise frame glasses hopin that someone catch it
People say that old Drake we startin to miss it
But they need to be a little more specific
Man is this what yall want In my best Chris Tucker impression
Ducking your questions fuck your suggestions
Money gets all of my love and affection
Cars all black like the cover of Essence
Im allergic to coming in second but I never sneeze
YMOE nigga yeah
This want yall want
Octobers Very Own
Young Money
ATF
Thank Me Later in this bitch wasssup
Free Weezy in this bitch wassup
June fifteenth in this bitch wassupIntro Drake
Yesterday when we were gettin high
You were invited you wouldve liked it
Uh-uh-I-I know you all too well
I said that we can kiss the past goodbye
But you werent excited theres no way to fight it
You could stay but shorty here I go
Termanology
Termanology uh
They call me one thing but they treat me like another
Im cheatin but do I love her well more than any other
So its personal to paint you this type of picture
When your wife is like your sister seems you barely ever miss her
But another dude kiss her you lose it you wanna diss her
Wanna hit her like you hope no one do to your sister
Go figure I aint got a missus
They say its none of yo biz when them boys call their miss
And the halls shatterin cause life is like a battlefield
And yall battlin cause you got you a rapper deal
So I guess you start feelin how those rappers feel
Raw dog hope she go and get that mornin after pill
But if she get knocked up you gon have to peel
Or your career gonna be pushin up daffodils
Take care of yo kid go check your mistress
Hit the lab and record go handle your business
What type of life is this So many different choices
Too many different opinions too many different voices
What am I afriad of just to say love
I love you baby but this is what Im made of
And Ima be me cause I cant be no other
So I dont know if Aaliyahs gettin a little brother
But all I know is I already got one baby mother
And thats too much trouble sorry I cant love you
What am I afraid of
This is supposed to be what dreams are made of
But people I dont have the time to hang with
Always look at me and say the same shit
They say - you promised me you would never change
Ohh oh oh ohh oh oh ohh
You promised me you would never change
Ohh oh oh ohh oh oh ohh ohhhhh
Drake
Uhh am I wrong for makin light of my situation Clap on
When forty got some shit for me to snap on
Now that Im on I dont really wanna worry bout gettin back on
Im just tryin to stay on get my fuckin buffet on
I heard they just moved my grandmother to a nursin home
And Ill be actin like I dont know how to work a phone
But hit redial youll see that I just called
Some chick I met at the mall that I barely know at all
And plus this woman that I messed with unprotected
Textin sayin she wish she woulda kept it
The one that Im layin next to just looked over and read it
Man I couldnt tell you where the fuck my head is Im holdin on by a thread its
Like Im high right now the guy right now
And you could tell by lookin in my eyes right now
That nothin really comes as a surprise right now
Cause we just havin the time of our lives right now
Chorus
Drake
Well alright uhh
I live by some advices girl Lisa told me
The other day Lisa told me that she miss the old me
Uh which made me question when I went missin
And when I start treatin my friends different
Maybe it was the fast-paced switch-up
Or the two guns in my face durin the stick-up
Maybe cause a girl I thought I trusted was who set the whole shit up
Or the fact I havent seen em since they locked Big Rich up
I know but same time Im quick to forget
Im bout to roll me up a blunt with my list of regrets
Burn it all burn it all Im startin it fresh
Cause half the time I got it right I probably guessed
Did I just trade free time for camera time
Will I blow all of this money baby Hammer Time
Yeah I just need some closure
Aint no turnin back for me Im in it til its overTake what you want take what you want
Take what you want take what you want
But you gotta share it with the world
Take what you want take what you want
Take what you want take what you want
But you gotta share it with the world
Take what you want take what you want
Take what you want take what you want
But you gotta share it with the world
Lately Ive been murdering and avoiding conviction
This shit is like an addiction conflicting with what I do
Shout out to K Davis and my connect up at Avis
Cause every weekend Im rollin out stuntin in somethin new
Fortunately I am at an elevated level
Im celebrated at home and
I am high above it all
But apologies to my fans that be super conscious
Just wait til I get my money right and
I am going to ball ball ball
Take what you want take what you want
Take what you want take what you want
But you gotta share it with the world
Take what you want take what you want
Take what you want take what you want
But you gotta share it with the world
Take what you want take what you want
Take what you want take what you want
But you gotta share it with the worldim good i dont need no help
cuz im better off by myself
then to start over with somebody else
and baby its easy for you to go and give your heart to someone new but im goodeith just dwelling home memoriesBridge
I know way too many people here right now
That I didnt know last year who the fuck are yall
I swear it feels like the last few nights
We been everywhere back
But I just cant remember it all
Chorus
What am I doin What am I doin
Oh yeah thats right Im doin me
Im doin me
Im livin life right now mayne
And this what Ima do til its over
Til its over
But its far from over
Bottles on me long as someone drink it
Never drop the ball fuck are yall thinkin
Makin sure the Young Money ship is never sinkin
Bout to set it off in this bitch Jada Pinkett
I shouldntve drove tell me how Im gettin home
You too fine to be layin down in bed alone
I could teach you how to speak my language Rosetta Stone
I swear this life is like the sweetest thing Ive ever known
Bout to go Thriller Mike Jackson on these niggas
All I needs a fucking red jacket with some zippers
Super good smiddoke a package of the swishers
I did it overnight it couldnt happen any quicker
Yall know them Well fuck it me either
But point the biggest skeptic out Ill make him a believer
It wouldnt be the first time I done it throwin hundreds
When I should be throwin ones bitch I run it Ahhhh
Bridge
I know way too many people here right now
That I didnt know last year who the fuck are yall
I swear it feels like the last few nights
We been everywhere back
But I just cant remember it all
Chorus
What am I doin What am I doin
Oh yeah thats right Im doin me
Im doin me
Im livin life right now mayne
And this what Ima do til its over
Til its over
But its far from over
One thing bout music when it hits you feel no pain
And I swear I got that shit that make these bitches go insane
So they tell me that they love me I know better than that its just game
Its just what comes with the fame and Im ready for that Im just sayin
But I really cant complain everything is kosher
Two thumbs up Ebert and Roeper
I really cant see the end getting any closer
But I prolly still be the man when everything is over
So Im riding through the city with my high beams on
Can you see me Can you see me Get your Vizsine on
Yall just do not fit the picture turn your widescreen on
If you thinkin Ima quit before I die dream on
Man they treat me like a legend am I really this cold
Im really too young to be feelin this old
Its about time you admit it who you kiddin man
nobodys never done it like I did it Ahh
Bridge
I know way too many people here right now

Chorus

And this what Ima do til its over
Til its over
But its far from overWho else really try to mess with Hollywood Cole
treating Birmingham like my Hollywood shows
Im tryin to tell you something that you prolly should know
this that slumdog millionaire Bollywood flow
and ahh my real friends never hearing from me
fake friends write the wrong answers on the mirror for me
Thats why I pick and choose I dont get s confused
Im not with different crews
We walk the same paths but got on different shoes
We live in the same building but we got different views
I got a couple cars I never get to lose
Dont like my women single I like my chicks in twos
And these days all the girls is down to roll
We hit the strip club and all them girls find a pole
Tell your girl to tell her friend that its time to go
Tell me todays weather
I know they say they good but trust me Im better
I sound like the coldest Miami night ever
Im cold but still hot you cant decide on a sweater
really this whatever and I am murdering and this is so amusing
If theres a sight to see I am an illusion
I tell you Im the man baby what is the confusion
and if they still sleeping on me someone hit the snooze then
Keep sleeping while I sell a couple million
Im headed for the moon I aint bout to hit the ceiling
Im about to hit the club women tell me Im appealing
But f what they say let me tell you how Im feeling
Im drinking these London street lamps got a real glow
Drizzy playin driving fast but it feels slow
And ask your man hes a hater baby he dont know
I could kick a punt and turn that s into a field goal
This here was meant to get buried
I got a lot of things I mention those barely
I aint lyin to the kids like the dentist aint scary
Im what Lebron was to St Vince and St Mary
but I aint playin high school games
pulling McClarens through a McDonalds drive through lane
Im too fly keep it hip-hop like afu raa
Girl on that McClaren you gotta lift the doors
Blades chopping through the city streets liquid swordsYesterday when we were getting high you were invited
You wouldve liked it I-I know you all too well
I said that we could kiss the past goodbye
But you werent excited theres no way to fight it
You can stay but shawty here I go
Uh should I spend the weekend in Vegas
Im living inside a moment not taking pictures to save it
I mean how could I forget My memories never faded
I cant relate to these haters my enemies never made it
I am still here with who I started with
The game needed life I put my heart in it
I blew myself up Im on some martyr shit
Carried the weight for my city like a cargo ship
Uh Im twenty-three with a money tree
Growing more too I just planted a hundred seeds
Its ironic cause my mother was a florist
And thats how she met my pops and now my garden is enormous
Its happening Penny Lane just like you said
I avoided the Coke game and went with Sprite instead
Uh huh thats word to the millions that they putting up
Im trying to do better than good enough
What am I afraid of This is suppose to be what dreams are made of
But people I dont have the time to hang with
Always look at me and say the same shit they say
You promised me you would never change
You promised me you would never change
Uh Am I wrong for making light of my situation Clap on
When forty got some shit for me to snap on
Now that Im on I dont really want to worry about getting back on
Im just trying to stay on get my fucking buffet on
I heard they just moved my grandmother to a nursing home
And I be acting like I dont know how to work a phone
But hit redial you see that I just called some chick I met at the mall
That I barley know at all and
Plus this woman that I messed with unprotected
Texting saying that she wish she wouldve kept it
The one that Im laying next to just looked over and read it
Man I couldnt tell you where the fuck my head is
Im holding on by a thread its
Like Im high right now the guy right now
And you can tell by looking in my eyes right now
That nothing really comes as a surprise right now
cause we just having the time of our lives right now
What am I afraid of This is suppose to be what dreams are made of
But people I dont have the time to hang with
Always look at me and say the same shit they say
You promised me you would never change
You promised me you would never change
Well all right Uh I live by some advices girl Lisa told me
The other day Lisa told that she missed the old me
Which made me question when I went missing
And when I start treating my friends different
Maybe it was the fast paced switch up
Or the two guns in my face during the stick up
Maybe cause the girl I thought I trusted was who set the whole shit up
Or the fact I havent seen em since they locked Big Rich up
I know At the same time Im quick to forget
Im bout to roll me up a blunt with my list of regrets
Burn it all burn it all Im starting it fresh
Cause half the time I got it right I probably guessed
Did I just trade free time for camera time
Will I blow all of this money baby Hammer Time
I just need some closure

Hair weave killer known to snatch the fucking track out
Put me in the game coach Im the antidote
Pull up kick throw and take the money and the dope

My sense of judgment is a officially gone
Up into the air all the smoke from the swisha is blown
Ahh Im grown Im grown Im living in this elevator zone alone

I got pent house walls I stay high above your ass
And I can see it all my balcony is glass

Super trooper like a gun tote in candyman
Ask me how Im livin bet I tell ya fine and dandy man
Check his vital signs they peeping off the meter man

Cause my pop was in it so deep
If his son wanted in it these dealers would probably drop percentage
Instead I drop bars like Im two months sober
Its my time now so them you months over
Yeah if I want it I find me a way to get that
Im trying to get to the point where I can sit back
Took a lot of patience and action
I grind so Im anticipating relaxing
Im thinking bout replacing the Jacksons on top of the charts
I dont need brothers fillin space in the back than
So from the kid with the sun tan flow
The hottest ticket in town to this one man show
Chorus
I think that you know as well as I know
Bitches checkin for me every where that I go
What you gotta understand that its me I be
Until the motherfucking day that I DIE
repeat
I can easily makeem admit to bounce back
Without knowing exactly where my accounts at
Yeah you best believe that I often
So they dont like me and throw parties and yet they never invite me
I cant lie sometime it bother me slightly
Either way the true fans yell
I appear calm and its obvious so who can tell
And no this aint Blu Cantrell
This is like perfection though we both got the light complexion
Couple things that I do that well
And the way that I Jack-son you think that Drake new Sam-el As in Samual Jackson
Ive been real though
They stay kicking it with me like a field goal
See Im humble but I live vain
With more deals on the table than a
ChorusI know way too many people here right now

And this what Im a do til its over
Til its over
But its far from over
Bottles on me long as someone drink it
Never drop the ball fuck are yall thinkin
Makin sure the Young Money ship is never sinkin
Bout to set it off in this bitch Jada Pinkett
I shouldntve drove tell me how Im gettin home
You too fine to be layin down in bed alone
I could teach you how to speak my language Rosetta Stone
I swear this life is like the sweetest thing Ive ever known
Bout to go Thriller Mike Jackson on these niggas
All I needs a fucking red jacket with some zippers
Super good smiddoke a package of the swishers
I did it overnight it couldnt happen any quicker
Yall know them Well fuck it me either
But point the biggest skeptic out Ill make him a believer
It wouldnt be the first time I done it throwin hundreds
When I should be throwin ones bitch I run it Ah
I know way too many people here right now
That I didnt know last year who the fuck are yall
I swear it feels like the last few nights
We been everywhere and back

And this what Im a do til its over
Til its over
But its far from over
One thing bout music when it hits you feel no pain
And I swear I got that shit that make these bitches go insane
So they tell me that they love me I know better than that its just game
Its just what comes with the fame and Im ready for that Im just sayin
But I really cant complain everything is kosher
Two thumbs up Ebert and Roeper
I really cant see the end getting any closer
But I probly still be the man when everything is over
So Im riding through the city with my high beams on
Can you see me Can you see me Get your Visine on
Yall just do not fit the picture turn your widescreen on
If you thinkin Im a quit before I die dream on
Man they treat me like a legend am I really this cold

Its about time you admit it who you kiddin man
Man nobodys never done it like I did it Ugh

I swear it feels like the last few nights
We been everywhere and back

But its far from over
Yeah thats right Im doin me

Im livin life right now mayne
And this what Im a do til its over
Til its over
But its far from overI told the world one day I would pay it back
Say it on tape and lay it record it so that one day I could play it back
But I dont even know if I believe it when Im saying that
Doubt startin to creep in everyday its just so grey and black
Hope I just need a ray of that
Cause no one sees my vision
When I play it for em they just say its whack
But they dont know what dope is
And I dont know if I was awake or asleep when I wrote this
All I know is you came to me when I was at my lowest
You picked me up breathed new life in me I owe my life to you
But for the life of me I dont see why you dont see like I do
But it just dawned on me you lost a son Demons fightin you its dark
Let me turn on the lights and brighten me and enlighten you
I dont think you realize what you mean to me not the slightest clue
Cause me and you were like a crew I was like your sidekick
You gon either wanna fight when I get off this f-cking mic
Or you gon hug me But Im out of options theres nothing else I can do causeDrake - Verse one
Word on road its the clique about to blow
You aint gotta run and tell nobody they already know
Weve been living on a high theyve been talking on a low
But its cool know you heard it all before

Only on camera only on camera
It look like we in love but only on camera

Drake - Verse one
Uh you know you know how the story goes
You done jocked my style you done stole my flow
You done seen me out you gets no hello
And you wonder why Man you know you know
Yeah and you should let them boys know too
Show them niggas every single thing I showed you
Im here feeling like fifty back in two and everybody sayin Im the man so true
Yeah but what does it take to feel secure
A place with wooden floors and space to put awards
A couple of parking spots and maids to do the chores
The cars you always wanted the women that you adore
Well I got it I got it
I wonder if Id be happy without it I doubt it
I try not to really think about it
I made it but im still playin like im bein scouted til im outted
Game time bitch I hope youre proud of us
King James shit watch me throw the powder up
This OG got my whole suite cloudin up
And I bet you I be out of time before Im out of luck
They aint rootin for me they aint clappin for me
Im only sayin can somebody just be happy for me
I really hate to say I told you so
So I bite my tongue but you know you know
Hook
Drake - Verse two
Uhh please make your long story shorter
Cause time is of the essence for the king of first quarter
Numbers do the talkin I have nothing for reporters
I just hope we make these flights and dont get held up at the border
Yeah so you can spare me all the accolades
Im the reason you can find my city on an atlas page
Half a million dollars later and my taxes paid
And Im still spendin money from my actin days
Damn life is such a lovely thing
Feel the perks that a seven figure budget bring
Tell your girlfriend that I can pull some fuckin strings
So were courtside when LeBron get a fuckin ring
Yeah I bet I be there I be there
You see that sixty-two sittin outside Thats me there
Im jumpin to the top its my leap year prepare
Putting in that overtime I never said itd be fair
Im always left wishin I could have done it in person
My apologies to all of the ones I was hurtin
I got new girls but none of they love is for certain
And call old girls but none of they numbers are workin
Damn what happened to us
Life can always change you have to adjust
How come when I got a party you stare at me in disgust
They pay us just to have fun you should see that as a plus
Especially when I come flyin through the door
And kindly ignore the paparazzi outside tryin to record
Why has every woman never dined here before
Am I the only twenty-three year old wine connoisseur
The Rothschilds the Crus the Gajas and the Opuses
Its always nice when youre out with someone that notices
My condo got that art gallery openness
Im just really hopin that that isnt what the motive is
They aint rooting for me they aint clapping for me
Im only sayin can somebody just be happy for me
I really hate to say I told you so
So I bite my tongue but you know you know

Do I Do I Do I Do
Uhh Please Put Away The Cameras
Cause We Just In The Club Gettin MC Hammered
And God Forbid We Ever Trade Our Wisdom For The Glamour

So Make One I Know That You Can Make Me One
I Just Want A Woman That Looks Thirty When Shes Eighty One
Please Dont Give It All Away I Hope That You Can Save Me Some
The More They Pass Their Heart Around The More Jaded That They Become

Tell The Reverend All That Were Missin Is His Blessin
Cause Before She Pop The Pssy
She Need Me To Pop The Question
So We Exchange Vowels
They Clap We Take A Bow
And Shell Be Doin Tricks For Daddy When We Take It To The HouseAll my exes live in Texas like Im George Strait
Or they go to Georgia State where
Tuition is handled by some random nigga that live in Atlanta
That she only see when she feels obligated
Admitted it to me the first time we dated
But she was no angel and we never waited
I took her for sushi she wanted to fuck
So we took it to go told them dont even plate it
And we never talk too much after I blew up
Just only hello or happy belated
And I think I text her and told her I made it
And thats when she text me and told me she prayed it
And thats when I text her and told her I love it
And right after texting told her Im faded
She asked
What have I learned since getting richer
I learned working with the negatives could make for better pictures
I learned Hennessey and enemies is one hell of a mixture
Even though its fucked up girl Im still fucking wit ya
Damn is it the fall
Time for me to revisit the past
Its women to call
Theres albums to drop theres liquor involved
Theres stories to tell we been through it all
Interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my dressing room confusing me with questions
Like
Do you love this shit
Are you high right now
Do you ever get nervous
Are you single
I heard you fucked your girl is it true
You getting money You think them niggas you with is wit you
And I say
And I say Hell yeah
Hell yeah hell yeah
Fuckin right
Fuckin right all right
And we say Hell yeah
Hell yeah hell yeah
Fuckin right
Fuckin right all right
So much for being optimistic
They say love is in the air so I
Hold my breath until my face turn purple
Keep a few bad bitches in my circle
My nuts hang like aint no curfew
Bitch if you wave then I will surf you
I flew jet she flew commercial
But we still met later that night
After my session she came over
I was aggressive and she was sober
I gave her pills
She started confessing and started undressing
And ask me to hold her
And so I did but that was last month
And now shes texting me asking for closure
Damn
She say this shit gon catch up to me
I keep tissue paper
We eat each other whenever we at the dinner table
She say she hate that she love me
And she wish I was average
Shit sometimes I wish the same
And I wish she wasnt married
Promises I hope I never break em
Met a female dragon had a fire conversation but
Interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my bedroom confusing me with questions like
Do you love this shit
Are you high right now
Do you ever get nervous
Are you single
I heard you fucked your girl is it true
You getting money You think them niggas you with is wit you

Exotic red-bottom sole body glitter in gold
Follwin fundamentals Im followin in a rental

That money triple up when you get it out of state
Need a new safe cause Im runnin out of space
Elroy Jetson Im somewhere outta space
In my two-seater she the one that I will take
Bobbin to the music

Mr KFC VVS is in the watch
Livin fast where its all about that money bag
Never front you take it there aint no coming back
Top down right here is where she wanna be
As my goals unfold right in front of me
Every time we fuck her soul take a hold of me

Pink bottles keep comin
James Bond coup pop-clutch one hundred

They say that all of yo old girls got somebody new
I say damn really even Rosemary even Leanne Seely
They said fuckin right they were the onest to go
Its nothing personal
its just that all of them women you slept on were working though
they was saving up
New niggas came around theyve been waking up with
I swear you dont know this city anymore
They mightve loved you before
But youre out here doing your thing
They dont know you
Sure they do theyre just not as sincere
Its crazy all the emotions forgot in a year
She like why you even give a fuck you not even here
Well out there there aint nothing for me and I think I need to come home
Chorus
Tell me who did I leave behind
You think you got to me
I can just read your mind
You think Im so caught up in where
I am right now
But believe I remember it all
I be with my nigga chubbs
he in love with street shit
No wonder why I feel awkward at this fashion week shit
No wonder why I keep fucking up the double cheek kiss
Along for that ignorant Young Money Miami beach shit
A couple of artists got words for me thats never fun
They say its on when they see me that day dont ever come
Im never scared they never real I never run
When all is said and done more is always said than done
And I was told once things will change
by a nigga named tip when my deal came
Told me its all good even when it feels strange
Now Im the guy that know strippers by they real names
Rochelle Jordanne thick bitches they just talked me out of four grand
How did a pile of kush become the mountain of truth
How did a bottle of wine become the fountain of youth
Damn my biggest fear is losing it all
Remember how I used to feel at the start of it
And now Im living a muthafuckin fairy tale
And still trying to keep you feeling a part of it
Yea just lie to my ears
tell me it feel the same its all Ive been dying to hear
Lights get low and thats when I have my brightest ideas
And I heard my city feel better than ever
thats why I gotta come home
Chorus
Tell me who did I leave behind
You think you got to me
I can just read your mind
You think Im so caught up in where
I am right now
But believe I remember it all
My mother is back to who she was years ago
Its like a new page me and her are beginning on
I wish she stopped checking up on women I cant stand
cause I got new girls I could use her opinion on
She thinks Ive become a slave to the wealth
But Ill never break the promises I made to myself
And I would never make up names for myself
Then change the names that I just gave to myself
Certain rappers would call me to say wat up tho
I used to brag about it to my friends and now Im feeling like all of these niggas cutthroat
And maybe thats all they do is just pretend damn
But I bought it though I believed it
Yea I thought it and I achieved it
Yea so show me love show me fucking love
cause I thought it was all I needed
Yea Clearly I was wrong about it all along
And this will be the year that I wont even feel shit
They trip about the amount of people I brought along
But Im just trying to be surrounded by some real shit
Need credentials for everyone of these Toronto kids
I promise they see it with me we just tryna live
I told em we bout to get it and we finally did
Listen closely to my shit I swear it sounded like home
Chorus
Tell me who did I leave behind
You think you got to me
I can just read your mind
You think Im so caught up in where
I am right now
But believe I remember it all
Outro - Bob Marley
Endchillin with no make on thats when your the prettiest I hope you dont take it wrongcan tell that moneys got you working
Weve been talking for so long

Drake Verse one
I let the beat bang

Honestly the honesty is why the game love us
My women either centerfolds or on the main covers
Stunt so hard I make these niggas hate summer
And pray for winter
But when its winter time
Im still waitin on these niggas at the finish line
We just took our first trip to the Amalfi Coast
Couple days on the beach
Then its adiios
Killa
Just look at what I done alone
You would swear we planted trees the way the moneys grown
We been busy like some bees no honeycomb
And you could probably feel the breeze when the moneys blown
Pardon my towel and flip flop phase

Even when Im not functioning in tip top shape
I could bench as much as hip hop weighs

Nipsey Hussle Verse two
Before rap

What was once gray skies
Is now white clouds
And I did it with the ones yall said was not the right crowd
Follow my steps
And you see what Im bout

From Chuck Taylors on the pavement with the blammers out
Then I hit the league straight out the streets with no talent scout
And now my face bring the cameras out
That young nigga these industry bitches yap about
You know the one the cops bunk you up and ask about
All because I took my wildest dreams and then mapped em out
I go for mine like its overtime
Me and my niggas had to struggle so we over-shine
Been fuck bitches

Cuz on a mission your worst enemy is idle time

Bout to go Thriller Mike Jackson on these niggas
All I needs a fucking red jacket with some zippers
Super good smiddoke a package of the swishers

One thing bout music when it hits you feel no pain
And I swear I got that shit that make these bitches go insane
So they tell me that they love me I know better than that its just game
Its just what comes with the fame and Im ready for that Im just sayin
But I really cant complain everything is kosher
Two thumbs up Ebert and Roeper
I really cant see the end getting any closer
But I probly still be the man when everything is over
So Im riding through the city with my high beams on
Can you see me Can you see me Get your Visine on
Yall just do not fit the picture turn your widescreen on
If you thinkin Im a quit before I die dream on

For my niggas though
You underestimated greatly
Most number ones ever how long did it really take me
The part I love most is they need me more than they hate me
So they never take shots I got everybody on safety
I could load every gun with bullets that fire backwards
You probably wouldnt lose a single rapper
Niggas make threats cant hear em over the laughter
Yeah thats cause Im headed to the bank nigga
Sinatra lifestyle Im just being Frank with you
I mean where you think she at when she aint with you
Wildin doin shit thats way out of your budget
Owl sweaters inside her luggage you gotta love it
Damn this shit could go on a tape
Bitches lovin my drive I never give it a break
Give these niggas the look the verse and even the hook
Thats why every song sound like Drake featuring Drake
Straight Y pree Why is it always me
Got us watchin our words like theres wire taps on the team
Cause I show love never get the same outta niggas
Guess its funny how money can make change outta niggas
For real
Some nobody started feelin himself
A couple somebodies started killin themself
A couple albums dropped those are still on the shelf
I bet them shits would have popped if I was willin to help
I got a gold trophy from the committee for validation
Bad press during the summer over allegations
I aint lyin my nigga my time is money
Thats why I aint got time for a nigga whos time is comin
A lot of niggas PR stuntin like thats the movement
And Im the only nigga still known for the music
I swear fuck them niggas this year
I made Forbes list nigga
Fuck your list everythings lookin gorgeous
Without me rap is just a bunch of orphans
But if I stay in the shit theres a bunch of corpses
And me and my dread nigga from New Orleans
Stashin money like hoarders off multi-platinum recordings
Eat it like Im seated at Swish Sotto and Josos
Nothing Was The Same this shit for Easy and Cocoa
This shit for Kareem this shit for Jaevon
This shit for Julius Milly Mill
Boy we do this shit for real
All them boys in my will
All them boys is my Wills
Anything happen to pop and I got you like Uncle Phil
Weezy been on that edge you niggas just need to chill
If anything happen to papi might pop a nigga for real
Comin live from the screwface livin out a suitcase
But Im feelin good Johnny got me pushin two plates
My weight up I refuse to wait up I started a new race
Its funny when you think a nigga blew up after Lupe
Niggas treat me like Ive been here for ten
Some niggas been here for a couple never been here again
Im on my King James shit Im tryin to win here again
A young nigga tryin to win here again

Youll be rocking one of the rings you pointed out while shopping with a nigga dont lie
Shes losing it right now cause if I wasnt who I am she wouldve been moving in by now
But instead were moving slow I guess shes used to it by now
And she gives me all her trust and Im abusing it right now
But this money coming in is just confusing shit right now
You just told me I aint shit and I guess Im proving it right now
I say Id rather be with you but you are not around
So Imma call somebody up and see if they be down
Cause I hate sleeping alone I hate sleeping alone
Half the time we dont end up fucking I dont ask her for nothing
You leave me in the morning I dont see her for months
But I just hate sleeping alone I hate sleeping alone
So shes here and were both so gone
Hotel to hotel girl I could use your company
Full name and birthday I book a flight you come to me
But she dont want a weekend she wants all of me or none of me
If she cant work with all of me then she say she done with me
You say that you over me you always end up under me
You know how it goes dont be crazy dont play dumb with me
Dont start with yo shit I put you back in yo place
She tells me I bet you wont you wont say that to my face
And hang up yeah how dare you tell me its tougher for you
Like I dont hear about the niggas you fucking with too
And whoever I be with they got nothing on you
Thats just something to do when theres nothing to do
Yeah but shes losing it right now
She has choices she should make I think shes choosing it right now
One more chance to make it right I think Im using it right now
You just said I never learn I guess Im proving it right now
I say Id rather be with you but you are not around
So Imma call somebody up and see if they be down
Cause I hate sleeping alone I hate sleeping alone
Half the time we dont end up fucking I dont ask her for nothing
You leave me in the morning I dont see her for months
But I just hate sleeping alone I hate sleeping alone

Drake - Verse one
I got car money fresh start money

And all I care about is my city man I cant say it enough

Kick game run game run it real good
But never ever have my bitches sittin courtside
Same nigga that you knew way back when
You actin like its somebody you dont know
Tell me how the f-ck we supposed to stay friends
When you got a bunch of feelings that you dont show
I can tell I can tell I can tell certain people dont like me no more
New shit dont excite me no more
Guess they dont really make em like me no more
Uh you can look me in my eyes and see I aint myself
Cause if I was what yall created then Id hate myself
But still let them girls in
And tell em all leave their cell phones on the table where we see em
Im all day with it man AM to the PM
Niggas hatin I just wish they would say it when I see em all
Thats that shit that drives me crazy
And its all that Ive been gettin lately
And its probably why Im scared to put the time in
Women wanna f-ck like their me and Im them
Looking for some things and I think I can find it in you in you

The team that I belong to
Tha artists I put on wit
Dont ever ask for nothin cause them niggaz got they own shit
Me n Weezy like a mouthful of hot peppers
Black Ferrari with the red seats
I call it playin checkers
Im never doing verses
Im forever giving lectures
If youre tryna meet with money
Id be happy to connect ya
Life is better than its ever been
Scheduling million dollar meetings with the president
Someone cut the lights on
Where is Thomas Edison
Got a new condo watch me as I settle in
I deserve a MTV show for me and my people
And if you tryna zone I got a whole swisha sweet full
Rappers are liars and they women are deceitful
Adding till they subtract me I never be a equal
Last place Drizzy is the nigga in the lead now
Weezy told me just write every single thing you need down
Then he got it for me and Im happy as can be now
Bout to start ballin like Im coming off ofa rebound
Yea
And I should have the most bragging rights
Because a nigga spit crack bag it tight
Hate when rappers say they tryna get they swagger right
Cause I done came wit mo fire than a dragon fight
Fuck you pussy ass hater you should do you
You aint heard of me then you should go and get a Blues Clue
Oops I mean a red clue
Waynes here su WOO

But I aint banging I aint waving no flag
Im ATF but they aint seein no badge
Its heartbreak Drake I hate to see em so sad
I could son you see a little me in yo dad

Can pocket twenty thousand to be anywhere they ask me
Cash like Johnny Banks like Ashley
Burning like a Camel Light

Stop and let me tell you bout a plan I have for you
Take all the leaders from around the world
Put them together in a great big ring
Televise it as the lowest show on earth
And let them fight like hell to see whos king
Gather up the pieces when the fight is done
Then youll find out living really can be fun
The next thing I say to you will be true the last thing I said was false
Remember to do nothing when you dont know what to do you
You wanted a world you could figure out
But something happened while you were asleep
You wanted a good life you could brag about
Too bad they took the parts you wanted to keep

That was such a lie
Every time you said you loved me you cant look me in my eyes
And I beg you for the truth so much goin thru my mind
And my father did just pass to make my problems multiply
And I know nobodys perfect but you finally crossed the line
And I gave you everything but you was never satisfied
And you said I was the one just like you told another five
Feel like its a competition against all these other guys
Texted me the other night its been too long
Always tryna figure out if Ima move on
Staring at the ceiling almost all night long
Probably why I had the time to write this song
Texted me the other night its been too long
Always tryna figure out if Ima move on
Staring at the ceiling almost all night long
Probably why I had the time to write this song
Every time I see you feels like time is moving slow
Its unfortunate for me I have some trouble letting go
Even though its in the past I just felt like you should know
And you hate me when I get high but youre the reason that I smoke
Girl quit playin
Girl quit playin
You aint love me from the start
Youre the reason that I feel this way
You broke my fuckin heart
And I gave you all my trust but you just tore it all apart
Now youre all I think about while Im layin in the dark
Texted me the other night its been too long
Always tryna figure out if Ima move on
Staring at the ceiling almost all night long
Probably why I had the time to write this song
Texted me the other night its been too long
Always tryna figure out if Ima move on
Staring at the ceiling almost all night long
Probably why I had the time to write this song
Been a couple months and youre beggin for me back
And I love all the attention Im not sure how I should act
And youre saying that you miss me I refuse to say it back
Even though I still do want you I dont have the time for that
Cause these women stay the same while this niggas chasin cash
And your problems are so small girl just trust me they aint bad
Cause you cryin bout a nigga while Im cryin bout my dad
And its eating me alive shouldve taken me instead
Texted me the other night its been too long
Always tryna figure out if Ima move on
Staring at the ceiling almost all night long
Probably why I had the time to write this song
Texted me the other night its been too long
Always tryna figure out if Ima move on
Staring at the ceiling almost all night long
Probably why I had the time to write this songVerse one drake
I have to watch the road
I swear that every car that passes has you in it
I cant believe were finished
My life is movin fast
The time will often pass
And something will remind me
I cant put this behind me
I thought you wouldve called by now by now
You couldve had my all by now by now
Its been too many years for you to disappear
And have me asking the question
Hook
I wonder whatever became of you
Although its not that Im surprised its not I didnt try
Its not that I was frightened of you
Although I said all goodbyes
And you had all your cries
I wonder whatever became of you
I wonder whatever became of you
I wonder whatever became of you
I swear I heard you call
But when I heard youd gone
I hate that I looked desperate
You gone is like me naked
Im steering not to crash
Trying to make it last
Keep looking close behind me
My eyesight on a memory
I thought you wouldve called by now by now
You could have all my love right now by now
Gave into my fears
While you just disappeared
Thats why Im asking this question
Hook
I wonder whatever became of you
Although its not that Im surprised its not I didnt try
Its not that I was frightened of you
Although I said all goodbyes
And you had all your cries
I wonder whatever became of you
I wonder whatever became of you
I wonder whatever became of you
I cant go to bed
Thinking about my goals
And how we used to say a goal is just a dream with a deadline
Where did the other half of my heart go
Why am I in bed alone
How come when I drive by it looks like you are never home
Do you even live there
Or did you take a u-haul
Too far move off and not even tell me that youre gone
We were on fire
Somehow that fire cooled off burnt out
I kept straight but I wonder how you turned out
Hook
I wonder whatever became of you
Although its not that Im surprised its not I didnt try
Its not that I was frightened of you
Although I said all goodbyes
And you had all your cries
I wonder whatever became of you
I wonder whatever became of you
I wonder whatever became of youWelcome to the future

But they crave attention though they always saying Show me something

My demons visit me every night
To the most high Im forever indebted
I know I gotta pay something I know that days coming
I put it all in the music
Because if I dont say it here then I wont say nothing
Could feel my hand getting tired from holding the grudges
Two birds one stone my aim is amazing
I need to start losing my shit
Just to show you niggas who hatin
Too reserved like I called ahead for me and my lady
Free Cfive how the fuck we got the boss waiting
Ever since the blue basement I found God and I lost patience
Between rocks and hard places of all places
Spotted everywhere like Dalmatian
Cops snoop around now cause all my dogs famous
Please welcome the October fall baby
Vaughan Road Academy star player my minds not all there
Used to carry a lot of dead weight like a pallbearer
People too scared to tell the truth so its all dares
Counted us all there and we all square
Quick money Im in and out
My dad used to use a soap bar til its thinning out
But shit look at Dennis now
All Stacy Adams and linnend out
More blessings for Sandy and him more life
My parents never got it right but
God bless em both I think we all alike
We all wide awake late at night thinking on what to change
If we do get to do it twice in a another life
Scared to go to sleep now
Cause being awake is what all my dreams were like
Back when the bar I set for myself was out of sight
Tell me how I went and did chin ups
On this shit when I cant see it
Pin ups of Meagan Good and Pam Grier soul sisters
Inspired my old scriptures
Now that feeling gone like them old pictures
Mixing liquors got us both twisted
Words get so vicious you just stare at me
While you roll Swishers
Girl I love you but I dont miss you
And no matter what year it is Im an sixer
Go figure cold nigga stay in school man
Fuck the rap game its all lies and its all filthy
two percent of us rich and the rest of these niggas all milk it
Got two of my niggas off with a not guilty
Gave back to the city and never said it
If I didnt live it but still they try to tell you Im not the realest
Like Im some privileged kid that never sat through a prison visit
Or like it was just handed to me tied with a ribbon
I never worked to get it
But really its you with all the drug dealer stories
Thats gotta stop though
You made a couple chops and now you think you Chapo
If you ask me though you aint lining the trunk with kilos
You bagging weed watching Pacino with all your niggas
Like this what we need to be on but you never went live
You middle man in this shit boy you was never them guys
I can tell cause I look most of you dead in your eyes
And youll be trying to sell that story for the rest of your lives
Cant show us where the cash is
Me I dont judge Im just going off what the math is
Numbers inflated
They all look at me like What have you done for me lately
I like your older shit but wasnt in love with the latest
Aw baby stop debating Im just a creative
My numbers out of this world
No wonder they got me feeling so alienated
You were the man on the moon
Now you just go through your phases
Life of the angry and famous
Rap like I know Im the greatest
Then give you tropical flavors
Still never been on hiatus
You stay xanned and perked up
So when reality set in you dont gotta face it
Im down two hundred in Vegas but winning life on a daily basis
It seems like nobody wants to stay in my good graces
Im like a real estate agent putting you all in your places
Look what happens soon as you talk to me crazy
Is you crazyBreaking news my niggas
If your girlfriend has went to any
Season opener basketball game
Best believe shes fucking some niggas on that team
Shes fucking somebody on the basketball team if shes at the game

Just to show the city what it takes to be alive for it
Cant get me on the line so they hang me out to dry for it
You know forty wants peace but Im down to cut ties for it
And I cant sleep these days unless I take one
If they dont have a story these days theyll make one
Life is always on man I never get a break from it
Doesnt matter where I go I can never get away from it

Are friends I dont have anymore
How do you not check on me when things go wrong
Guess I should have tried to keep my family closer much closer
All of my lets just be friends
Are friends I dont have anymore
Guess its what they say you need family for
Cause I cant depend on you anymore
Always saw you for what you could have been
Ever since you met me like when Chrysler made that one car
That looked just like a Bentley I
Always saw you for what you could have been
And even when its business with you its personal again
I knew you before you made ends meet
And now were meeting out end
And its all because you chose a side
Youre supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me
Guess it wasnt time
And of course you went and chose a side that wasnt mine
Your so predictable I hate people like you
Kennedy road taught me not to trust people like you
How you supposed to figure out what Im goin through
You cant even figure out whats going on with you
You judged me before you met me yeah it figures
I make all the players anthems for the real niggas
With my dad out in Tennessee is where I belong
Out here in LA I dont know whats going on
I dont know whats going on
And its all becase you chose a side
Youre supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me
Guess it wasnt time yeah
And of course you went and chose a side that wasnt mine
You sit and you pray hoping that the stars align
My luck is a sure thing cause Im living right
When I needed you you couldnt give me any advice
You always had something to say every other time
Everybody that I met on the way tries to get in the way
Im fooding and serving tomorrow like Im working minimum wage
Someone up there must just love testing my patience
Someone up there must be in need of some entertainment
Forgiveness for your ways
If I ever loved you Ill always love you thats how I was raised
Same way Im right here still feeling a way
Same way Im realizing on a day to day that

Redemptions on your mind when you think about me
Ah yeah yeah yeah
Redemptions on your mind when you
Ah please give me time
Cause Im searchin for these words to say to you right now
Damn Im not unrealistic with none of my women
I tell em if they aint with it then lets just forget it
Relationships slowin me down they slow down the vision
Guess Im not in a position to deal with commitment
Certain people need to tell me they proud of me
That mean a lot to me
Not havin closure it take a lot out of me
This year for Christmas I just want apologies
Sydney gave up on me when I went missin
Syd had a baby and treated me different
Erica sued me and opened a business
Wonder if they was here shit could have been different
Wonder what theyd do put in my position
I wonder when my shit drop do they listen
Wonder if they second guessin their decisions
I hate the number two that shit is unforgiven
Tryna satisfy everybody
Its like they cant get enough
Until enough is enough
And then its too much
You tip the scale when I weigh my options
West Palm girls are spoiled rotten
Tiffany on you you know you poppin
Ill kill somebody if they give you problems
Master bedrooms where we get it poppin
Just ignore all the skeletons in my closet
Im a walkin come-up Im a bank deposit
Sell my secrets and get top dollar
Sell my secrets for a Range Rover
Opportunity and temptation
They would sell my secrets for a tropical vacation
Sell my secrets back to me if I was payin
Whos gonna save me when I need savin
Since Take Care Ive been care-taking
But second chances that aint how you livin
Redemption on your mind Ill never be forgiving
Yeah I knowI should be downtown whipping on the way to you
You got something that belongs to me
Your body language says it all
Despite the things you said to me
Who is it thats got you all gassed up
Changing your opinion on me
I was only gone for the last few months
But you dont have the time to wait on me
I tried with you
Theres more to life than sleeping in
And getting high with you
I had to let go of us to show myself what I could do
And that just didnt sit right with you
And now youre trying to make me feel a way on purpose
Now youre throwing it back in my face on purpose
Now youre talking down on my name on purpose
And you dont feel no way you think I deserve it
Feel a way feel a way young nigga feel a way
Ive stopped listening to things you say
Cause you dont mean it anyway yeah
Feel a way feel a way young nigga feel a way
Maybe we should have just did things my way
Instead of the other way
I tried with you
Theres more than life than sleeping in
And getting high with you
I had to let go of us to show myself what I could do
And that just didnt sit right with you
And now youre trying to make me feel a way on purpose
Now youre throwing it back in my face on purpose
Now youre talking down on my name on purpose
And you dont feel no way you think I deserve itThis is all Gods doing man you cant plan it
But if the devils in the details then Im satanic

I dont feel the same
Anywhere I go
I cant help but know
I dont feel the same
Anywhere I go

Right
Weston Road Flows I did this shit for my nigga Renny
Back when we couldnt buy pizza cause we were down to pennies
Feel like we go back a century runnin to store for Centurys
And bring em back to your brother man we had to respect it
He was wavy doin mixtapes out of your basement
He let us hit the weed on occasion for entertainment
Then he would leave us at the house and go out on a mission
We probably wouldve got in less trouble just goin with him
Feel like I never say much but man theres a lot to know
Feel like the difference between us really startin to show
Im lookin at they first week numbers like what are those
I mean you boys not even coming close
I gave niggas like you a reason for celebration
You number one and Im Eddie Murphy we tradin places
Lookin in the mirror Im closer than I really appear
Creepin like Chilli without the tender love and care
No tender love and care and no love and affection
I got a price on my head but theres a risk to collect it
I might be here as a vessel to teach people a lesson
Feel like they wanted me dead but couldnt pull it together
Yeah but here we are and its a new semester
forty the only one that know how I deal with depression
A couple nights where it started to feel like the feelings faded
A lot of problems that cant be fixed with a conversation
Your best day is my worst day I get green like Earth Day
You treat me like Im born yesterday you forgot my birthday
You dont be scorin perfect you dont be workin like how we be workin
You platinium like wrappers on Hersheys boy that shit is worthless
You get the message over and over like it was urgent
And then act like you aint heard it when you see me in person
The only thing I did to end up here was put the work in
And did it with a purpose
Used to have secret handshakes to confirm my friendships
Nowadays they just shakin my hand to hide the tension
A lot of people just hit me up when my name is mentioned
Shout out to KD we relate we get the same attention
Its rainin money Oklahoma City Thunder
The most successful rapper thirty-five and under
Im assumin everybodys thirty-five and under
Thats when I plan to retire man its already funded
Yeah I brought your wifey out to St Maarten
She violated I sent her back where it all started
How quick they are to forget about they bachelor apartment
Leave it to niggas like you to show em light in the darkness
Told my momma that I found a lady in the east
Cancun when I got signed they upgraded the suite
Don Julio in the freezer that they gave us for free
I get you all you can eat just have some patience with me
You wouldnt tell me you loved me started seein Monique
Last time I heard from Monique T-Minus was makin beats
I used to hit the corner store to get Tahiti Treat
Now the talk at the corner store is Im TBE
The best ever dont ever question you know better
But shit aint always how it seems when its sowed together
Yeah I let that last line breathe it take a second to get it
Weston Road flows my confidence level gettin settled
Dont get hyped for the moment then start to back peddle
Dont let your new found fame fool you or cloud up your judgement
To talk loosely I really do this
Been flowin stupid since Vince Carter was on some through the legs arm in the hoop shit
Drinkin Hpnotiq with Glenn Lewis I been through it
Yall was so afraid to lay claim to it
Too busy face screwin on waste movements
You was ridin TTC metro I had the place boomin
First take Drake you know I rarely have to take two it
And they still take to it
Big Apple had the white Hummer parked right in front of Fluid
And we be walkin in that bitch like we already knew it
But money cant buy happiness Jelly talkin truthful
But Im happiest when I can buy what I want
Get high when I want
Yeah thats right
YeahI just love when Im with you yeah this shit is on ten
We used to be friends girl and even back then
You would look at me with no hesitation and youd tell me baby its yours
Nobody elses yeah this shit belong to nobody its yours
Nobody elses yeah this shit belong to nobody and that
What made me think about the game girl
And how I switched it up with a new thang
Young nigga came through on his Wu-Tang
And nowadays when I ask about who got it they say its yours
Nobody elses yeah this shit belong to nobody its yours
Nobody elses yeah this shit belong to nobody its yours
Its yours thats for sure
How you feel about coming home with a nigga for the night
If you nervous hit the lights I know we only fucking out of spite
Cause your man dont do you right do you right I could fuck you so good
Then I hit you with the nine am in Dallas who you like baby who you like
Machine gun raps for all my niggas in the back
Stadium packed just glad to see the city on the map
I just gave the city life it aint about who did it first
Its about who did it right niggas looking like Preach
Open cases on me for a half a million each
I find peace knowing that its harder in the streets
I know luckily I didnt have to grow there
I would only go there cause theres niggas that I know there
I dont know whats getting into me
I just like the rush when you see your enemy somewhere in the club
And you realize he just not in a position to reciprocate your energy
You aint ever worried cause hes not who he pretends to be
People like Mazin who was a best friend to me
Start to become a distant memory
Things change in that life and this life started lacking synergy
And fucking with me mentally I think its meant to be
Paranoid always rolling with my mothafuckin boys
But you gotta understand when its yours
They dont really leave your ass with a mothafuckin choice man
I just love when Im with you yeah this shit is on ten
We used to be friends girl and even back then
You would look at me with no hesitation and youd tell me baby its yours
Nobody elses yeah this shit belong to nobody its yours
Nobody elses yeah this shit belong to nobody and that
What made me think about the game girl
And how I switched it up with a new thang
Young nigga came through on his Wu-Tang
And nowadays when I ask about who got it they say its yours
Nobody elses yeah this shit belong to nobody its yours
Nobody elses yeah this shit belong to nobody its yours
Its yours thats for sureYou must remember wakin up in Paris with the blunt
You must remember fuckin me like anytime you want
What made us wanna act like we were married for two weeks
Now we back in California we dont even speak
Thats a no no
Everyone said we look good on paper
You deserve that action
Plus you get more paper than I do that shit attractive
Things that make me miss you with Jen and Melissa
Say Hi M
Tell the squad I said what up girl
Look at me look at me look at I
Ballin out swear I use to be shy
Young nigga
Back when I was tryna make a MI
My nigga when can I
How is this shit goin how it is
I always seem to kill it and yet everybody lives
I hope that they remember me for everything I did
Its some views from the six
Just some views from the sixYeah
All you self promoters are janky
We established like the Yankees
This whole fucking game thank us
We movin militant but somehow you the one tankin
No limit to where I can take it
And you know me as a Cris bottle sender
Check pick upper
I thought we looked out for one another
Saw us all as brothers in the struggle
Too blessed to be humble
I guess its different in the city I come from
All the sudden I got people showing how much they truly resent me
They whole demeanor just spells envy
They tryna tempt me
The higher I get the less they accept me
Even had the OGs tryna press me
Ha-ha-ha-ha
No way out cause Im already in it
Im not attending when I do a show and get a ticket
Good business can clean millions I got the vision
I been had it since No Scrubs and No Pigeons
Even back when I wasnt as poppin
When they told me take an RB nigga on the road and I told em no and drew for Kendrick and Rocky
I tried to make the right choices with the world watching
Mike never tried to rap like Pac
Pac never tried to sing like Mike
Those my dads words to me when I asked him how to make it in life
And I always said my mother gave the greatest advice
Yeah look at me now they look at me like the golden child
Cant nobody hold me down especially not right now
Certain shit is just too wild to reconcile
Take that take that no love in they heart so they fake that
DiCaprio level the way they play that damn nigga what is that
Yall dont hear no songs then hit my phone like you did that
And you even hit my line like where you been at
Its always on some shit like when can I get a favor
Or where my bitch at like Im about to tell you where she been at
Costa Careyes I got her kidnapped
She aint sorry and I aint sorry its too late for sorry
Green White and Red on my body cause Im dipped in Ferrari
All she wanna do is get high and listen to PARTY
She complain I tell the driver to drop her at Barneys
My summer diet is just RosÃ and calamari
Look now you got me started
Im the black sheep rest in peace to Chris Farley
I got a lot to lose cause in every situation
Im the bigger artist always gotta play it smarter
Yall shook up Im here on the cookup
Cameras pointing every time I look up
Thats why I gotta duck behind Chubb shoulder just to hit the Kush up
Sponsorship dollars is sky high
He be like Drake will you please stop smoking la la
Chubbs why try Im a thug Imma die high
Got the Rose pink tinted lenses its a Wednesday
Architects takin dimensions they redoin the entrance
Yeah redoin the entrance
Kinda like when you niggas drop on some again and again shit
And you still never quite get it
Meantime Drizzy over there tryna make you

Sunshinin waxed tires
See Kris Jenner I beep twice and I wave
The rest of you boys I blow Keysh right in your face
Pistol by my bed Im sleep but Im awake
For that one night you niggas try to reach inside my safe
Dont push me cause Im way too uneasy nowadays
These guys move so greasy nowadays

We mustve been here before its still fresh on my mind
You got that shit that somebody would look for but wont find
You mustve done this before this cant be your first time
Shower her with dollar tips
Shawty went and bought a whip
Guarantee the city remember your whole name
You throw the ho a scholarship
All of them aint all equipped
And this saddens me I see the pecking order
Quote-unquote bad bitches work the whole floor
Those that get laughed at sit off in the corner
Like a lab rat nobody want her
Niggas that are married dont wanna go home
But we look up to them they wish they were us
They want some new trim
We lust for some trust
Now the both of us are colourblind
Cause the other side looks greener
Which leaves your turf in the Boise state
Cant see her play or the team cuz
Everybody has an addiction mine happens to be you
And those who say they dont
Souls will later on say to them that aint true
All of them will have an opinion
But yall know what you can do with them
But if you unsure Ill take you on tour
To a place you can stick that in
Well sitting here sad as hell
Listening to Adele I feel you baby
Someone like you more like someone unlike you
Or someone thats familiar maybe
And I can tell that she wants a baby
And I can yell Girl that shit crazy
Oh what the hell Nope cant be lazy
Please be careful bitches got the rabiesIntro - Drake

But get it while you here boy

Tripping off you because you had your shot
With my skin tanned and my hair long
And my fans who been so patient me and forty back to work but we still smell like a vacation
Hate the rumors hate the bullshit hate these fucking allegations
Im just feeling like the throne is for the taking
Watch me take it
All I care about is money and the city that Im from

Two white cups and I got that drink

Depending on how you mix that shit
Money that we got never get that shit
Because Im on one
I said fuck it Im on one
Im burning purple flowers
Its burning my chest
I bury the most cash and burning the rest
Walking on the clouds suspended in thin air
Do ones beneath me recognize the Red Bottoms I wear
Burner in the belt
Move the kids to the hills
Bend shawty on the sink do it for the thrill
Kiss you on your neck and tell you everything is great
Even though Im out on bond I might be facing eight
Still running with the same niggas till the death of me
Ever seen a million cash Got to count it carefully
Ever made love to the woman of your dreams
In a room full of money out in London and she screams
Baby I could take it there
Call Marc Jacobs personally to make a pair

Just mail me my ring back cant keep that shit laughsAll we wanted was opportunity
Just Blaze Lord Knows
Its your worst nightmare its my first night here
And this girl right here who knows what she knows
So Im going through her phone if she go to the bathroom
And her purse right there I dont trust these hoes at all
But thats just the result of me paying attention
To all these women that think like men with the same intentions
Talking strippers and models that try to gain attention
Even a couple porn stars that Im ashamed to mention
But Weezy and Stunna are my only role models
Heffer and Jordan my only role models
Thats why I walk around with all this gold on
And every time I run into these ns they want no problems
Bottom sixes and chains and some bracelets and rings
All of the little accents that make me a king
I never hear the disses they try and point out to me
But its whatever if somebody wan make it a thing
Im more concerned what ns thinkin about Christmas in August
Do anything to buy gifts for they daughters
Get some shake a brick in the press
And chef it like Mrs Fields theyre making the cookie stretch
I know it so well I know the hustle so well
Stunt like Im workin overnighters right by the motel
Drug money outfit record clean
Spend it all on me and my fin team
Matchin Rollies for real matchin Rovers for real
Places they say theyve been weve actually going for real
Im really killin s f all the jiggy rappin
Im going trigga happy just to see my ns happy
Mixtape legend underground kings
Lookin for the right way to do the wrong things
With my new b thats living in Palm Springs
Young a n lifelong dreams
They take the greats from the past and compare us
I wonder if theyd ever survive in this era
In a time where its recreation
To pull all your skeletons out the closet like Halloween decorations
I know of all the things that I hear they be pokin fun at
Never the flow though they know I run that
F you all I claim that whenever
I change rap forever the game back together yup
YM I remain that forever
In the same place my brother Wayne at forever
Im a descendent of either Marley or Hendrix
I havent figured it out cause my story is far from finished
Im hearing all of the jokes I know that they tryna push me
I know that showin emotion dont ever mean Im a p
Know that I dont make music for ns who dont get p
So those are the ones I count on to diss me or overlook me
Lord knows Lord knows Im heavy I got my weight up
Roberson boost the rate up its time that somebody paid up
A lot of ns came up off of a style that I made up
But if all I hear is me then who should I be afraid of
Bought a white Ghost now s is gettin spooky
Very very scary like s you see in the movies
In this b all drinks on the house like Snoopy
Thats why all the real soldiers salute me
Trill n for real
You know I love this
Yolo You Only Live Once
Im going so hard my n I swear homie
Everyday is another opportunity to reach that goal
I fell in love with the pen started fing in ink
The hustles an art I paint it what I would think
Still allergic to broke prescription straight to the paper
Destined for greatness but got a place in Jamaica
Villa on the water with the wonderful views
Only fat n in the sauna with Jews
Went and got a yacht Im talkin Carnival cruise
And these ns talkin like hoes they mad they not in my shoes
Its the red bottom boss came to buy the bar
Every by week s Im bound to buy a car
Murder-cedes Benz of that bubble double R
Headlights flickin lookin like a fallin star
Everyday them hammers bang whippin ye like anime

And really I think I like who Im becoming
Theres times where I might do it just to do it like its nothing
Theres times when I might blow like fifty k on a vacation

But you believe in everything but me girl I dont get you
She says I know you changed I never see you
Cause youre always busy doing things
I really wish she had a different way of viewing things
I think the city that were from just kinda ruined things

The men are jealous and the women all in competition
And now your friends telling you stories that you often misinterpret
And taint all the images of your Mr Perfect

Praying for your happiness hope that you recover
This is one I know you hated when you heard it

Take a shot for me ooh

Take a shot for me
A shot for me
A shot for meAll my exes live in Texas like Im George Strait
Or they go to Georgia State where
Tuition is handled by some random nigga that live in Atlanta
That she only see when she feels obligated
Admitted it to me the first time we dated
But she was no angel and we never waited
I took her for sushi she wanted to fuck
So we took it to go told them dont even plate it
And we never talk too much after I blew up
Just only hello or happy belated
And I think I text her and told her I made it
And thats when she text me and told me she prayed it
And thats when I text her and told her I love it
And right after texting told her Im faded
She asked
What have I learned since getting richer
I learned working with the negatives could make for better pictures
I learned Hennessey and enemies is one hell of a mixture
Even though its fucked up girl Im still fucking wit ya
Damn is it the fall
Time for me to revisit the past
Its women to call
Theres albums to drop theres liquor involved
Theres stories to tell we been through it all
Interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my dressing room confusing me with questions
Like
Do you love this shit
Are you high right now
Do you ever get nervous
Are you single
I heard you fucked your girl is it true
You getting money You think them niggas you with is wit you

So much for being optimistic
They say love is in the air so I
Hold my breath until my face turn purple
Keep a few bad bitches in my circle
My nuts hang like aint no curfew
Bitch if you wave then I will surf you
I flew jet she flew commercial
But we still met later that night
After my session she came over
I was aggressive and she was sober
I gave her pills
She started confessing and started undressing
And ask me to hold her
And so I did but that was last month
And now shes texting me asking for closure
Damn
She say this shit gon catch up to me
I keep tissue paper
We eat each other whenever we at the dinner table
She say she hate that she love me
And she wish I was average
Shit sometimes I wish the same
And I wish she wasnt married
Promises I hope I never break em
Met a female dragon had a fire conversation but
Interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my bedroom confusing me with questions like

Cant even steer straight I cant even steer straight
Oh fuck with me I buy the shots
Live a little cause niggas die a lot and lie a lot
But Im the truth thats right I fucking said it
The living proof that you aint gotta die to get to heaven
You girl you right there you look like you like this shit
Howd I know howd I know Thats me on some psychic shit
I can tell a lie if you ask me about my whereabouts
But I might talk that real if you ask me what I care about
Reppin bitches reppin bitches bitches
And reppin reppin them bitches until all of us switches
I swear its been two years since somebody ask me who I was
Im the greatest man I said that before I knew I was
Thats whats important and what really happened before this
When me and my crew was all about this rapper from New Orleans
Singing walking like a man finger on the trigger
I got money in my pocket Im a uptown nigga ah
With fame on my mind my girl on my nerves
I was pushing myself to get something that I deserve
That was back in the days Acura days
I was a cold dude Im getting back to my ways
People always ask how I got my nice things
Take my crown to the grave Im an underground king
I bet we can make tonight the greatest story ever told
Cause Im down to spend whatever lately Ive been on a roll
And I do it for the city cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city cause you know the city love it a nigga
Do it for the city cause you know the city love it a nigga
Do it for the city UGK fuck these other niggas
Sometimes I need that romance sometimes I need that pole dance
Sometimes I need that stripper thats gon tell me that she dont dance
Tell me lies make it sound good make it sound good
Do me like the women from my town would
Leather with that woodgrain Persian rugs on wood floors
Talking all them good things thats all Im really good for
Memphis Tennessee no see I start to go deep back
And rich crust with my seat back with Yo Gotti and E-Mack
And these niggas got them diamonds glowing in they mouth
And they rockin furs like its snowing in the south
And every pretty girl tell me thats the shit that she like
So why am I a classic this is who Im trying to be like
So I drop out lessons I was taught are quick to fade
As soon I realize that term-end papers they wont get me paid
If I dont nothing Ima ball
Im countin all day like a clock on the wall
Yeah need that making major changes to the life Im living
I had no choice I had to prove I made the right decisions
That was back in the days Acura days
I was a cold dude Im getting back to my ways
People always ask how I got my nice things
Take my crown to the grave Im an underground king
I bet we can make tonight the greatest story ever told
Cause Im down to spend whatever lately Ive been on a roll
And I do it for the city cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city cause you know the city love it a nigga
Do it for the city cause you know the city love it a nigga
Do it for the city UGK fuck these other niggasGood God Almighty like back in the old days
You know years ago they had the AR men to tell you what to play
How to play it and you know whether its disco and rock
But um we just went in the studio and we did it
We had champagne in the studio of course you know
Compliments of the company and we just laid back and did it
So we hope you enjoy listening to this album half as much
As we enjoyed playing it for you because we had a ball
Only real music is gonna last
All the other bullshit is here today and gone tomorrow
Cash rules everything around me
CREAM get the money dolla-dolla bill yall
After hours of Il Mulino
Or Sotto Sotto just talkin about women and vino
The contract like ninety-one Dan Marino
I swear this got Michael Rapino boostin my ego
Overly focused its far from the time to rest now
Debates growing bout who they think is the best now
Took a while got the jokers out of the deck now
Im holdin all the cards and niggas wanna play chess now
I hear you talkin say it twice so I know you meant it
Fuck it I dont even tint it they should know whos in it
Im authentic real name no gimmicks
No game no scrimmage I aint playin with you niggas at all
My classmates they went on to be chartered accountants
Or work with their parents but thinkin back on how they treated me
My high school reunion might be worth an appearance
Make everybody have to go through security clearance
Tables turn bridges burn you live and learn
With the ink I could murder word to my nigga Irv
Yeah I swear shit just started clickin dog
You know its real when you are who you think you are
Cash rules everything around me
CREAM get the money dolla-dolla bill yall
Cash rules everything around me
CREAM get the money dolla-dolla bill yall
Uh I had Benzes fore you had braces
The all black Maybach but Im not a racist
Insides whiter than Katy Perrys face is
Yellow diamonds in my JesÃºs
I just might learn to speak Mandarin
Japanese for the yen that Im handlin
International Hov thats my handle
My saints Sean Don light a candle
El Gran Santo on the mantle
Case yall didnt know I speak Spanish too
Shoutout to Worldwide Wes
Everywhere we go we leave a worldwide mess
Yes still Roc La Familia
Says a lot about you if you not feelin us
The homie said Hov there aint many of us
I told him less is more nigga its plenty of us
Cash rules everything around me
CREAM get the money dolla-dolla bill yall
Cake cake-cake cake-cake cake
five hundred million I got a pound cake
Niggas is frontin thats upside-down cake

Cake cake-cake cake-cake
Uh Im just gettin started oh yeah we got it bitch
Ive done made more millionaires than the lotto did
Dame made millions Bigg made millions
Ye made millions Just made millions
Lyor made millions Cam made millions
Beans tell you if he wasnt in his feelings

My eyes bloodshot but my jet dont lag
A pair of Jordan threes tryna chase this cash
Gucci air bag just in case we crash
Uh last night was mad trill
Im fresh out of Advil Jesus grab the wheel
Yeah uh look fuck all that happy to be here shit that yall want me on
Im the big homie they still be tryna lil bro me dog
Like I should fall in line like I should alert niggas
When Im bout to drop somethin crazy and I say Im the greatest of my generation
Like I should be dressin different
Like I should be less aggressive and pessimistic
Like I should be way more nervous and less dismissive
Like I should be on my best behavior
And not talk my shit and do it major like the niggas who paved the way for us
Like I didnt study the game to the letter
And understand that Im not doin it the same man Im doin it better
Like I didnt make that clearer this year
Like I should feel I dont know guilty for saying that
They should put a couple more mirrors in here so I can stare at myself
These are usually just some thoughts that I would share with myself
But I thought Fuck it
Its worth it to share em with someone else more than Paris for once
I text her from time to time she a mom now
I guess sometimes life forces us to calm down
I told her she could live with me if she need to
I got a compound but I think shes straight
Cause she supported since Hot Beats right before Wayne came
And got me out of the backroom where I was rapping with Jas over beats I shouldnt have in the hopes for the glory
He walked right past in the hallway three months later Im his artist
He probably wouldnt remember that story
But that shit stick with me
Always couldnt believe when he called me
You never know it could happen to you
And I just spent four Ferraris all on a brand new Bugatti
And did that shit cause its something to do yeah
I guess its just who I became dog
Nothing was the same dogWe both wake up staring at the sky
Dont remember how we got here but we dont wonder why
Right now we living life like theres no way we can die
But we bout to do our thing they couldnt stop us if they try
Keep the weapon for the haters if they try to blow our high
How the fuck would they stop us if we by each others side
We were meant to be together we get inside
How the hell would they kill us when were feeling so alive
Ooh girl I know you want a G
Its kinda hard not to notice me
Cause Im right here where you wanna be
I can take you where you wanna go oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Baby I can give what you want and everything you need
Put us both in a position where we can both succeed
And if it takes a sacrifice I promise I will bleed
All the blessings that I get I promise youll receive
fuck them other niggas all they do is deceive
Let me take away your pain my job is to relieve
Ooh girl I know you want a G
Its kinda hard not to notice me
Cause Im right here where you wanna be
I can take you where you wanna go oh oh oh oh oh oh oh ohI can see it in your eyes youre angry
Regret got shit on what youre feeling now
Mad cause he aint like me
Oh you mad cause nobody ever did it like me
All the care I would take all the love that we made
Now youre trying to find somebody to replace what I gave to you
Its a shame you didnt keep it Alicia Katia
I know that you gon hear this Im the man
Yeah I said it bitch Im the man
Dont you forget it
The way you walk thats me
The way you talk thats me
The way youve got your hair up did you forget thats me
And the voice in your speaker right now thats me
And the voice in your ear thats me
Cant you see that I made it Yeah I made it
First I made you who you are then I made it
And youre wasted with your ladies
Yeah Im the reason why you always getting faded
Chorus
Take a shot for me ooh
Take a shot for me ooh
Take a shot for me
A shot for me
A shot for me
Okay look Im honest
Girl I cant lie I miss you
You and the music were the only things that I commit to
I never cheated for the record back when I was with you
But you believe in everything but me girl I dont get you
She says I know you changed I never see you
Cause youre always busy doing things
I really wish she had a different way of viewing things
I think the city that were from just kinda ruined things
Its such a small place not much to do but talk and listen
The men are jealous and the women all in competition
And now your friends telling you stories that you often misinterpret
And taint all the images of your Mr Perfect
I could tell that you been crying all night drinking all summer
Praying for your happiness hope that you recover
This is one I know you hated when you heard it
And its worse because you know that I deserve it
ChorusYou know you know
How the story go
You just jumped my style
You just stole my flow
You just seen me out
You gets no hello
And you wonder why
Man you know you know
Yeah and you should let them boys know too
Show them niggas every single thing I showed you
Im here feeling like fifty back in two
And everybody saying Im the man
So true
Yeah but what does it take to feel secure
A place with wooden floors
A space to put awards
A couple of parking spots
And maids to do the chores
The cars you always wanted
And women that you adore
Well I got it I got it
I wonder if Id be happy without it
I doubt it
I try not to really think about it
I made it but Im still playing like Im being scouted till Im out it
Game time bitch
I hope your proud of us
King James shit
Watch me throw the powder up
This old G got my whole suite clouded up
And I bet you I be outta time before Im outta luck
They aint rooting for me
They aint clapping for me
Im only saying iwhy cant someone be happy for me
I really hate to say I told you so
So I bite my tongue
But you know you know
This is hard right
Please make your long story shorter
Cos time is at the essence for the king of first quarter
Numbers do the talking
I have nothing for reporters
I just hope we get these flights and dont get held up at the border
Yeah so you can spare me all the alcalays
Im the real reason you can find my city on an atlas page
Half a million dollars later and my tax is paid
And Im still spitting money from my active days
Damn life is such a lovely thing
Feel the perks that a seven digit budget bring
Tell your girlfriend that I could pull some fucking strings
So at courtside when Im wrong get a fucking ring
Yeah I bet Ill be there Ill be there
You see that sixty-two sitting outside
Thats me there
Im jumping to the time thats my leap year
Prepare
Putting in that overtime
I never said itd be fair
Im always left wishing that I could of done it in person
My apologies to all of the ones I was hurting
I got new girls but none of their love is for certain
I call old girls but none of their numbers are working
Damn what happened to us
Life can always change
You have to adjust
How come when I gotta carter you stare at me in disgust
I say its just to have fun
You should see that as a plus
Especially when I come flying through the door
I cant ignore
The paparazzi outside trying to record
Whys every woman never down here before
Am I the only twenty-three year old why cant I soar
The rough child the crews the guy thats in the open seats
Its always nice when your out with someone who notices
A condo got that art gallery openings
Im just hoping that isnt what my hoping is
They aint rooting for me
They aint clapping for me
Im only saying why cant someone just be happy for me
I really hate to say I told you so
So I bite my tongue
But you know you knowI know youve been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me heres what Ill do
Ill take care of you
Ive loved and Ive lost
Ive asked about you and theyve told me things
But my mind didnt change
I still the feel the same
Whats a life with no fun please dont be so ashamed
Ive had mine youve had yours we both know
We know they dont get you like I will
My only wish is I die real
Cause that truth hurts and those lies heal
And you cant sleep thinking that he lies still
So you cry still tears all in the pillow case
Big girls all get a little taste
Pushing me away so I give her space
Dealing with a heart that I didnt break
Ill be there for you I will care for you
I keep thanking you just dont know
Trying to run from that say youre done with that
On your face girl it just dont show
When youre ready just say youre ready
When all the baggage just aint as heavy
And the parties over just dont forget me
Well change the pace and well just go slow
You wont ever have to worry
You wont ever have to hide
And you seen all my mistakes
So look me in my eyes
Cause if you let me heres what Ill do
Ill take care of you
Ive loved and Ive lost
Its my birthday I get high if I want to
Cant deny that I want you but I lie if have to
Cause you dont say you love me
To your friends when they ask you
Even though we both know that you do you do
One time been in love one time
You and all your girls in the club one time
All so convinced that youre following your heart
Cause your mind dont control what it does sometimes
We all have our nights though dont be so ashamed
Ive had mine youve had yours we both know
We know
You hate being alone you aint the only one
You hate the fact that you bought the dream
And they sold you one
You love your friends but somebody shoulda told you somin to save you
Instead they sayCups of the Rose
Bitches in my old phone
I should call one and go home
Ive been in this club too long
The woman that I would try
Is happy with a good guy
But Ive been drinking so much
That Ima call her anyway and say
F-ck that nigga that you love so bad
I know you still think about the times we had
I say f-ck that nigga that you think you found
And since you picked up I know hes not around
Are you drunk right now
Im just sayin you could do better
Tell me have you heard that lately
Im just sayin you could do better
And Ill start hatin only if you make me
Uh cups of the XO

Guess she dont have the time to kick it no more
Flights in the morning
What you doing thats so important
Ive been drinking so much
That Ima call you anyway and say
F-ck that nigga that you love so bad
I know you still think about the times we had
I say f-ck that nigga that you think you found
And since you picked up I know hes not around
Are you drunk right now
Im just sayin you could do better
Tell me have you heard that lately
Im just sayin you could do better
And Ill start hatin only if you make me
I think Im addicted to naked pictures
And sittin talkin bout bitches

I dont think Im concious of making monsters
Outta the women that I sponsor til it all goes bad
But shit its all good
We threw a party yeh we threw a party
Bitches came over yeh we threw a party
I was just calling cause they were just leaving
Talk to me please dont have much to believe in
I need you right now are you down to listen to me
Too many drinks have been given to me
I got some women thats living off me
Paid for their flights and hotels Im ashamed
Bet that you know them I wont say no names
After a while girl they all seem the same
Ive had sex four times this week Ill explain
Having a hard time adjusting to fame
Sprite in that mixture Ive been talking crazy girl
Im lucky that you picked up
Lucky that you stayed on
I need someone to put this weight on
Drake and Woman on phone
Well Im sorry -- Drake
Are you drunk right now -- Woman
Im just sayin you could do better
Tell me have you heard that lately
Im just sayin you could do better
And Ill start hatin only if you make me
Drake on phone

Show lessI hate when people say they feel me man I hate that s
Itll be a long time before yall feel me if ever
You wont feel me until everybody
Say they love you but its not love
And your suit is oxblood
And the girl you fing hates you
And your friends faded off shots of
What you ordered
Then forget about the game that you on top of
Your famous girlfriend a keep getting
Thicker than the plot does
And when you forget her thats when she pop up
And you got a drop but you ride around with the top up
Or get three SUVs for ns dressed like refugees
And deal with the questions
About all your excessive needs
And you do dinners at French Laundry in Napa Valley
Scallops and glaes of Dolce
That s right up your alley
You see a girl and you ask about her
Bes smiling at you it must be happy hour
They put the cloth across your lap soon as you sat down
Its feeling like you own every place you choose to be at now
Walking through airport security with your hat down
Instead of getting a pat down they just keep on
Saying that they feel you n
Yeah
Its been too long
Been way too long
Ive been faded too long
Ive been faded too long
Ive been faded too long
Why wont it start The ride
Why wont it start The ride
You wont feel me til you want it so bad you tell yourself youre in it
And tell the world around you that your paper work is finished
And steal your mothers debit cards so you maintain an image
And ride around in overpriced rental cars that aint tinted
You need a minute you got it
You know its real when your latest nights are your greatest nights
The sun is up when you get home thats just a way of life
Apartment fifteen o three some couches and paintings
When you record with two others that want the same things
Yeah it start to feel better than home feels
And so you up there every night you swear you getting close
That champagne money was for gas and phone bills
But s you bout to spend it on what matters most
You drop a couple songs and hopes that you can beat a n
And come out every night to let the city see the n
Telling stories that nobody relate to
And even though they hate you they just keep on telling you they feel ya n
Ive been faded too long
Ive been faded too long
Ive been faded too long
Why wont it start The ride
Why wont it start The ride
I havent been inside terminal one and three in so long
Im driving right up to it now make sure you got your coat on
That runway can be cold especially after summers rolled on
And all you knew is alcohol and city lights and slow songs
For four months out the year its got you asking whats good at home
Whats good at home
The same hoes are still at it I shoulda known
My young ns poppin Ms and sippin dirty jones
Problem children that all be reppin Octobers Own
Brand new girl and she still growing
Brand new titties stitches still showing
Yeah and she just praying that it heals good
Im bout to f and Im just praying that it feels good
I really dont know much but s I know a secret
They say more money more problems my n dont believe it
I mean sure theres some bills and taxes Im still evading
But I blew six million on my self and I feel amazing
Young money maker season ticket holder
Season switching over
I come through them bes still scorching as if I didnt notice
You ns gettin older I see no threat in Yoda
Im out here messing over the lives of these ns
That couldnt f with my freshman flow
Look at that fing chip on your nephews shoulder
My sophomore I was all for it they all saw it
My Junior and senior will only get meaner
Take care n
Im still faded faded faded faded the ride
Why wont it start the ride
Why wont it start the ride
Why wont it start ooh the rideHow Im feeling it doesnt matter
Cause you know Im okay
Instead I ask myself why do you hurt me
When you know you know Im the same
I know I know that you love me baby
Theyre trying to take you away from me
Only over my dead body
I think I killed everybody in the game last year man fuck it I was on though
And I thought I found the girl of my dreams at a strip club mm
Fuck it I was wrong though
Shout out all to all my niggas living tax free
Nowadays its six figures when they tax me
Oh well I guess you lose some and win some
Long as the outcome is income
You know I want it all and then some
Shout out to Asian girls let the lights dim sum
Shots came I dont know where they was sent from
Probably some bad hoes about to take the hemp from
Yeah you know me well nigga
Yeah I mean you aint the only real nigga
They got me on these white women like Seal nigga
Slave to the pussy but Im just playing the field nigga yeah
Are these people really discussing my career again
Asking if Ill be going platinum in a year again
Dont I got the shit the world wanna hear again
Dont Michael Jordan still got his hoop earing in
Man all of your flows bore me paint drying
And I dont ever be trippin off of what aint mine
And I be hearing the shit you say through the grapevine
But jealousy is just love and hate at the same time
Its been that way from the beginning
I just been playing I aint even know that I was winning
And this is the only sound you should fear
Man these kids wear crowns over here and everything is alright
I know I know that you love me baby
Theyre trying to take you away from me
Only over my dead body
You say Im old news well who the new star
Cause if Im going anywhere its probably too far
Just performed at a Bar Mitzvah over in the States
Used half of the money to beat my brothers case
Red wine over Fed time
But shout out to the niggas thats doing dead time
And shout out to the bitches there when its bedtime
And fuck you to the niggas that think its their time
Yeah dont make me take your life apart boy
You and whoever the fuck gave you your start boy
Or you wanna be a muthafuckin funny guy
Dont make me break your Kevin heart boy
Yeah its whatever You know feeling good living better
I think maybe I was numb to it last year
But you know I feel it now more than ever
My city love me like Mac Dre in the Bay
Second album Im back paving the way
The backpackers are back on the bandwagon
Like this was my comeback season back back in the day
And I met your baby moms last night
We took a picture together I hope she frames it
And I was drinking at the Palms last night
And ended up losing everything that I came with
Feel like Ive been here before huh
I still got ten years to go huh
And this is the only sound you should fear
These kids wear crowns over here
And everything is all rightAll my exes live in Texas like Im George Strait
Or they go to Georgia State where
Tuition is handled by some random nigga that live in Atlanta
That she only see when she feels obligated
Admitted it to me the first time we dated
But she was no angel and we never waited
I took her for sushi she wanted to fuck
So we took it to go told them dont even plate it
And we never talk too much after I blew up
Just only hello or happy belated
And I think I text her and told her I made it
And thats when she text me and told me she prayed it
And thats when I text her and told her I love it
And right after texting told her Im faded
She asked
What have I learned since getting richer
I learned working with the negatives could make for better pictures
I learned Hennessey and enemies is one hell of a mixture
Even though its fucked up girl Im still fucking wit ya
Damn is it the fall
Time for me to revisit the past
Its women to call
Theres albums to drop theres liquor involved
Theres stories to tell we been through it all
Interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my dressing room confusing me with questions
Like
Do you love this shit
Are you high right now
Do you ever get nervous
Are you single
I heard you fucked your girl is it true
You getting money You think them niggas you with is wit you

Hold my breath until my face turn purple
Keep a few bad bitches in my circle
My nuts hang like aint no curfew
Bitch if you wave then I will surf you
I flew jet she flew commercial
But we still met later that night
After my session she came over
I was aggressive and she was sober
I gave her pills
She started confessing and started undressing
And ask me to hold her
And so I did but that was last month
And now shes texting me asking for closure
Damn
She say this shit gon catch up to me
I keep tissue paper
We eat each other whenever we at the dinner table
She say she hate that she love me
And she wish I was average
Shit sometimes I wish the same
And I wish she wasnt married
Promises I hope I never break em
Met a female dragon had a fire conversation but

Aw YeahVerse Drake
All I care about is money and the city that Im from
Imma sip until I feel it Imma smoke it til its done
And I dont really give a fuck and my excuse is that Im young
And Im only getting older somebody shoulda told you
Im on one fuck it Im on one
I said Im on one fuck it Im on one a strong one
Two white cups and I got that drink
It could be purple it could be pink
Depending on how you mix that shit
Money to be got and Imma get that shit
Cause Im on one I said fuck it Im on one
All she cares about is money
And the city where shes from
Her intention is the paper
She dont need no fucking love
She spilling all this liquor
Trying to pass me all these cups
Well baby girl Im zoning
Somebody shouldve told her
I popped one
Fuck it I popped one
Oh girl Im on one
I popped one
Girl Im lying Im on a few
Dont you worry this aint new
Can we take this to your spot
Im on eviction number two
Cause I popped one
Fuck it cause I popped one
You know what Im sipping Ill teach you how to mix it
But youre the only one cause I dont trust these bitches
I dont trust these bitches they might catch me slipping
So youre the only one cause I dont trust these bitches
They might catch me slipping and put in something different
So youre the only one cause I dont trust these bitches
I dont trust these bitches they might catch me slipping
So youre the only one
Oh
Do you know whats going on over here
I do I do I do
Have you even bothered to look
I did I did I did
Well if you know then let me know
We dont gotta be running in these circles in these circles
No more
Break
Trust issues 
Drizzy Drake check me out
Coming live from the mothafucking North Side
Kick game run game run it real good
But never ever have my bitches sitting court side
Same nigga that you knew way back when
You acting like its somebody you dont know
Tell me how the fuck we supposed to stay friends
When you got a bunch of feelings that you dont show
I could tell I could tell I could tell
Certain people dont like me no more
New shit dont excite me no more
Guess that they dont really make them like me no more
You can look me in my eyes and see I aint myself
Cause if yall what I created then I hate myself
But still let them girls in and tell em all
Leave their cell phones on the table where we see them
Im all day with it man AM to the PM
Niggas hating I just wish that they would say it when they see him
Thats that shit that drives me crazy
And thats all Ive been getting lately
And its probably why Im scared to put the time in
Women want to fuck like theyre me and Im them
Looking for some things and I think that I can find them in you in you
Woah trust issues Its like o nine in your basement and Im in love with Nebby
And I still love her but it fell through because I wasnt ready
And your back hurt and your neck hurt and you smoking heavy
And I sit next to you and I lecture you because those are deadly
And then you ask shit and we argue about spending money on bullshit
And you tell me Im just like my father my one button you push it
Now its Fuck you I hate you Ill move out in a heartbeat
And I leave out and you call me you tell me that youre sorry
You love me and I love you and your heart hurts mine does too
And its just words and they cut deep but its our world its just us two
I see painkillers on the kitchen counter I hate to see it all hurt so bad
But maybe I wouldnt have worked this hard
If you were healthy and it werent so bad
Uh maybe I should walk up the street and try and get a job at the bank
Cause leave it up to me J and neeks were probably gonna end up robbing a bank
Then Wayne calls on my phone conversation wasnt that long
Gets me a flight to Houston in the morning
Oh its my time yeah its on
Hes thinking of signing me I come home
We make a mixtape with seventeen songs
And almost get a Grammy off of that thing
They love your son and that boy gone
You get the operation you dreamed of
And I finally send you to Rome
I get to make good on my promise
It all worked out girl we shoulda known
Cause you deserve it
This shit real should I pinch you
After all the things that we been through I got you
Look what youve done look what youve done
Look what youve done for me now
You knew that I was gonna be something
We stressed out and you need some I got you
Look what youve done look what youve done
Its like o six in your backyard and Im in love with Jade
And Im still in love just when its that real is when it doesnt fade
And my father living in Memphis now he cant come this way
Over some minor charges and child support that just wasnt paid
Damn boo-hoo sad story black American dad story
Know that Im your sisters kid but
That still dont explain the love that you have for me
I remember sneaking in your pool after school dances
Damn your house feel like the Hamptons
For all of my summer romances
I never really had no one like you man this all new she
Made the world I knew bigger changed the way that I viewed it
Had all this fighting going on at the crib
You would calm me down when I lose it
Told you I think Im done acting Im more in touch with the music
You said either way Ill be a star I could go so far
Talked to me to you got to me you
You tossed the keys and loaned me your car
Yeah just a young kid in a drop top
Lexus hopin that I dont get arrested
Just another kid thats goin through life
So worried that I wont be accepted
But I could do anything you said that and you meant that
You took me places you spent that they said no we went back
Checks bounce but we bounce back
I put all the money in your accounts back
And I thank you I dont where Id really be without that
It worked out man you deserve it
This shit real should I pinch you
After all the things that we been through I got you
Look what youve done look what youve done
Look what youve done for me now
You knew that I was gonna be something
We stressed out and you need some I got you
Look what youve done look what youve doneWhen a good thing goes bad its not the end of the world
Its just the end of a world that you had with one girl
And shes the reason it happened but shes overreacting
And its all because she dont want things to change
So cry if you need to but I cant stay to watch you
Thats the wrong thing to do
Touch if you need to but I cant stay to hold you
Thats the wrong thing to do
Talk if you need to but I cant stay to hear you
Thats the wrong thing to do
Cause youll say you love me and Ill end up lying
And say I love you too
But I need someone different
You know it oh ho you know it
Oh ho you know it we both know it
I need someone different
You know it oh ho you know it
Oh ho you know it we both know it
Somethings been missing
You know it oh ho she knows it
Oh ho I know it we all know it
I need someone different oh ho oh ho
We live in a generation of not being in love and not being together
But we sure make it feel like were together
Cause were scared to see each other with somebody else
So cry if you need to but I cant stay to watch you
Thats the wrong thing to do
Touch if you need to but I cant stay to hold you
Thats the wrong thing to do
Talk if you need to but I cant stay to hear you
Thats the wrong thing to do
Cause youll say you love me and Ill end up lying
And say I love you too
But I need someone different
You know it oh ho you know it
Oh ho you know it we both know it
I need someone different
You know it oh ho you know it
Oh ho you know it we both know it
Somethings been missing
You know it oh ho she knows it
Oh ho I know it we all know it
I need someone different Oh ho oh hoDrake Talking
I dont even need a note pad for this one right here man
Shut the lights off
Let the mind work ya know
I like to uh
I like to take the time to dedicate this to a special somebody
Guess Ill call her one of my most recent addition to my collection of female disappointments you know
Deceiving you are the reason that
I dont believe in finding the love that I need and
Im Uncle Phil I switch wifey like every season
So I guess that makes u Ant Viv
Until u take from me till the point that u cant give
And when I see u out I pass by its offensive
But what u expect tho
Kinda direct yo
Cuhz all that Dolce and Gabana shit was expensive
I told ya
Mr Edwards I tried to save your daughter
But she wasnt satisfied with none of the things that I bought her
And wasnt tryna show up none of the places that I brought her
And couldnt utilize none of the things that I taught her
So I was just tryna upgrade you
I aint ya understudy that tryna upstage you
I was ya other buddy that tried to front page you
Crown you
Get to know the people that surround you
Funny to think that I woulda white gowned you
Cuz Now we sit around the studio and clown you
Oops did I let that slip oh my bad did I let that slip
I cant forget that quick
Hook
Deceiving you you you you deceiving
Deceiving you you you you are so deceiving
Speaking
let me see what im gonna say for the second one yeah i got it hold on uh
Deceiving you are the reason that
When it gets cold in November seems like its freezing
And I fit every stereotype that yall believe in
Cuhz when I say Im serious you claim u only Teasin
I plan a trip to the tropics that you missed
So when Im speakin you only in topic when Im pissed
And in a couple of years i guarantee youll be thirsty
And by then Ill be lookin like Tropicana twist twist
What up Tessa I love you like my own mama
And ya daughters getting grown mama
And me Im just here workin waitin patient
For her to be ready to love and leave her drama
Cuhz I dont really wanna fight no more
And I dont wanna diss niggas when I write no more
And I dont wanna bring chicks to the crib
To watch a flick in the basement on the bed with dim lights no more
Now Im losin a feeling
U losin appealing
U need to step it up like prints from shoes on the ceiling
Oh damn did I let that slip oh my fault did I let that slip
I cant forget that quick
Hook
Deceiving you you you you deceiving
Deceiving you you you you are so deceiving
My first reaction was damn girl
How did I swing you
I wanted you forever now Im something you cling to
But u was my angel Seems like ya wings grew
Unaware you was outta state doin ya thing to
Sayin to my self u deceiving
You are the reason that I dont believe in finding the love that I need
And fact I know you always be lyin when u be leavin
Goin to visit family promise me u aint cheatin
A sure thing just might fail you
Women often conduct themselves just like males do
They huddle in a group and joke about the fact that u a soft nigga
How u think cuddling with its cute
They laugh at how u think u last when u really dont
And make u think u get the ass when u really wont
And dudes do that and why these hoes stealin it
They doin the same shit with a better job at concealin it
So sign your name on a pre-nup and in initials
She only messin with a rapper if its beneficial
Opps did I let that slip oh my bad did I let that slip
Hook
Deceiving you you you you deceiving
Deceiving you you you you are so deceiving

Couple things due but you always get it done
Might have been a time when I loved her too
But you take that away and youll always be the one
One I wonder why the moon look nice girl
Maybe its just right for the night
You said niggas coming on too strong girl

Why you want to fight for your right

About the two cents I aint never spent
When they say youre too famous to pack a gat
I gotta remind em about where Im from
Not about where Im going about where Ive gone
Stepping on a Swisher roach like a stepping stone
Goin at a nigga throat like a herringbone
Boy do I smell beef Mmmm pheromones
Got a fuckin halo over my devil horns
Trap pumpin all night like Chevron
Suck a nigga dick for a iPhone six
Fuck my nigga Terry for a new Blackberry
You can get buried for a ounce of Katy Perry
I was only five but still remember the drought in eighty-seven
Lord tell em bitches I aint got no times to play games with em

Tell her that I love her and I hate her in the same sentence

Parmesan my panino
Promethazine over Pinot

New friends all in their old feelings now
They dont love you like they used to manNever thought Id be talking from this perspective
But Im not really sure what else you expected
When the higher-ups have all come together as a collective
With conspiracies to end my run and send me a message
forty Did you get the message
Cause I just checked my phone and I didnt get it
I mean I say hats off for a solid effort
But we didnt flinch for a second we got our shit together
Yeah not here to fight wars
But niggas wanna talk high scores
Party just dipped off in a white Porsche
And I just came from dinner where I ate some well done seared scallops
That were to die for
But I got bigger fish to fry
Im talking bigger shit than you and I
Kidsll lose their lives got me scared of losing mine
And if I hold my tongue about it I get crucified
Wrote this shit on a bumpy flight on a summer night
Flying over Chattanooga out here trying to spread the movement
I just got me the Mercedes Pullman
You niggas never heard of it you gotta hit up Google
Back in the city shit is getting brutal
These kidsll hit your noodle then take a girl to the movies
Theyve been dropping out on both sides
We aint in it we just ghost ride
The pen is working if you niggas need some ghost lines
I thought you wanted yours like I want mine
I guess you just making moves on your own time
But just know itll be January in no time
And your absence is very concerning
Its like you went on vacation with no plan of returning
Shit is purely for sport I need it thirty for thirty
Banners are ready in case we need to retire your jersey
I got a club in the Raptors arena
Championships celebrations during regular seasons
Paternity testing for women that I never slept with
Im legally obligated if they request it
So much legal action like Im Michael Jackson
Luckily Im great at avoiding distraction
Used to get no reaction now Im overreacting
Ah nigga that shit gotta go platinum
I just listened to Closer To My Dreams
Wide eyed and uneducated at nineteen
I cant rap like that all young and naive
Not after all of the shit Ive seen and the things I believe
Drastically changing thank you for all your patience
Im just in a different space and I choose to embrace it
four thousand Square feet just isnt as spacious
You loved me back in the basement guess it is what we make it
Im tired of awkward exchanges and niggas crooked ways
Tired of champagne toasts with people that look away
Peyton and Eli when niggas called me they brother the season start
And I dont wanna see you end up with nothing
Yall throw the word family around too much in discussion
Rookie season I wouldve never thought this was coming
They knees give out and they passing to you all of a sudden
Now you the one getting buckets
They put their arm around you now you becoming the crutches
Kids got on your number cause you the one they look up to
And women that you seen on TV look better in person
And either they wanna fuck you or convince you
That they can to see where it goes from there
But these aint the girls from Brampton this aint that local action
The haters just bringing me and my people closer actually
What happened to the things you niggas said was supposed to happen
Are we just supposed to ignore the fact that it never happened
We just supposed to get the pie and then split it in two
Supposed to forget your mistakes but not forget about you
My plan was always to make the product jump off the shelf
And treat the money like secrets keep that shit to ourselves
Papi champÃº young pablito de seis dios

Youre twenty-seven you just being you
Youre your fathers child man thank God you got some me in you
At least I always at least I always see it through
At least Im always being true to what you taught me
Retired teacher but your words still got me evolving
Never get sloppy drunk but alcohol is problem solving
And look I hate it when you hate on all my girlfriends
And assistants always convinced that theres always someone better
Like that girl from that gym who trains you
I know you wanna arrange it you told me shes free Thursday
And Im sure that shes a angel but she dont want this life
The timing aint right
Maybe one day but even one day with us is a time of a life
We do things that people pay to document
You got the sweetest heart but Im not here to give out compliments or boost nobody confidence momma
I got no friends in this momma
I dont pretend with this momma

Welcome back to the age of jive
Whereve you been hidin out lately honey
You cant dress trashy till you spend a lot of money
Everybodys talkin bout the new sound
Funny but its still rock and roll to me
Whats the matter with the car Im driving
Cant you tell that its out of style
Should I get a set of white wall tires
Are you gonna cruise the miracle mile
Nowadays you cant be too sentimental
Your best bets a true baby blue Continental
Hot funk cool punk even if its old junk
Its still rock and roll to me
Oh it doesnt matter what they say in the papers
Cause its always been the same old scene
Theres a new band in town
But you cant get the sound from a story in a magazine
Aimed at your average teen
How about a pair of pink sidewinders
And a bright orange pair of pants
You could really be a Beau Brummel baby
If you just give it half a chance
Dont waste your money on a new set of speakers
You get more mileage from a cheap pair of sneakers
Next phase new wave dance craze anyways
Its still rock and roll to me
Whats the matter with the crowd Im seeing
Dont you know that theyre out of touch
Should I try to be a straight A student
If you are then you think too much
Dont you know about the new fashion honey
All you need are looks and a whole lotta money
Its the next phase new wave dance craze anyways
Its still rock and roll to me
Everybodys talkin bout the new sound
Funny but its still rock and roll to meOh man

Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
Ever since I left the city you
Got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl you got me down you got me stressed out
Cause ever since I left the city you
Started wearing less and goin out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin with some girls Ive never seen before
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
Ever since I left the city you you you
You and me we just dont get along
You make me feel like I did you wrong
Going places where you dont belong
Ever since I left the city you
You got exactly what you asked for
Running out of pages in your passport
Hanging with some girls Ive never seen before
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
These days all I do is
Wonder if you bendin over backwards for someone else
Wonder if your rollin backwoods for someone else
Doing things I taught you gettin nasty for someone else
You dont need no one else
You dont need nobody else no
Why you never alone
Why you always touching road
Used to always stay at home be a good girl
You was in the zone
You should just be yourself
Right now youre someone else
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
Ever since I left the cityYeah oh you gotta love it
Oh you got oh you gotta love it
I heard what circulated lets get to the bottom of it
I told oneda send me something and I got it covered
Somehow always rise above it
Why you think I got my head in the clouds on my last album cover
The game is all mine and Im mighty possessive
Lil Wayne could not have found him a better successor
Every shot you see them take at me They all contested
Allen Iverson shoe deal these niggas all in question
Last night I went to sleep wanted more
Tried to decide what direction I should go towards
Some nights I wish I could go back in life
Not to change shit just to feel a couple things twice
twenty-eight at midnight wonder whats next for me
Longevity wonder how long theyll check for me
Prolly forever if I stay in my zone
I speak on this generation but cant change it alone
I heard a lil lil homie talking reckless in Vibe
Quite a platform you chose you shoulda kept it inside
Oh you tried its so childish calling my name on the world stage
You need to act your age and not your girls age
It gets worse by the annual my careers like a how to manual
So I guess its understandable man
Oh you gotta love it you gotta love it cheer
I know rappers that call Paparazzi to come and get em
To show they outfits off guess they need the attention
I remember when it used to be music that did it
But then again times have changed man who are we kiddin
Im managed by my friends that I grew up with
Id rather give that fifteen to people I fuck with
If me and Future hadnt made it with this rappin
We prolly be out in Silicon tryna get our billions on
But here we are yeah
Lately I feel the haters eatin away at my confidence
They scream out my failures and whisper my accomplishments
Bitches alter my message like we have words
And stories bout my life hit the net like a bad serve
Bitter women Im overtextin are PMSing crazy this year
Fuckin with my image
Ive been tryna reach to you so I can save em this year
Fuck it I guess I gotta wait til next year
And I heard someone say something that stuck with me a lot
Bout how we need protection from those protectin the block
Nobody lookin out for nobody
Maybe we should try and help somebody or be somebody
Instead of bein somebody that makes the news
So everybody can tweet about it
And then they start to RIP about it
And four weeks later nobody even speaks about it
Damn I just had to say my piece about it
Oh you gotta love it
But they scared of the truth so back to me showin out in public
Thats a hotter subject
Ive been whippin Mercedes and nigga try to budget
I gotta make it back to Memphis to check on my cousins
Shout out to Ashley Biama Julia Ericka Southern America
Part of my heritage pardon my arrogance part in my hair again
Thats that comeback flow comeback flow
Once I start its apparent
I wanted a girl whose ass is so big thats partly embarrassin
But fuck all the blushin and fuck your discussions
And fuck all the judgement
Your content so aggressive lately whats irkin you
Shit is gettin so personal in your verses too
I wanna prove that Im number one over all these niggas
Bein number two is just being the first to lose
My city dictated music nobody seein us
Winter here already but somehow Im heatin up
Been observin the game and felt like Ive seen enough
Lets drop a tape on these niggas then well see whats up
Yea boy you rappin like you seen it all
You rappin like the throne should be the three of yall
Best I Ever Had seems like a decade ago
Decadent flow and I still got a decade to go
Oh please take at ease wheres the love and the peace
Why you rappin like you come from the streets
I got a backyard where money seems to come from the trees
And Im never ever scared to get some blood on my leaves
Phantom slidin like the shit just hit a puddle of grease
I cook the beef well done on the double with cheese
Special order for anybody thats comin for me
Shit you probably flinch if somebody sneeze
You see they got me back like its just forty Oli and me
Cuttin all loose ends I be the barber for free
Im almost at four minutes going off on the beat
Feel like Im in the Malibu that had the cloth on the seats
Man oh you gotta love it
And on top of that its getting harder to eat
Rappers downgrading houses
Putting cars on the lease
To think labels said they had a problem marketing me
And now its everybody else thats getting hard to believeI wake up on a daily basis
I count this money up Im already rich
I go so hard with these riches
I fell in love as a dodie
I fell in love with the Rollie
I wake up pray every morning
These demons they callin my soul
I said fuck all of you hoes
Im ballin outta control
Im ballin outta control
If I can give everything back to you
All this passion I got all I ever needed
For me to move on and succeed
For me to move on and succeed
Jealousy envy and greed
Too much of that shit I dont need it
I turned on the gas with a nickle plated
I sit back and laugh cause these niggas traitors
Mentally none of this shit can phase me
Mentally none of this shit can phase me
I came out of trenches I really made it
I come out the gutter I really made it
I stack up the butter I gotta save it
Stack up the cheddar you gotta save it
Shoot out the car with no lovey dovey
These bitches they lookin for hubbie hubbie
Im lookin for paper in any city
I got a bitch located in every city
Gotta have em sticks on us in every city
Take the private its ugly out here we gettin it
Spent like seven hundred thousand on both the Bentleys
I got love for the city I juug and get it
I wake up on a daily basis
I count the money man Im already rich
I go so hard with these riches
I fell in love with the dodie
I fell in love with the Rollie
Wake up and pray every morning
Demons they callin my soul

I need acknowledgement If I got it then tell me I got it then
Im ballin outta control keep on receiving the scholarships
Mail comin to the house nigga please watch your mouth

And I rock Kentucky blue on these hoes
Drafted Im gettin choose by these hoes
Usually they just leave when we done
I dont wanna share no room with these hoes
Metro gon make it boom on these hoes
And me I just stick and move on these hoes
We got that purple rain for the pain
My niggas we aint change we aint change
I wake up on a daily basis
I count this money up Im already rich
I go so hard with these riches
I fell in love as a dodie
I fell in love with the Rollie
I wake up pray every morning

Sipping on Dom PÃrignon for no reason
Popping tags upper echelon for no reason
Seen this bad little jawn she was perfect
Ill let her push the foreign right now if she worth it
Balling in the middle of the club no jersey
I dont want no liquor cause I been drinking that dirty
Bring that Ace bought a case my niggas with me
Bring some ice for my cup I drink with me
Diamond diamond diamond diamonds on me dancing
Diamond diamond diamond diamonds on me dancing
Diamond diamond diamond diamonds on me dancing
Diamond diamond diamond diamonds on me dancing
And you know what I need from you when I get home
You better not be on the phone
Talking up a storm like you usually do
Talking up your friends like you usually do
Telling them I never spend time with you
Its hard to find a time we been
Sipping on Dom PÃrignon for no reason
Popping tags upper echelon for no reason
Seen this bad little jawn she was perfect
Ill let her push the foreign right now if she worth it
Balling in the middle of the club no jersey
I dont want no liquor cause I been drinking that dirty
Bring that Ace bought a case my niggas with me
Bring some ice for my cup I drink with me
Diamond diamond diamond diamonds on me dancing
Diamond diamond diamond diamonds on me dancing
Diamond diamond diamond diamonds on me dancing

Im familiar with this cash flow
And if you juggin you can vouch for me

Girl them late nights aint good for you
Really starting to show on you
Dont hit me up when its good for you
UngratefulThis here is on some truthful shit
It seems like everything I do your used to it
And I hate hearing stories bout who youve been with
Thats when I gotta hide what Im feeling inside
So you still think Im confident and damn
Is this gonna last Your up on a pedastool
Are we moving too fast
Feel like Im in crazy competition with the past
Thats why I gotta ask is anything Im doing brand new
Brand new brand new brand new brand new
Is anything Im doing brand new
Brand new brand new brand new brand new brand new
This here is something personal
Highly doubt this feeling is reversible
Knowledge is pain and that is why it hurts to know
That you attempt to hide and put mistakes aside
So I dont ever question you and damn
I cant even find the perfect brush
So I can paint whats going through my mind
Racing against myself but Im a couple steps behind
Thats why I gotta ask is anything Im doing brand new
Brand new brand new brand new brand new
Is anything Im doing brand new
Brand new brand new brand new brand new
Brand new girl
Is anything Im doing brand new
Is everything Im doing too late

Did you spend the night in his bed on the very first date
Tell me baby am I too lateChorus
I did it all on my own
Turned a chair to a throne
Im a king in this world
Stunt hard
I put my whole city on
To some things that they never wouldve known

So many spins my records is motherfuckin dizzy
Haters wanna turn to their girl and be like Who Is He
But I bet a million she tell you thats motherfuckin Drizzy
And Im focused on my survival
Keep an eye on the door focus on my arrival
Who do you look up to when youre better then your idols
And how you posed to look when you do it with your eyes closed
Im everything you just havent become
I spend my time trying to outdo what hasnt been done
Now hopefully let them see
What they say that Im gon be
And if not our whole future does in the memory of me
Get your team in order assembly is key
And all my niggas shut up at the mention of a plea
They rather be apprehended and keep quiet then to be
On the stand jeopardizing every inch of their loyalty
Pick a lane pick a lane Thats all I ever heard
But Im just trying to swerve
Without hitting the curb
Thats why I spend thousands on bottles so I can pop them
And take photos wit hater niggas and crop them
I am not them I Photoshop them out
Cause they dont understand what Im about
Yeah
The Chris Paul
Of this fall
Sittin this tall
I float high
Goodbye
I will miss yall
Chorus
Lil Wayne

You cant get on my level cause I am so unleveled
Im a young rebel
And I got a baby face

When you are wet and covered in sweat
Ill wipe ya ass down like Boosie baby
I love all my feedback
Tell me to give it to ya if you need that
Touch right there whatever the speeds at

Forget what you guess that Im on and who is in your past
Im refreshing and grown
Just charge that cell that I message you on
And if you lets us girl Imma bring the dressing along
You hear that professional tone
Half of thats ice and the rest is Patron
Show up on time for the class Im teaching
Cause guaranteed Imma bring a lesson along
And you just gotta bring the breastes along
Instead of holding out wondering what it coulda been
I confess this address to you
And Im the post man looking for a slot I can put it in
With no New York number mom still upstairs
Im two floors under but my rooms sound proof
You so tempted to satisfy your urge so you dont wonder
Yeah

Cause mines it Polo and yours is Vickie
And they just spread all over the floor like

She said they love me unconditional
Imagine how I feel to watch another nigga at the top
You know that if it wasnt you you would be dissin you dawg
Damn okay from that perspective
I see what youre talkin bout no way to soften that
Cause me I was tryna find out where I lost em at
But maybe I aint lose em at all
Maybe I keep movin forward and theyre just stagnant they aint movin at all
But when they need a favor who do they call
Maybe Im searchin for the problems askin what was said and who was involved
Too focused on peoples feedback and provin em wrong
They say the shoe can always fit no matter whose foot its on
These days feel like Im squeezin in em
Whoever wore em before just wasnt thinkin big enough
Im bout to leave em with em
Cause if I run in the game in these man the seams are splittin
No pun intended but theyre smellin defeat in the air
Headed where nobody took it who meetin me there
They tell him that hes talkin crazy but he doesnt care
Bein humble dont work as well as bein aware

You know years ago they had the AR men to tell you what to play
How to play it and you know whether its disco and rock
But um we just went in the studio and we did it
We had champagne in the studio of course you know
Compliments of the company and we just laid back and did it
So we hope you enjoy listening to this album half as much
As we enjoyed playing it for you because we had a ball
Only real music is gonna last
All the other bullshit is here today and gone tomorrow
Cash rules everything around me
CREAM get the money dolla-dolla bill yall
After hours of Il Mulino
Or Sotto Sotto just talkin about women and vino
The contract like ninety-one Dan Marino
I swear this got Michael Rapino boostin my ego
Overly focused its far from the time to rest now
Debates growing bout who they think is the best now
Took a while got the jokers out of the deck now
Im holdin all the cards and niggas wanna play chess now
I hear you talkin say it twice so I know you meant it
Fuck it I dont even tint it they should know whos in it
Im authentic real name no gimmicks
No game no scrimmage I aint playin with you niggas at all
My classmates they went on to be chartered accountants
Or work with their parents but thinkin back on how they treated me
My high school reunion might be worth an appearance
Make everybody have to go through security clearance
Tables turn bridges burn you live and learn
With the ink I could murder word to my nigga Irv
Yeah I swear shit just started clickin dog
You know its real when you are who you think you are
Cash rules everything around me
CREAM get the money dolla-dolla bill yall
Cash rules everything around me
CREAM get the money dolla-dolla bill yall
Uh I had Benzes fore you had braces

Insides whiter than Katy Perrys face is
Yellow diamonds in my JesÃºs
I just might learn to speak Mandarin
Japanese for the yen that Im handlin
International Hov thats my handle
My saints Sean Don light a candle
El Gran Santo on the mantle
Case yall didnt know I speak Spanish too
Shoutout to Worldwide Wes
Everywhere we go we leave a worldwide mess

When Im bout to drop somethin crazy and I say Im the greatest of my generation
Like I should be dressin different
Like I should be less aggressive and pessimistic
Like I should be way more nervous and less dismissive
Like I should be on my best behavior
And not talk my shit and do it major like the niggas who paved the way for us
Like I didnt study the game to the letter
And understand that Im not doin it the same man Im doin it better
Like I didnt make that clearer this year
Like I should feel I dont know guilty for saying that
They should put a couple more mirrors in here so I can stare at myself
These are usually just some thoughts that I would share with myself
But I thought Fuck it
Its worth it to share em with someone else more than Paris for once
I text her from time to time she a mom now
I guess sometimes life forces us to calm down
I told her she could live with me if she need to
I got a compound but I think shes straight
Cause she supported since Hot Beats right before Wayne came
And got me out of the backroom where I was rapping with Jas over beats I shouldnt have in the hopes for the glory
He walked right past in the hallway three months later Im his artist
He probably wouldnt remember that story
But that shit stick with me
Always couldnt believe when he called me
You never know it could happen to you
And I just spent four Ferraris all on a brand new Bugatti

I want to get back to when I was that kid in the basement
I want to take it deeper than money vacation
And influence a generation thats lackin in patience
Ive been dealin with my dad speakin of lack of patience
Just me and my old man gettin back to basics
Weve been talkin bout the future and time that we wasted
When he put that bottle down girl that man is amazin
Well we had a couple Coronas
We might have rolled a white paper just somethin to hold us
We even talked about you in our couple of moments
He said we should hash it out like a couple of grown ups

She said they love me unconditional
Imagine how I feel to watch another nigga at the top
You know that if it wasnt you you would be dissin you dawg
Damn okay from that perspective
I see what youre talkin bout no way to soften that
Cause me I was tryna find out where I lost em at
But maybe I aint lose em at all
Maybe I keep movin forward and theyre just stagnant they aint movin at all
But when they need a favor who do they call
Maybe Im searchin for the problems askin what was said and who was involved
Too focused on peoples feedback and provin em wrong
They say the shoe can always fit no matter whose foot its on
These days feel like Im squeezin in em
Whoever wore em before just wasnt thinkin big enough
Im bout to leave em with em
Cause if I run in the game in these man the seams are splittin
No pun intended but theyre smellin defeat in the air
Headed where nobody took it who meetin me there
They tell him that hes talkin crazy but he doesnt care
Bein humble dont work as well as bein aware
Listen up boy youre better off eavesdroppin
We already got spring two thousand and fifteen poppin
PND droppin Reps-up P droppin
Majid Jordan droppin OB droppin not to mention me droppin
Feel like we paid the refs off man we fixed the game

Those nights when you need someone else call me over
You can be the one to take control call me over

Interlude

To me its hard to tell what you really want
Quit acting mean to me
You teasing me the way you flaunt
But you aint hearing me
Sincerely Im so attracted pictures of target practice
Making love on my mattress visions getting graphic
So realistic you could grab it Its a proven fact
Baby gotta have it
My love making quite magic
Trix is for kids bunny rabbit
Let a man have it
But youd be satisfied if you tried my habit
High performance hard to handle
Thinking in the bubble bath while Im burning candles
Sex me like the slow song
If fucking you is bad baby then Im so wrong
My feelings so strong
I keep staring like you cant see me
I never planned a scam my thoughts ran freely
Theres no need to be paranoid
Aint nothing popping
I aint worried bout your man baby girl cause Im just watching
Chorus
Just watching not buying anythingverse one
I lay awake tonight because I want to be with you
If you were beside me Id playful kiss you
Each time I see you the feeling gets stronger
We sit a bit closer and stare alot longer
Reach for my drink and for a second we touch
Went to mutter I stuttered cause I want you that much
The situation is a no win cause hes my best friend
But now Im guilty of falling for his girl friend
Its like a trap that Im sinking into
I wake up sweaty when Im sleeping cause Im thinking of you
Then we make eye contact and I cant fall back
Try to shake it but the feeling comes right back
Now Im confused cause Im no Casanova
But you keep calling me saying to come over
What do I do you make it hard for me to choose
What I wont do for love
TalkingChorusXthreeWhat you wont Do For Love
Scars tears on your pillow and you still stay
As you sit and pray hoping the beatings will go away
And wasnt always a hit and run relationship
It use to be lovehappiness and companionship
Way back when he treated you good
moved you up to the hills
Out of the ills of the ghetto hood
You felt as though you owed him your life
It felt right you said yes and now youre really his wife
He got you pregnant but the baby just wouldnt live
Stuff that she couldnt give
So things got negative
And thats when a stranger came through
And hes pestering you about the things you couldnt do
You said you happy at home right
But thats just a lie as you cry through a long night
Until I came to rescue you making you choose
What you wont do for loveRichie Rich Pac

Yeah Thug life babyBlack cotton
Black cotton
Black cotton a symbol for unrewarded struggle
Time for a little gospel tail
Ghetto gospel that is- listen
Robbin Black Cotton in Gods eyes
Speak
Black Cotton
Steady stressin Smith and Wessons count my blessins
Class is in session the worst question is the first question
Why do we work like slaves sweatin blades to an early grave
Never got paid but still we slave In the nine tre
Answer that then answer this too-
Loves gonna get ya you know its true lifes a bitch true
You best to backtrack and try to act black and live
Not to be phony and positive but why be negative
Whats the matter G Black cat got your tongue
Fat track gotcha sprung now your hung Do ya feel me
Dumb dumb diddy is it me
Attempt to reach each and every brother on the streets
If not peace then at least lets get a piece
Im tired of seeing bodies on the streets- deceased
Lookin through my high school yearbook
Reminiscin of the tears as the years took
One homie two homie three homies poof
We used to have troops but now theres no more youth to shoot
God come save the misbegotten
Lost ghetto souls of Black Cotton In Gods eyes
Nobody dont care
No matter how hard I try look to the sky
Nobody dont care
Seems like my dreams drowned in by screams no answer to my questions
Nobody dont care
Feels like Im pressed why do I stress Its like Im being tested
Nobody dont care
Seems like my prayers vanish to thin air please answer my questions
Nobody dont care
In the belly of the beast Im bubbling up
Running out of luck about to self destruct
Old heads say live your life like such
Your sure to catch her witcha one day boy
I wouldnt listen to em
Your power movement was cool
But it aint fix nothin
So I just go with what I know
I dont trust none
Look what the eightys did
To whats Bebes kids
And now we grown up
Nobody aint own us yet
Black cotton Im plottin
Im workin without a profit
They shacklin all my homies
Im hurtin but keep the mind

Certainly we survive with Outlaw Ridas
Whats the reward for a strugala
If the lord lovin us then why they hate to see us comin up
Runnin up Gun cocked like nasty gloves
If you aint got a penny mind the glove
No love
Waitin for my forty acas and a blunt to blaze
Biblicle times good hearts with militia minds
Black Cotton Im hoppin over enemy lines
Black Cotton I aint stoppin till they givin me mine
Black Cotton
Nobody dont care
No matter how hard I try look to the sky
Nobody dont care
Seems like my dreams drowned in by screams no answer to my questions
Nobody dont care
Feels like Im pressed why do I stress Its like Im being tested
Nobody dont care
Seems like my prayers vanish to thin air please answer my questions
Nobody dont careUh hit em with a little ghetto gospel
Those who wish to follow me
My ghetto gospel
I welcome with my hands
And the red sun sinks at last
Into the hills of gold
And peace to this young warrior
Without the sound of guns
If I could recollect before my hood days
I sit and reminisce
Thinking of bliss and the good days
I stop and stare at the younger
My heart goes to em
They tested with stress that they under
And nowadays things change
Everyones ashamed of the youth cause the truth look strange
And for me its reversed
We left em a world thats cursed
And it hurts
Cause any day theyll push the button
And all come in like Malcolm X or Bobby Hutton died for nothing
Dont it make you get teary
The world looks dreary
When you wipe your eyes see it clearly
Theres no need for you to fear me
If you take your time and hear me
Maybe you can learn to cheer me
It aint about black or white cause we human
I hope we see the light before its ruined my ghetto gospel
Those who wish to follow me
My ghetto gospel
I welcome with my hands
And the red sun sinks at last
Into the hills of gold
And peace to this young warrior
Without the sound of guns
Tell me do you see that old lady
Aint it sad
Living out of bags
Plus shes glad for the little things she has
And over there theres a lady
Crack got her crazy
Guess whos giving birth to a baby
I dont trip or let it fade me
From out of the fryin pan
We jump into another form of slavery
Even now I get discouraged
Wonder if they take it all back
Will I still keep the courage
I refuse to be a role model
I set goals take control drink out my own bottles
I make mistakes but learn from every one
And when its said and done
I bet this brother be a better one
If I upset you dont stress never forget
That God isnt finished with me yet
I feel his hand on my brain
When I write rhymes I go blind and let the Lord do his thing
But am I less holy
Cause I chose to puff a blunt and drink a beer with my homies
Before we find world peace
We gotta find peace and end the war in the streets
My ghetto gospel
Those who wish to follow me
My ghetto gospel
I welcome with my hands
And the red sun sinks at last
Into the hills of gold
And peace to this young warrior
Without the sound of guns
Lord can you hear me speak
To pay the price of being hellboundThug for life nigga

Nigga pass me the blunt and let me roll it
You get the bones act to the whole stack thats fo sho black
To be a mack and keep your dough fat
And tell me what does it take to be a G

You gotta watch your back stay strapped be alert
Started as a young muthafucka doin dirt
And now Im in the rap game like the crack game I got enemies
Cant pretend to see my friends are not my enemies
And even thug muthafuckas wanna have fun
Stuck it buckin my muthafuckin Magnum what does it take to be a G
Silence is a must violence is a plus plus shots at my adversaries

Pardon me Incomprehensible God has been kind and
Try me Ill be damned if I die come look at the rage in my eyes G
They got my homies in a jail cell
Now its the rebel and the devil and one of us is goin to hell
I got the whole place covered with loced out brothers
And nothin but love for each other
So motherfucker make a motion
I give a fuck slice you up and throw your ass in the ocean
Temperatures drop see its cool to shoot a nigga
But they hate it when we pop the cops
Thats when they gettin petrol
You better watch your step or youll be left on deathrow
But I learned to look ahead of me
Stay strapped watch your back keep your eyes on the enemy
We blowin up precincts and you cant fuck with the crew
A crooked nigga too
Its all up to you
But until then I gotta do what I do and stay a crooked
And maybe then youll see the truth
But until then I gotta do what I do and stay a crooked nigga too
Its all up to you
But until then I gotta do what I do and stay a crooked nigga too
And maybe then youll see the truth
Ooh you cant fuck with the crew a crooked nigga tooI aint got time for this man Im out
You should stop for awhile you will find me standing there Dont you trust me
Over here at the side of your life Not that I dont trust you
You spend all your hours just rushing around
Do you have a little time to have a little time for me
As soon as I leave the house you want to page me
See you got me trapped Im going crazy this is slavery
You act like its outrageous give me space it wont get better
And maybe we will argue and be through with all these sorry letters
Soon as I come home its like I get the third degree
Where ya been and who you with I get no room to breathe It makes me want to leave
Im sick of these tricks up your sleeve
Your suspicious I deceive give me grief without belief but to me
If you really trust me then its pitiful
Question me about my whereabouts thats so trivial
Let me live my life and you can live yours
Just be there to help me and support thats what your here for
Not to give me stress and add to pressure
Home is where I go the rest I go to pass the test
Im sorry if I left you all alone
But I couldnt make it home so we argue on the phone
Dont you trust me
You should stop for awhile you will find me standing there Dont you trust me
Over here at the side of your life Not that I dont trust you
You spend all your hours just rushing around
Do you have a little time to have a little time for me
Callin up my house to hang it up You think that makes sense
Tell me what it takes for us to shake so we can be friends
Its time for us to take our separate paths
We had a lot of laughs but the good things come to pass
Lets think of the evil break dont make it scandoulous
Try to be mature til your sure that we can handle this
Your sayin Im too busy I ignore you
I guess you didnt hear me when I said that I cared for you
But now it seems the arguments are nightly
I want to hold you tightly but instead you want to fight me
So why let it stress and aggravate me
Instead Id rather break hope you dont hate me
You tell me that you love me but your lyin
Fightin back the urge to start cryin
I wipe away your tears come and hug me
I love you like you love me
Girl dont you trust me
You should stop for awhile you will find me standing there Dont you trust me
Over here at the side of your life Not that I dont trust you
You spend all your hours just rushing around
Do you have a little time to have a little time for me
I hangup the phone click
I cant barely hear you yellin at me
Maybe we should end it neither one of us are happy
You know that Im emotional you milk me
Comin over crying just to get me feelin guilty
You and me were met to be it yet
You always want to sweat and how much closer can we get dont fret
Just set me back my things and Ill be outie
This time Im breakin out you let your mouth overcrowd me
I cant take the beefin and the griefin
I get no room to sleep I hope it ceases cause Im leavin
Maybe next time youll be a little more sure
When I can give you more when you unsure
But baby until then I gotta leave ya
Its not that I dont need ya but see ya
And I hope that you understand why I bust it
Not because we rushed it hell no
But girl dont you trust me
You should stop for awhile you will find me standing there Dont you trust me
Over here at the side of your life Not that I dont trust you
You spend all your hours just rushing around
Do you have a little time to have a little time for me
Not that I dont trust you
Dont you trust me
Not that I dont trust you
Dont you trust me

The first to pull a strap when theres drama
Busta you aint heard
Ive been slicin motherfuckers since I lost my momma
There aint a cop that can stop me
My posse is cocked G and they dont quit until they drop me
Im loyal to the game
Without no doubt I aint no slouch and it aint time to back down
So I jumps in and try to stop-a and watch-a
Slap you cock-eyed like Popeye fucks spinach
Forgotten more shit than most crews ever know or ever knew
Was born with seven flows and only heaven knew
For beat the boot sex the news breaks the you shakes
Worse they heard we got more nerve than a two-fake
Yoo-ho to you crew and you too so you knew

Whose the new crew

Ow pow hurt dont it Bow bow dont run up on it
The same thing minus P hangin possies like an exponent
Oh yes rock in slums ya gots to run it
It makes no sense to smell like shit
If old ass George could be Washing-tons
Now I be loyal to my niggas on the blocks just buckin the shots
And packin the Glocks
And dodgin the cops and takin over niggas spots
Poppin after poppin the fools be droppin the hoes be hoppin
On my thing cause it hangs like the nets from Above the Rim
You lookin grim is it me or him or him
Or be with me we be together
So whats up We can do whatever
Cause real niggas stick together
Till they make it up to heaven
Through the stress through the hell through the one-eight-seven
The shorter the nigga the bigga the trigga
The deeper they dig the ditch-a
The Naughty the Treach
Then through to the Pac I brings the Glock I wets up
You fuckin body Im like oh my Gody
Did I really shoot him Yo I shot him
So got him now I puts the crime behind me
And finds me a place to lays my head low

Gettin pages from my bitch its time to dick her
I aint in love with her I just wanna be the one to hit her
Drop off and let the next nigga get her
Thats the way it goes its time to shake a ho make the dough
Break a ho when its time to make some mo
I keep my finger on the trigger of my Glock
Ridin down the block lickin shots at the punk-ass cops
And spittin game through my mobile phone
The type of shit to get them hoes to bone

Straight muthafuckin ballinLate night coolin with my homies
Drinkin Hennessey an cold brew
After smokin stopped in Oakland
Got the munchies for some soul food
So we stopped to get a bite to eat
At the local barbecue
Its just another borin Monday
An theres nothin else to do
Now as we stepped out of the car
I heard someone behind me fightin
So I turned to look and find out
Whats the cause of this excitement
One brother was a dopefiend
And the other was a dopeman
And the dopeman had a AK
Said hell spray an hes not jokin
Well it seems to be the dopefiend
Owed the dopeman for his product
And he swore if he did not pay
He would end up gettin shot up
Now I could not walk away
Cause I got caught up in the scene
Wonderin what would happen
To this poor and helpless fiend
Well my homie Michael Cooley
Said lets go and make our order
Whats the use in watchin two men
Stand out here fight over quarters
Well I walked inside the diner
And all the dopefiends waved to me
Heard the sound of several gunshots
And I ran outside to see
Whats goin on
Another gunshot rings
Whats goin on
Another siren rings
Whats goin on
Another mother cries
Whats goin on
Cause another innocent dies
Whats goin on
Whats goin on
Another gunshot rings
Whats goin on
Another siren rings
Whats goin on
Another mother cries
Whats goin on
Cause another innocent dies
Whats goin on
All the people in the diner
Ran outside to see the big show
It was just another party
For them to see just who they would know
But for me I held concern
I wanted to go see the outcome
Would a mother have a son tonight
Or would she live her life without one
I made it to the streets
I almost cried right on the spot
Not only had the fiend died
But a small girl had been shot
My heart could take no more
I felt a tear roll down my face
That was daddys bullet
But she took it in his place
Whats goin on
Another gunshot rings
Whats goin on
Another siren rings
Whats goin on
Another mother cries
Whats goin on
Cause another innocent dies
Whats goin on
Whats goin on
Another gunshot rings
Whats goin on
Another siren rings
Whats goin on
Another mother cries
Whats goin on
Cause another innocent dies
Whats goin on
Tried to make way through the crowd
So I could go help the baby
She could barely speak but she whispered
Mister can you please save me
So I screamed out Someone help me
But I dont think they could hear
And if they did they didnt care
Oh how I hated everyone there
The baby lie here dyin
And I wondered what could I do
The cameraman and newspapers
Had come to get their interviews
To them its just story
And they cant see the tragedy
To them it doesnt matter
Cause hey it wasnt their family
I dont think Ill be back
Cause itll never be the same here
So I wipe away the tears
And leave the scene the way I came here
Though some people say its crazy
And the food could have been finer
Ill never forget
Never forget the night at Dopefiends Diner
Whats goin on
Another gunshot rings
Whats goin on
Another siren rings
Whats goin on
Another mother cries
Whats goin on
Cause another innocent dies
Whats goin on
Whats goin on
Another gunshot rings
Whats goin on
Another siren rings
Whats goin on
Another mother cries
Whats goin on
Cause another innocent dies
Whats goin onNow Ive got to ask on a niggas ass tell me will they blast me

Quiet yall
Incoming call
Plus this my homie from high school
Hes getting bye
Its time to bury another brotha nobody cry
Life as a baller
Alcohol and booty calls
We usta do them as adolecents
Do you recall
Raised as Gs
Loced out and blazed the weed
Get on tha roof
Lets get smoked out
And blaze with me
two in tha morning
And we still high assed out
Screamin thug till I die
Before I passed out
But now that your gone
Im in tha zone
Thinkin
I dont wanna die all alone
But now ya gone
And all I got left are stinkin memories
I love them niggas to death
Im drinkin Hennessy
While tryin ta make it last
I drank a fiveth for that ass
When you passed
Cause life goes on
How many brothers fell victim to the streets
Rest in peace young nigga theres a Heaven for a G
Be a lie If I told ya that I never thought of death
My niggas we tha last ones left
But life goes on
How many brothers fell victim to the streets
Rest in peace young nigga theres a Heaven for a G
Be a lie If I told ya that I never thought of death
My niggas we tha last ones left
But life goes on
Yeah nigga
I got tha word as hell
Ya blew trial and tha judge gave you
twenty-five with an L
Time to prepare to do fed time
Wont see parole
Imagine life as a convict
Thats gettin old
Plus with tha drama
Were lookin out for your babys mama
Taken risks while keepin cheap tricks from gettin on her
Life in tha hood
Is all good for nobody
Remember gamin on dumb hotties at chill parties
Me and you
No true a two
While scheming on hits
And gettin tricks
That maybe we can slide into
But now you buried
Rest nigga
Cause I aint worried
Eyes blurry
Sayin goodbye at the cemetary
Tho memories fade
I got your name tated on my arm
So we both ball till my dying days
Before I say goodbye
Kato and Mental rest in peace
Thug till I die
How many brothers fell victim to the streets
Rest in peace young nigga theres a Heaven for a G
Be a lie If I told ya that I never thought of death
My niggas we tha last ones left
But life goes on
How many brothers fell victim to the streets
Rest in peace young nigga theres a Heaven for a G
Be a lie If I told ya that I never thought of death
My niggas we tha last ones left
But life goes on
Bury me smilin
With Gs in my pocket
Have a party at my funeral
Let every rapper rock it
Let tha hoes that I usta know
From way before
Kiss me from my head to my toe
Give me a paper and a pen
So I can write about my life of sin
A couple bottles of Gin
In case I dont get in
Tell all my people Im a Ridah
Nobody cries when we die
We outlaws
Let me ride
Until I get free
I live my life in tha fast lane
Got police chasen me
To my niggas from old blocks
From old crews
Niggas that guided me through
Back in tha old school
Pour out some liquor
Have a toast for tha homies
See we both gotta die
But ya chose to go before me
And brothas miss ya while your gone
You left your nigga on his own
How long we mourn
Life goes on
How many brothers fell victim to the streets
Rest in peace young nigga theres a Heaven for a G
Be a lie If I told ya that I never thought of death
My niggas we tha last ones left
But life goes onWhat yall want
Unconditional Love no doubt
Talking bout the stuff that dont wear off
It dont fade
Itll last for all these crazy days
These crazy nights
Whether you wrong or you right
Im a still love you
Still feel you
Still there for you
No matter what
You will always be in my heart
With unconditional love
Come listen to my truest thoughts
My truest feelings all my peers doing years beyond drug dealing
How many caskets can we witness
Before we see its hard to live this life without God so we must ask forgiveness
Ask mama why I got this urge to die
Witness the tears falling free from my eyes before she could reply
Though we were born without a silver spoon
My broken down TV show cartoons in my living room hey
One day I hope to make it a player in this game
Mama dont cry long as we try maybe things change
Perhaps its just a fantasy
A life where we dont need no welfare
Shit with our whole family
Maybe its me that caused it the fighting and the hurting
In my room crying cause I didnt want to be a burden
Watch mama open up her arms to hug me
And I aint worried bout a damn thang with unconditional love
In this game the lessons in your eyes to see
Though things change the futures still inside of me
We must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark
So you will always be in my heart with unconditional love
In this game the lessons in your eyes to see
Though things change the futures still inside of me
We must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark
So you will always be in my heart with unconditional love
Just got the message youve been calling all week
Been out here hustling on these streets aint had a chance to speak
But you know with you and me its on G
We could never be enemies
Cause you been such a good friend to me
Where would I be without my dogs
No wonder why when times get hard
Cause it aint easy being who we are
Driven by my ambitions desire higher positions
So I proceed to make Gs eternally in my mission
Is to be more than just a rap musician
The elevation of todays generation
If could make em listen
Prison aint what we need no longer stuck in greed
Time to plan strategize my familys gotta eat
When we make somethin out of nothing
No pleasure in the suffering neighborhood would be good
If they could cut out all the busting
The liquor and the weed the cussing
Sending love out to my block
The struggle never stops unconditional love
In this game the lessons in your eyes to see
Though things change the futures still inside of me unconditional love
We must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark
So you will always be in my heart with unconditional love
In this game the lessons in your eyes to see
Though things change the futures still inside of me unconditional love
We must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark
So you will always be in my heart with unconditional love
Ill probably never understand ya ways
With everyday I swear I hear ya trying to change your ways
While gettin paid at the same time
Just had a baby with the same eyes
Something inside please let me die these are strange times
How come I never made it
Maybe its the way the played it in my heart
I knew one day I gotta be a star
My hopes and all my wishes so many vivid pictures
And all the currency Ill never even get to see
This fast life soon shatters
Cause after all the lights and screams
Nothing but my dreams matter
Hoping for better days
Maybe a peaceful night
Baby dont cry cause everything gonna be alright
Just lay your head on my shoulder
Dont worry bout a thang baby girl Im a soldier
Never treated me bad no matter who I was
You still came with that unconditional love
In this game the lessons in your eyes to see
Though things change the futures still inside of me unconditional love
We must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark
So you will always be in my heart with unconditional love
In this game the lessons in your eyes to see
Though things change the futures still inside of me unconditional love
We must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark
So you will always be in my heart with unconditional love
In this game the lessons in your eyes to see

With the S-N double-O-P Dogg my fuckin homie

Now Im back in the courtroom waitin on the outcome
Free twoPac is all thats on a niggas mind
But at the same time it seems they tryin to take mine
So Imma get smart and get defensive and shit
And put together a Million March for some gangsta shit
So now they got us laced
Two multimillionare motherfuckers catchin cases
Bitches get ready for the throw down the shits about to go down
Me and Snoop about to clown

You might be deep in this game but you got the rules missing
Niggas be actin like they savage they out to get the cabbage
Ive got nothin but love for my niggas living lavish
Ive got a pit named P she Nigerina
Ive got a house out in the hills right next to Chino
And I think Ive got a black Bimmer
But my dreams to own a fly casino
Like Bugsy Siegel and do it all legal
And get scooped up by the little homie in the Regal uh
It feels good to you baby-bubba
You see this is for the Gs and the keys motherfucker
Now follow as we ride
Motherfuck the rest two of the best from the Westside
And I can make you famous

Now give me fifty feet
Defeat is not my destiny release me to the streets
And keep whatevers left of me
Jealousy is misery suffering is grief
Better be prepared when you cowards fuck with me
I bust and flee
These niggas must be crazy what
There aint no mercy motherfuckers who cant fade the thugs
You thought it was but it wasnt now disappear
Bow down in the presence of a boss player
Its like cough blood gang-bangin
Everybody in the party doin dope-slangin
You gotta have papers in this world
You might get your first snatch before your eyes swirl
You doin your job every day
And then you work so hard til your hair turns gray
Let me tell you about life and about the way it is
You see we live by the gun so we die by the guns kids
They tell me not to roll with my Glock
So now I gotta throw away
Floating in the black Benz trying to do a show a day
They wonder how I live with five shots
Niggas is hard to kill on my block
Schemes for currency and dough-related
Affiliated with the hustlers so we made it
No answers to questions Im trying to get up on it
My nigga Dogg with me eternally the most wanted Aint nothin but a gangsta party

Some where inside my childhood witnessed my heart die
And even though we both came from the same places
The money and the fame made us all change places
How could it be through the misery
That cant get past the hard times
Made a true friend afraid to ask for currency
But you could run to me when you need me Ill never leave
I just needed someone to believe in as you can see
Its a small thang through and true
What could I do Real homies help ya get through
And coming new hed do tha same thang if he could
cause in the hood true homies make you feel good
And happy times we be acting up call tha cops
Bringing the cease to tha peace that was on my block
It never stop when my mama ask me will I change
I tell her yeah but its clear Ill always be tha same
Until the end of time
So take these broken wings
Use your hands to come and heal me once again Until the end of time
So I can fly away until the end of time
Until the end of time until the end of time
Please Lord forgive me for my life of sin
My hard stare seem to scare all my sisters kids
So you know I dont hang around tha house much
Diss all night money making got me outta touch shit
Aint flashed a smile in a long while
An unexpected birth worst of the ghetto childs
My attitude got me walking solo
Ride out alone in my low-low
Watching the whole world move in slow-mo
For quiet times disappear to the ocean
Smoking Ports think my thoughts
Then its back to coasting
Who can I trust in this cold world
My phony homey had a baby by my own girl
But I aint trippin Im a player
I aint sweating him
I sex his sister had her mo good like a Mexican
His next of kin
No remorse it was meant to happen
Besides rapping the only thing I did good was scrapping
Until the end of time
So take these broken wings
Use your hands to come and heal me once again Until the end of time
So I can fly away until the end of time
Until the end of time until the end of time
So take these broken wings
Use your hands to come and heal me once again Until the end of time
So I can fly away until the end of time
Until the end of time until the end of time
Now whos to say if I was right or wrong
To live my life as an outlaw all along
Remain strong in this planet full of playa haters
They conversate but Death Row full of demonstrators
And in tha end drinking henessy made all my enemies envy me
So cold when I flow eliminating easily
Falls to they knees they plead for they right to breath
While beggin me to keep the peace haha
Well I can see close into achieve
In times of danger dont freeze time to be a g
Follow my lead I supply everything you need
An ounce of game and the trainin to make a g
Remember me as an outcast outlaw
Another album out thats what Im about more
Gettin raw till the day I see my casket
Buried as a g while tha whole world remembers me
Until the end of time
So take these broken wings
Use your hands to come and heal me once again Until the end of time
So I can fly away until the end of time
Until the end of time until the end of timeChange shit

Quick to holla at a hoochie with the same line
You was just a little smaller but you still rolled
Got stretched to YA and hit the hood swoll
Member when you had a jheri curl didnt quite learn
On the block witcha glock trippin off sherm
Collect calls to the till sayin how ya changed
Oh you a Muslim now no more dope game
Heard you might be comin home just got bail
Wanna go to the Mosque dont wanna chase tail
I seems I lost my little homie hes a changed man
Hit the pen and now no sinnin is the game plan
When I talk about money all you see is the struggle
When I tell you Im livin large you tell me its trouble
Congratulation on the weddin I hope your wife know
She got a playa for life and thats no bullshittin
I know we grew apart you probably dont remember
I used to fiend for your sister but never went up in her
And I can see us after school wed bomb
On the first motherfucker with the wrong shit on
Now the whole shits changed and we dont even kick it
Got a big money scheme and you aint even with it
Hmm knew in my heart you was the same motherfucker bad
Go toe to toe when its time for roll you got a brothers back
And I cant even trip cause Im just laughin at cha
You tryin hard to maintain then go head
Cause I aint mad at cha
Hmm I aint mad at cha
I aint mad at cha I aint mad at cha
I aint mad at cha
We used to be like distant cousins fightin playin dozens
Whole neighborhood buzzin knowin that we wasnt
Used to catch us on the roof or behind the stairs
Im gettin blitzed and I reminisce on all the times we shared
Besides bumpin n grindin wasnt nothin on our mind
In time we learned to live a life of crime
Rewind us back to a time was much too young to know
I caught a felony lovin the way the guns blow
And even though we separated you said that youd wait
Dont give nobody no coochie while I be locked up state
I kiss my Mama goodbye and wipe the tears from her lonely eyes
Said Ill return but I gotta fight the fates arrived
Dont shed a tear cause Mama I aint happy here
Im through trial no more smiles for a couple years
They got me goin mad Im knockin busters on they backs
In my cell thinkin Hell I know one day Ill be back
As soon as I touch down
I told my girl Ill be there so prepare to get fucked down
The homies wanna kick it but Im just laughin at cha
Cause youse a down ass bitch and I aint mad at cha
I aint mad at cha I aint mad at cha
I aint mad at cha A true down ass bitch afund I aint mad at cha
Well guess whos movin up this niggas ballin now
Bitches be callin to get it hookers keep fallin down
He went from nothin to lots ten carots to rock
Went from a nobody nigga to the big man on the block
Hes Mister local celebrity addicted to move a key
Most hated by enemy escape in the luxury
See first you was our nigga but you made it so the choice is made
Now we gotta slay you why you faded in the younger days
So full of pain while the weapons blaze
Gettin so high off that bomb hopin we make it to the better days
Cause crime pays and in time
Youll find a rhymell blaze youll feel the fire from the niggas in my younger days
So many changed on me so many tried to plot
That I keep a glock beside my head when will it stop
Til God return me to my essence
Cause even as a adolescents I refuse to be a convalescent
So many questions and they ask me if Im still down
I moved up out of the ghetto so I aint real now
They got so much to say but Im just laughin at cha
You niggas just dont know but I aint mad at cha
I aint mad at cha and I aint mad at cha
I aint mad hell nah I aint mad at cha at cha
I aint mad at cha and I aint mad at cha

Got a got a
Baby
Say that one more time Brenda
Brendas
Got a baby
Baby
I hear Brendas got a baby
But Brendas barely got a brain
A damn shame the girl can hardly spell her name
Thats not our problem thats up to Brendas family
Well let me show ya how it affects the whole community
Now Brenda really never knew her moms and her dad was a
Junky went in death to his arms its sad cause I bet
Brenda doesnt even know
Just cause your in the ghetto doesnt mean you cant grow you cant grow
But oh thats a thought my own revelation
Do whatever it takes to resist the temptation
Brenda got herself a boyfriend
Her boyfriend was her cousin now lets watch the joy end
She tried to hide her pregnancy from her family
Who didnt really care to see or give a damn if she
Went out and had a church of kids
As long as when the check came they got first dibs
Now Brendas belly is gettin bigger
But no one seems to notice any change in her figure
Shes twelve years old and shes having a baby
In love with the molester whos sexing her crazy
And yet she thinks that hell be with her forever
And dreams of a world with the two of them are together
Whatever he left her and she had the baby solo
She had it on the bathroom floor and didnt know so
She didnt know what to throw away and what to keep
She wrapped the baby up and threw him in the trash heep
I guess she thought shed get away wouldnt hear the cries
She didnt realize
How much the the little baby had her eyes
Now the babys in the trash heep balling
Momma cant help her but it hurts to hear her calling
Brenda wants to run away
Momma say you makin me lose pay
The social workers here everyday
Now Brendas gotta make her own way
Cant go to her family they wont let her stay
No money no babysitter she couldnt keep a job
She tried to sell crack but end up getting robbed
So now whats next there aint nothing left to sell
So she sees sex as a way of leaving hell
Its paying the rent so she really cant complain
Prostitute found slain and Brendas her name shes got a baby
Baby
Dont you know shes got a
Dont you know shes got a
Dont you know shes got a baby
Dont you know shes got a
Dont you know shes got a
Dont you know shes got a baby
Dont you know shes got a
Dont you know shes got a
Dont you know shes got a baby
Dont you know shes got a
Dont you know shes got a
Dont you know shes got a baby
Dont you know shes got a
Dont you know shes got a
Dont you know shes got a baby
Dont you know shes got a
Dont you know shes got a
Dont you know shes got a babyCome on come on
I see no changes wake up in the morning and I ask myself
Is life worth living should I blast myself
Im tired of bein poor and even worse Im black
My stomach hurts so Im lookin for a purse to snatch
Cops give a damn about a negro
Pull the trigger kill a nigga hes a hero
Give the crack to the kids who the hell cares
One less hungry mouth on the welfare
First ship em dope and let em deal the brothers
Give em guns step back watch em kill each other
Its time to fight back thats what Huey said
Two shots in the dark now Hueys dead
I got love for my brother but we can never go nowhere
Unless we share with each other
We gotta start makin changes
Learn to see me as a brother instead of two distant strangers
And thats how its supposed to be
How can the Devil take a brother if hes close to me
Id love to go back to when we played as kids
But things changed and thats the way it is
Thats just the way it is
Things will never be the same
Thats just the way it is
Aww yeah
Thats just the way it is
Things will never be the same
Thats just the way it is
Aww yeah
I see no changes all I see is racist faces
Misplaced hate makes disgrace to races
We under I wonder what it takes to make this
One better place lets erase the wasted
Take the evil out the people theyll be acting right
Cause both black and white is smokin crack tonight
And only time we chill is when we kill each other
It takes skill to be real time to heal each other
And although it seems heaven sent
We aint ready to see a black President uhh
It aint a secret dont conceal the fact
The penitentiarys packed and its filled with blacks
But some things will never change
Try to show another way but you stayin in the dope game
Now tell me whats a mother to do
Bein real dont appeal to the brother in you
You gotta operate the easy way
I made a G today But you made it in a sleazy way
Sellin crack to the kid I gotta get paid
Well hey well thats the way it is
Thats just the way it is
Things will never be the same
Thats just the way it is
Aww yeah
Thats just the way it is
Things will never be the same
Thats just the way it is
Aww yeah
We gotta make a change
Its time for us as a people to start makin some changes
Lets change the way we eat lets change the way we live
And lets change the way we treat each other
You see the old way wasnt working so its on us to do
What we gotta do to survive
And still I see no changes cant a brother get a little peace
Its war on the streets and the war in the Middle East
Instead of war on poverty they got a war on drugs
So the police can bother me
And I aint never did a crime I aint have to do
But now Im back with the blacks givin it back to you
Dont let em jack you up back you up
Crack you up and pimp smack you up
You gotta learn to hold ya own
They get jealous when they see ya with ya mobile phone
But tell the cops they cant touch this
I dont trust this when they try to rush I bust this
Thats the sound of my tool you say it aint cool
My mama didnt raise no fool
And as long as I stay black I gotta stay strapped
And I never get to lay back
Cause I always got to worry bout the pay backs
Some buck that I roughed up way back
Comin back after all these years
Rat-a-tat-tat-tat-tat thats the way it is uhh
Thats just the way it is
Things will never be the same
Thats just the way it is
Aww yeah
Thats just the way it is
Things will never be the same
Thats just the way it is
Aww yeah
Some things will never changeI shall not fear no man but God
Though I walk through the valley of death
I shed so many tears if I should die before I wake
Please God walk with me grab a nigga and take me to Heaven
Back in elementary I thrived on misery
Left me alone I grew up amongst a dyin breed
Inside my mind couldnt find a place to rest
Until I got that Thug Life tatted on my chest
Tell me can you feel me Im not livin in the past you wanna last
Be tha first to blast remember Kato
No longer with us hes deceased
Call on the sirens seen him murdered in the streets
Now rest in peace
Is there heaven for a G Remember me
So many homies in the cemetery shed so many tears
Ah I suffered through the years and shed so many tears
Lord I lost so many peers and shed so many tears
Now that Im strugglin in this business by any means
Label me greedy gettin green but seldom seen
And fuck the world cause Im cursed Im havin visions
Of leavin here in a hearse God can you feel me
Take me away from all the pressure and all the pain
Show me some happiness again Im goin blind
I spend my time in this cell aint livin well
I know my destiny is Hell where did I fail
My life is in denial and when I die
Baptized in eternal fire Ill shed so many tears
Lord I suffered through the years and shed so many tears
Lord I lost so many peers and shed so many tears
Now Im lost and Im weary so many tears
Im suicidal so dont stand near me
My every move is a calculated step to bring me closer
To embrace an early death now theres nothin left
There was no mercy on the streets I couldnt rest
Im barely standin bout to go to pieces screamin peace
And though my soul was deleted I couldnt see it
I had my mind full of demons tryin to break free
They planted seeds and they hatched sparkin the flame
Inside my brain like a match such a dirty game
No memories just a misery
Paintin a picture of my enemies killin me in my sleep
Will I survive til the monin to see the sun
Please Lord forgive me for my sins cause here I come
Lord I suffered through the years God and shed so many tears
God I lost so many peers and shed so many tears
Lord knows I tried been a witness to homicide
Seen drive-bys takin lives little kids die
Wonder why as I walk by
Broken-hearted as I glance at the chalk line gettin high
This aint the life for me I wanna change
But aint no future right for me Im stuck in the game
Im trapped inside a maze
See this Tanqueray influenced me to gettin crazy
Disillusioned lately Ive been really wantin babies
So I could see a part of me that wasnt always shady
Dont trust my lady cause shes a product of this poison
Im hearin noises think she fuckin all my boys cant take no more
Im fallin to the floor beggin for the Lord to let me in
To Heavens door shed so many tears
Dear God please let me in
Lord Ive lost so many years and shed so many tears
I lost so many peers and shed so many tears
Lord I suffered through the years and shed so many tears
God I lost so many peers and shed so many tearsIm up before sunrise first to hit the block

Pour some liquor on the curb for my homies that deserve it
If I wanna make a million gotta stay dealin
Kinda boomin round the way think today I make a killin
Dressin down like Im dirty but only on the block

Gettin high I think Ill die if I dont get no ends
Im in a bucket but Im ridin it like its a Benz
I hit the strip I let my music buck

Rather die makin money than live poor and legal

Some say the blacker the berry the sweeter the juice
I say the darker the flesh then the deeper the roots
I give a holler to my sisters on welfare
Tupac cares if dont nobody else care
And uh I know they like to beat ya down a lot
When you come around the block brothas clown a lot
But please dont cry dry your eyes never let up
Forgive but dont forget girl keep your head up
And when he tells you you aint nuttin dont believe him
And if he cant learn to love you you should leave him
Cause sista you dont need him
And I aint tryin to gas ya up I just call em how I see em
You know it makes me unhappy Whats that
When brothas make babies and leave a young mother to be a pappy
And since we all came from a woman
Got our name from a woman and our game from a woman
I wonder why we take from our women
Why we rape our women do we hate our women
I think its time to kill for our women
Time to heal our women be real to our women
And if we dont well have a race of babies
That will hate the ladies that make the babies
And since a man cant make one
He has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one
So will the real men get up
I know youre fed up ladies but keep your head up
Keep ya head up ooh child things are gonna get easier
Keep ya head up ooh child thingsll get brighter
Keep ya head up ooh child things are gonna get easier
Keep ya head up ooh child thingsll get brighter
Aiyyo I remember Marvin Gaye used to sing to me
He had me feelin like black was tha thing to be
And suddenly tha ghetto didnt seem so tough
And though we had it rough we always had enough
I huffed and puffed about my curfew and broke the rules
Ran with the local crew and had a smoke or two
And I realize momma really paid the price
She nearly gave her life to raise me right
And all I had to give her was my pipe dream
Of how Id rock the mic and make it to tha bright screen
Im tryin to make a dollar out of fifteen cents
Its hard to be legit and still pay your rent
And in the end it seems Im headin for tha pen
I try and find my friends but theyre blowin in the wind
Last night my buddy lost his whole family
Its gonna take the man in me to conquer this insanity
It seems tha rainll never let up
I try to keep my head up and still keep from gettin wet up
You know its funny when it rains it pours
They got money for wars but cant feed the poor
Said it aint no hope for the youth and the truth is
It aint no hope for tha future
And then they wonder why we crazy
I blame my mother for turning my brother into a crack baby
We aint meant to survive cause its a setup
And even though youre fed up
Huh ya got to keep your head up
Keep ya head up ooh child things are gonna get easier
Keep ya head up ooh child thingsll get brighter
Keep ya head up ooh child things are gonna get easier
Keep ya head up ooh child thingsll get brighter
And uh
To all the ladies havin babies on they own
I know its kinda rough and youre feelin all alone
Daddys long gone and he left you by ya lonesome
Thank the Lord for my kids even if nobody else want em
Cause I think we can make it in fact Im sure
And if you fall stand tall and comeback for more
Cause aint nothin worse than when your son
Wants to kno why his daddy dont love him no mo
You cant complain you was dealt this
Hell of a hand without a man feelin helpless
Because theres too many things for you to deal with
Dying inside but outside youre looking fearless
While the tears is rollin down your cheeks
Ya steady hopin things dont all down this week
Cause if it did you couldnt take it and dont blame me
I was given this world I didnt make it
And now my sons gettin older and older and cold
From havin the world on his shoulders
While the rich kids is drivin Benz
Im still tryin to hold on to my survivin friends
And its crazy it seems itll never let up but
Please you got to keep your head upTurn it up loud
Hahaha ahahaha hey man
You a little sucker for love right
Word up hahahahaha
I shoulda seen
you was trouble right from the starrrrt taught me so many lessons
How not to mess with broken hearts so many questions
When this began we was the perfect match perhaps
we had some problems but we workin at it and now
the arguments are gettin loud I wanna say
But I cant help from walkin out just a little way
Just take my hand and understand if you could see
I never planned to be a man it just wasnt me
But now Im searchin for commitment in other arms
I wanna shelter you from harm dont be alarmed
Your attitude was the cause you got me stressin
Soon as I open up the door with your jealous questions
Like where can I be youre killin me with your jealousy
Now my ambitions to be free
I cant breathe cause soon as I leave its like a trap
I hear you callin me to come back Im a sucka for love
Im never gonna dance again hahahaha thats right
guilty feet have got no rhythm sucka for love
though its easy to pretend
I know youre not a fool a sucka for love
Shouldve known better than to cheat a friend
and waste the chance that Ive been given a sucka for love
so Im never gonna dance again
the way I danced with you
Just when I thought I broke away and Im fellin happy
You try to trap me say you pregnant and guess who the daddy
Dont wanna fall for it but in this case what could I do So now Im back
to makin promises to you tryin to keep it true
What if Im wrong a trick to keep me on and on
Tryin to be strong and in the process keep you goin
Im bout to lose my composure Im gettin close
To packin up and leavin notes and gettin ghost
Tell me who knows a peaceful place where I can go
To clear my head Im feelin low losin control
My heart is sayin leave oh what a tangle web we weave
when we conspire to conceive and now
You gettin calls at the house guess you cheatin
Thats all I need to hear cause Im leavin Im out the do
Never no more will you see me this is the end
Cause now I know youve been cheatin Im a sucka for love
Im never gonna dance again hahahaha thats right

Shouldve known better than to cheat a friend
and waste the chance that Ive been given a sucka for love
so Im never gonna dance again
the way I danced with you
Now he left you with scars tears on your pillow and you still stay
As you sit and pray hoping the beatingsll go away
It wasnt always a hit and run relationship
It use to be love happieness and companionship
Remember when I treated you good
I moved you up to hills out the ills of the ghetto hood
Me and you a happy home when it was on
I had a love to call my own
I shoulda seen you was trouble but I was lost trapped in your eyes
Preoccupied with gettin tossed no need to lie
You had a man and I knew it you told me
Dont worry bout it we can do it now Im under pressure
Make a decision cause Im waitin when Im alone
Im on the phone havin secret conversations huh
I wanna take your misery replace it with happiness
but I need your faith in me Im a sucka for love

Got a got a
Baby
Say that one more time Brenda
Brendas
Got a baby
Baby
I hear Brendas got a baby
But Brendas barely got a brain
A damn shame the girl can hardly spell her name
Thats not our problem thats up to Brendas family
Well let me show ya how it affects the whole community
Now Brenda really never knew her moms and her dad was a
Junky went in death to his arms its sad cause I bet
Brenda doesnt even know
Just cause your in the ghetto doesnt mean you cant grow you cant grow
But oh thats a thought my own revelation
Do whatever it takes to resist the temptation
Brenda got herself a boyfriend
Her boyfriend was her cousin now lets watch the joy end
She tried to hide her pregnancy from her family
Who didnt really care to see or give a damn if she
Went out and had a church of kids
As long as when the check came they got first dibs
Now Brendas belly is gettin bigger
But no one seems to notice any change in her figure
Shes twelve years old and shes having a baby
In love with the molester whos sexing her crazy
And yet she thinks that hell be with her forever
And dreams of a world with the two of them are together
Whatever he left her and she had the baby solo
She had it on the bathroom floor and didnt know so
She didnt know what to throw away and what to keep
She wrapped the baby up and threw him in the trash heep
I guess she thought shed get away wouldnt hear the cries
She didnt realize
How much the the little baby had her eyes
Now the babys in the trash heep balling
Momma cant help her but it hurts to hear her calling
Brenda wants to run away
Momma say you makin me lose pay
The social workers here everyday
Now Brendas gotta make her own way
Cant go to her family they wont let her stay
No money no babysitter she couldnt keep a job
She tried to sell crack but end up getting robbed
So now whats next there aint nothing left to sell
So she sees sex as a way of leaving hell
Its paying the rent so she really cant complain
Prostitute found slain and Brendas her name shes got a baby

And just looked at the whole situation
Cause once you look at it
You know Really do
They dont give a fuck about us
They dont give a fuck about us
They dont give a fuck about us
If I choose to ride thuggin til the day I die
Nobody gives a fuck about us
And when I start to rise
A hero in their childrens eyes
Now they give a fuck about us
Some say niggas is hard headed cause we love to trick
Equipped with game so we bang with this thuggish shit
I see you tryin to hide hopin that nobody dont notice
You must always remember
Youre still a member of the hopeless
See youre black like me so you snap like me
When these devils try to plot trap our young black seeds
Look it cops are just as crooked as the niggas they chasin
Lookin for role models our father figures is basers
Some say they expect Illuminati take my body to sleep
Niggas at the party with they shotties just as rowdy as me
Before I fear computer chips I gotta deal with brothers flippin
I dont see no devils bleedin only black blood drippin
We can change what your mouth say
Im watchin niggas work their lives out without pay
Whatever it takes to switch places with the busters on top
Im bustin shots make the world stop
They dont give a fuck about us
Now if I choose to ride thuggin til the day I die
Nobody gives a fuck about us
But when I start to rise
A hero in their childrens eyes
Now they give a fuck about us
If I choose to ride thuggin til the day I die
Nobody gives a fuck about us
But when I start to rise
A hero in their childrens eyes
Now they give a fuck about us
Its the morning after and now all the laughter is gone
Time to reflect on what you did cause they saying you wrong
Im sure you had your reasons dawg I dont doubt you
See the simple fact of the matter is they dont give a fuck about you
Or them five mouths you forced to feed Uh-huh
Not including yourself all you want is wealth they perceive it as greed
So as you loaded up that MAC and continue to bust
I was on paper thinkin they dont give a fuck about us
Im seein it clearer hatin the picture in the mirror
They claim we inferior so why the fuck these devils fear ya
Im watchin my nation die genocide the cause
Expect a blood bath the aftermath is yalls
I told you last album we need help cause we dyin
Give us a chance help us advance cause we tryin
Ignore my whole plea watchin us in disgust
And then they beg when my guns bust
They dont give a fuck about us
Now if I choose to ride thuggin til the day I die
Nobody gives a fuck about us
But when I start to rise
A hero in their childrens eyes
Now they give a fuck about us
If I choose to ride thuggin til the day I die
Nobody gives a fuck about us
But when I start to rise
A hero in their childrens eyes
Now they give a fuck about us
Now all my homies got love for me
Down to catch a slug for me
Guaranteed to bleed deeply now thats love
Shit nobody else could give a fuck
If Im tore down from the floor down six-feet deep in the cut
What the fuck done went wrong
How long will I be mourned
When Im gone same song aint gave a fuck all along
And who am I to blame em
Just do or die through the rainin
Since they dont give a fuck I dont feel what Im sayin
Now thug niggas die but multiply in doubles
Wrapped in plastic or closed casket for our troubles
Pressed in times we busted like bubbles
With the police this nations peace sent here to run you
Now look at what this crooked world has come to
I grew up on the other side of perfect a life of hurtin
Master a hustle soon dyin certain
So I spent your time in poor and workin I see no reason
So I stay ballin season to season
Why you stuck thinkin that they give a fuck
You tell me my world is in peace but nigga youre lyin
Cause half of my niggas long gone
Buried in the dirt just for tryin
Sometimes I think my block is dyin and that is awful
To wake up to another day shit aint changed thats all fool
I wake up sweatin dreamin coughin
Seein me upside down backwards head twisted
While Im layin in the coffin
The shit comes around so often so tell me somethin
Before I take it out on the world and get to dumpin
Nigga I be so in vain go through the struggle
And Im doin the same thing you did at my age and thats hustlin
On the edge of straight bustin
Well since you dont give a fuck I be frontin
Imma drink my Hennessy like it aint nothin
Now if I choose to ride thuggin til the day I die
They dont gives a fuck about us
But while Im kickin rhymes
Kick it to their childrens minds
Now they give a fuck about us
They wanna see us die
They kick us every time we try
Cause they dont give a fuck about us
So while Im gettin high
Im watchin as the world goes by
Cause they dont give a fuck about us
If I choose to ride thuggin til the day I die
They dont gives a fuck about us
But while Im kickin rhymes
Kick it to their childrens minds
Now they give a fuck about us
They wanna see us die
They kick us every time we try
Cause they dont give a fuck about us
So while Im gettin high
Im watchin as the world goes by
Cause they dont give a fuck about us
Rise riseResist the temptation of the beast
Youll slip and lose your grip and forever fall asleep
The venom is contagious beware of its spell
What you thought would be heaven turns out to be hell
I wonder if she knows the devils taken off her clothes
Deep into her soul slow now hes in control
Poppas doing worse a victim of the deadly curse
Wouldnt be the first to leave the ghetto in a hearse and oh how it hurts
The children pay the biggest price
Never get the chance to grow up with a happy life
Blame it on the rock but we know thats a bunch of crap
Someones at the top supplying us with much crack
Keep them in a daze dont let them see the other way
Let em all get paid wont live to see another day
See they never got a breath of the sunshine
Now the kids addicted and only hit it one time
We are destined to be dead as a nation
Dont let it come to this resist the temptation
Gamble for your soul with the devil
You wonder how low can you go before you reach the lowest level
As everybody sits and stares
Theres no use looking in you eyes cause there isnt anybody there
And though it may make you wanna cry
Got you stealing from your family and you dont even know why
I guess you think they will understand
You feel cold cause you sold your soul to the dope-man
Now theres no turning back in fact
Its decided that would live and die for the crack
You got no friends cause you cheated them all
You feel lonely low defeated and small
No one was there when I took the wrong path
And nobody cared if I died in a blood bath
But is this my destiny
Tell the Lord they got my mind but he can have the rest of me
Cause Im ready to end it all
One bullet to the brain forgive my sins and all
I didnt mean to be a bother
A failure as a son a husband and a father
I wish I could turn back the time
Go back and let it find why I let it crack my mind
And my only explanation it came to this
Resist the temptationNigga we doin this shit from Cleveland to LA
Nigga whatever you niggas want we bringing it
Thug Luv nigga what time is it
I dont give a fuck where you lay at
Its time to slay these bitch made niggas
They aint even knowing what type of niggas we is
Where my thugs at Bone Thugs-N-Harmony
I know you niggas been waiting for this shit for a long time
Well here it is nigga here it is what you gone do with it
Well I must be close to the Armageddon
Lord You know that I wont fly that lesson

Cause theyre cornered and I want em to jump up
Id rather say that we came to shut em all down
So quick to test bullet yes declare war
Roll and Ill blow when I get the gun for the murder
Mo horror for what the did it all pause for the cause
And I fin to pull a nine or pistol little nigga
Wit mine fuck dem niggas its on
All yall fall Bizzy gettin bitches test me bless the floor
In any attempt to arrest me stress me Lord
Looking at death with the last of my breath
Follow follow my kids but dont sin in my steps
Yet the weapon is kept with the best of my secrets
Deep in the leaves Im alone nigga believe
That I can see it if needed an if you really want me in
Well let it be and get the greens and be runnnin up over Cleveland
Ha ha ha whats poppin nigga Put your motherfucking
Hand on your strap nigga we can do this like gangstas and slug it out
Or be like punks and punk it out
Pull your strap on me nigga and you better kill be thug life baby
Ill probably be punished for hard livin blind to the facts
Thugs is convicts in Gods prison hand on the strap
Praying to Father please forgive me police be rushing when they see me
I flaunted Americas most wanted live on TV life
Pleasure and pain stuck in this game holler my name
We all gone die we bleed through similar veins
Youse explain to me now dont panic when my gun burst
Heard the last jam nigga this ones worse
My nigga bone held the chrome till I came home
Thug Luv playas tell these bitch niggas bring it on
I caught a plane out to Cleveland late last evening
To help my niggas clean up some niggas no longer breathing now
Who you believe in hit the weed and breathe its a
Cold ass the world them niggas kill you in your sleep
Until they stop me bury murder me or drop me
I got Thug Luv for my nationwide posse feel me
Little thug from the land nigga never ran
Motherfuckers out to get me they dont understand
Its the number one nigga out with a nation of niggas
Down to put in some work do some dirt
Fuckin round with the band Bone Thugs-N-Harmony
Follow down the road we stroll to meet karma
Everything I do it seem to cause drama
Ready for the war like a knight in my armor bomb ya
So quick to test us nigga wanna crash me eat dust
For the love of the lust niggas bustin on us
Hit em up with he buck twelve gauge erupt
Its the Art Of War putting niggas on the floor
When Im comin through the door
Bringin nothin but terror
Causing much to the nigga that dared us
Trying to put a twist in this thugsta era
Paired up with a nigga like Pac
And a nigga like me gotta stay high
Thug Luv till I die keep my prayer to the sky
But Im still in the hood smoke and fry
So I beg the Lord to save us all escapers of misery
Bless my niggas in penitentiaries soldiers of the century
Here to get it told my niggas to get the hell down
Down with the dirt and we dont fuck around
Buck a couple of rounds and if youre passing
Through then hit the ground
And dont get caught up in the crossfire nigga
Artillery thick and you dont want to get to fuckin with this
Im straight devil devil not a punk and pretend
I reload buck a little more flee the scene
Fore the po-po even know what you lookin for
They dont know a motherfucker with a Leatherface hey
Man she said I ran this way said I ran that way
You hoesll never know because I got away yeah
A criminal mind a nigga on the level sometimes

Reminiscin needin tissues fightin over childish issues

Nigga still tired so Im yawnin and now Im gone
Tryin to get my money on strong so an early riser
Out befo them other guys thats the way to profit every time
Cant get too close my enemies they see ghosts they envy me
Plus we been beefin with the East coast with casualites
Got stopped in traffic had a warrant so they gaffled me
But while Im gone watch my business and my back for me
My enemies think they got me crossed they aint knowin

Keep yo head up cause things are gettin better
My cellmates shed tears off yo last love letter

Sorry if I cuss but its the suffering that I feel
Who can I trust and if I bust will she snitch
Even though you aint the type to trip
Sorry if I called you bitch
You showed me the definition of feminine
The difference between a pack of bitches and black women

We came way too far pretty baby
To throw it all away throw it all away
I swear Ill never call you bitch again heyYou know they got me trapped in this prison of seclusion
Happiness living on the streets is a delusion
Even a smooth criminal one day must get caught
Shot up or shot down with the bullet that he bought
Nine millimeter kickin thinking about what the streets do to me
Cause they never talk peace in the black community
All we know is violence do the job in silence
Walk the city streets like a rat pack of tyrants
Too many brothers daily heading for the big pen
Niggas commin out worse off then when they went in
Over the years I done a lot of growin up
Gettin drunk thrown up
Cuffed up
Then I said I had enough
There must be another route way out
To money and fame I changed my name
And played a different game
Tired of being trapped in this vicious cycle
If one more cop harassed me I just might go psycho
And when I get em
Ill hit em with the bum rush
Only a lunatic would like to see his skull crushed
Yo if your smart youll really let me go G
But keep me cooped up in this ghetto and catch the Uzi
They got me trapped
Uh uh they cant keep the black man down
They got me trapped
Naw they cant keep the black man down
Trapped
Uh uh they cant keep the black man down
Trapped
Naw they cant keep the black man down
They got me trapped
Can barely walk the city streets
Without a cop harassing me searching me
Then asking my identity
Hands up throw me up against the wall
Didnt do a thing at all
Im tellin you one day these suckers gotta fall
Cuffed up throw me on the concrete
Coppers try to kill me
But they didnt know this was the wrong street
Bang bang down another casualty
But its a cop whos shot theres brutality
Who do you blame
Its a shame because the mans slain
He got caught in the chains of his own game
How can I feel guilty after all the things they did to me
Sweated me hunted me
Trapped in my own community
One day Im gonna bust
Blow up on this society
Why did ya lie to me
I couldnt find a trace of equality
Work me like a slave while they laid back
Homie dont play that
Its time I lett em suffer the payback
Im tryin to avoid physical contact
I cant hold back its time to attack jack
They got me trapped
Uh uh they cant keep the black man down
They got me trapped
Naw they cant keep the black man down
Trapped
Uh uh they cant keep the black man down
Trapped
Naw they cant keep the black man down
Now Im trapped and want to find a getaway
All I need is a G and somewhere safe to stay
Cant use the phone
Cause Im sure someone is tappin in
Did it before
Aint scared to use my gat again
I look back at hindsight the fight was irrelevant
But now hes the devils friend
Too late to be tellin him
He shot first and Ill be damned if I run away
Homie is done away I should of put my gun away
I wasnt thinkin all I heard was the ridicule
Girlies was laughin Tup sayin Damn homies is dissin you
I fired my weapon
Started steppin in the hurricane
I got shot so I dropped
Feelin a burst of pain
Got to my feet
Couldnt see nothin but bloody blood
Now Im a fugitive to be hunted like a murderer
Ran through an alley
Still lookin for my getaway
Coppers said Freeze or youll be dead today
Trapped in a corner
Dark and I couldnt see the light
Thoughts in my mind was the nine and a better life
What do I do
Live my life in a prison cell
Id rather die then be trapped in a living hell
They got me trapped
Uh uh they cant keep the black man down
They got me trapped
Naw they cant keep the black man down
Trapped
Uh uh they cant keep the black man down
You know they got me trapped
Naw they cant keep the black man down

niggas need a spot where we can kick it
A spot where we belong thats just for us
niggas aint gotta get all dressed up and be Hollywood
Yknahmean Where do niggas go when we die
Aint no heaven for a thug nigga
Thats why we go to thug mansion
Thats the only place where thugs get in free and you gotta be a G
At thug mansion
A place to spend my quiet nights time to unwind
So much pressure in this life of mine
I cry at times I once contemplated suicide
and woulda tried but when I held that nine all I could see was my mommas eyes
No one knows my struggle they only see the trouble
Not knowin its hard to carry on when no one loves you
Picture me inside the misery of poverty
No man alive has ever witnessed struggles I survived
Prayin hard for better days promise to hold on
Me and my dawgs aint have a choice but to roll on
We found a family spot to kick it
Where we can drink liquor store and no one bickers over trick shit
A spot where we can smoke in peace and even though we Gs
We still visualize places that we can roll in peace
And in my minds eye I see this place the players go in fast
I got a spot for us all so we can ball at thugs mansion
Aint no place Id rather be
Chilren dead homies and family
Sky high iced out paradise in the sky
Aint no place Id rather be
Only place thats right for me
Chromed out mansion in paradise in the sky
Will I survive all the fights and the darkness
Trouble sparks they tell me home is where the heart is dear departed
I shed tattooed tears and couldnt sleep good
For multiple years witness peers catch gunshots
Nobody cares seen the politicians ban us
Theyd rather see us locked in chains please explain
Why they cant stand us is there a way for me to change
Or am I just a victim of things I did to maintain
I need a place to rest my head
With the little bit of homeboys that remains cause all the rest dead
Is there a spot for us to roll if you find it
Ill be right behind ya show me and Ill go
How can I be peaceful Im comin from the bottom
Watch my daddy scream peace while the other man shot him
I need a house thats full of love when I need to escape
The deadly places slingin drugs in thugs mansion
Aint no place Id rather be
Chilren dead homies and family
Sky high iced out paradise in the sky
Aint no place Id rather be
Only place thats right for me
Chromed out mansion in paradise in the sky
Dear momma dont cry your baby boys doin good
Tell the homies Im in heaven and they aint got hoods
Seen a show with Marvin Gaye last night
it had me shook drippin peppermint Schnapps with Jackie Wilson and Sam Cooke
Then some lady named Billie Holiday sang sittin there kickin it with Malcolm til the day came
Little LaTasha sho grown tell the lady in the liquor that shes forgiven so come home
Maybe in time youll understand only God can save us
When Miles Davis cuttin lose with the band
Just think of all the people that you knew in the past
That passed on they in heaven found peace at last
Picture a place that they exist together
There has to be a place better than this in heaven
So right before I sleep dear God what Im askin
Remember this face save me a place in thugs mansion
Aint no place Id rather be
Chilren dead homies and family
Sky high iced out paradise in the sky
Aint no place Id rather be
Only place thats right for me
Chromed out mansion in paradise in the sky
Aint no place Id rather be
Chilren dead homies and family
Sky high iced out paradise in the sky
Aint no place Id rather be
Only place thats right for me

You see you wouldnt ask why the rose that grew from the concrete
had damaged petals On the contrary we would all celebrate its
tenacity We would all love its will to reach the sun
Well we are the rose - this is the concrete - and these are
my damaged petals Dont ask me why thank God nigga ask me how
HahahahaNiggas Yeah Uh

Whos afraid of the punk police
Niggas run the streets no justice no peace
Fuck the law rather draw than do time
Dont fuck with mine cross the line my two nines
Go baya baya when I shoot em
Korean mothafuckers was crooked so niggas had to burn and loot em
Now the streets aint safe at night
My Niggas Straight take his life
So dont sleep when my Jeep creep up how we hit em
Empty the clip then dip cause we did em
Lickin of shots for Latasha thats proper
Love for my niggas but a glock for the coppers
So what the fuck you want to do now
I packed a nine last year in ninety-nine Im packin two now
And even if they pull their triggers
They can shoot one man
But nothings gonna stop the plan of true niggas
Niggas Yeah niggas you cant fuck with us
Niggas Cause bein a nigga means you love niggas
Niggas Jada ey yo

Niggas nowawadays they worry me my bars is therapy
As long as you usin them thoroughly
Muah til the day that they bury me
My niggas is stronger and tighter
Now than they probably will ever be
And Im a product of the seventys
The hood got niggas on punishment
Thats why they never leave
If I aint eatin with you Im probably beefin with you
If no money aint involved aint
No need for me speakin with you
I know you got a gun but Im hopin you keep it with you
cause unfortunately Im one of them rappers that keep a pistol and
You know what the llama do ShadyAftermath Ruff Ryders
D-Block and of course Amaru
Lotta people honor you probably cause of the way you used to bring the drama to
Whoever you wanted to
You a leader when you can get a leader to follow you
But anyway life goes on
So Ill see you when I art in heaven like our fathers doChorus

Started off with runnin from copses duck and hide from helicopters
We open fire who can stop us
Livin the life of trife juveniles hopin for righteous
Gettin twenty-five to life if the judge dont like us
In my clearest pictures I see authorities itchin to get us
ATF state feds scandalous bitches
I wasnt promised to it wasnt bitter or sweet
See if a nigga dont hustle then the nigga dont eat
Only streets livin do or die circle complete
Repetitive motions and felons in the rush for cheese
Please understand my history a man of many acts
Livin Thug Life comin equipped with many gats
Maybe I was just a Lost Soul trapped in time
Livin in between life and the cracks were blind
Even though we had hope for dreams that never came
Yet and still we all feel pain

He taught me the rules so much but still In Thugs I Trust
When in danger never hesitate to keep my fuckin trap shut

The Devil loves sinners crackheads and drug dealer
Sometimes I feel like the streets are takin over
Never stayin sober the brain over and over backtrack
My stacks fat I used to take new

Idi Amin
I was born twenty-two years ago yesterday
But see I saw no reason for me to celebrate let me demonstrate
Entered the world from out a poisonous womb
Heroin bein consumed already predicitin my doom soon
to be one of the many misguided
Always the first one on the block to be done tried it and liked it
Lost before I had a chance to find my way
Now I travel through life not knowin the time of day
thug niggas screamin Westside bustin double glocksDear mama Im caught up in this sickness
I robbed my adversaries but slipped and left a witness
Wonder if theyll catch me or will this nigga snitch
Should I shoot his bitch or make the nigga rich
Dont wanna commit murder but damn they got me trapped
Hawkin while Im walkin and talkin behind my back
Im kind of schizophrenic Im in this shit to win it
Cause lifes a Wheel of Fortune heres my chance to spin it
Got no time for cops who trip and try to catch me
Too fuckin trigger happy to let them suckers snatch me
Niggaz gettin jealous jealous tryin to find my stash
Whip out the nine now Ima dive and pump your ass
Peter picked a pepper but I can pick a punk
Snatched him like a bitch and threw him in the trunk
The punk thought I was bluffin but swear Im nothin nice
Before I take your life first wrestle with these mics
I listen to him scream Tray Deee went insane
I guess the little mites had finally found his brain
New Rovers pull me over Im sentenced to the pen
Remember that little bird he snitched and told a friend
Its trouble on my mind Im with the old timers
And fuck five-oh blaow blaow
Dear mama they sentenced me to death
Todays my final day Im countin every breath
Im bitter cause Im dyin so much I havent seen
I know you never dreamed your baby would be dead at sixteen
I got beef with a sick society that doesnt give a shit
And they too quick to say goodbye to me
They tell me the preachers there for me
Hes a crook with a book that motherfucker never cared for me
Hes only here to be sure
I dont drop a dime to God bout the crimes hes commitin
on the poor and how can these people judge me
They aint my peers and in all these years they aint never love me
I never got to be a man must be part of some big plan
to keep a nigga in the state pen
And to my homies out buryin motherfuckers
Steer clear of these Aryan motherfuckers
Cause once they got you locked up
They got you trapped youre better off gettin shot up
Im convinced self-defense is the way
Please stay strapped pack a gat every day
I wish I woulda known while I was out there
Now Im straight headin for the chair
Dear mama these cops dont understand me
I turned to a life of crime cause I came from a broken family
My uncle used to touch me I never told you that
Scared what you might do I couldnt hold you back
I kept it deep inside I done let it fuel my anger
Im down for all my homies no mercy for a stranger
The brother in my cell is sixteen as well
Its hard to adapt when youre black and youre trapped in a livin Hell
I shouldnta let him catch me
Instead of livin sad in jail I coulda died free and happy
And my cellmates raped on the norm
And passed around the dorm you can hear his asshole gettin torn
They made me an animal
Cant sleep instead of countin sheep niggaz countin cannibals
And thats how it is in the pen
Turn old and cold and your soul is your best friend
My mama prayed for me
Tell the Lord to make way for me prepare any day for me why
Cause when they come for me they find a struggler
To the death I take the breath from your jugular
The trick is to never lose hope
I found my buddy hangin dead from a ropeIf They Love Their Kidz
If my enemies love their kids
only if my enemies love their kids
If my enemies love their kids
If my enemies love their kids
only if my enemies love their kids
Hey why have drama

I could touch her if I fucking wanna
so why you want insist on this
I got your name at the top of fucking dead bitch list

tonight Im bussin off the terrace with multiple gun shots
niggas be droppin rapidly bussin clip to cops

and then we buss shots from glocks fuck cops
my only fear of death can you hear me its coming back

Bang with the outlaw click six since I came out pull out my pistol

Dealing with everybody running off they get the gas smack cracks out my gun ball
Holes in your body and blood all over your clothes
Cause money makes Earth what its working hurt
Doing dirt they spit it you can borrow I mean it
Any confrontation on currency stacking while Im acting all low

Cop ready to blow your block off the map
Thug life nigger live with us cops trying to get us but they cant

Niggers play us getting paper is a blackjack

Well its to all you are we untouchable bringing the rockers to all you
But now we play as far as we play

Many different ways
Fuck with outlaws is crazy they cut like who is it the shot get down

Thats gonna make it hard to smile in the future
No Doubt
But whatever you see through all the rain and pain
You gotta keep a sense of humor
Gotta be able to smile through all this bullshit
Remember that
Just keep ya head up
Our lifesytles be close caption
Addicted to fatal attraction
Pictures and actions be played back
In the mist of mashin
No fairytales for this young black male
Some see me stranded in this land of Hell
Jail and crack cells
culture
Or the repercussion
While bustin on back-stabbing vultures
Sellin my soul
For material wishes
Fast cars and bitches
Wishin I live my life a legend
Immortalized in pictures
Why shed tears save your sympathy
My childhood years
Was spend burying my peers in the cemetery
Heres a message to the newborns
Waiting to breath
If you believe
you can achieve just look at me
Against all odds
Though life is hard we carry on
Living in the projects
Broke with no lights on
To all the Gs that follow me
Protect your essence
Born with less but your still precious
Just smile for me now
Oh Wont you smile for me
Just smile for me now
Oh Wont you smile for me
Nigga you black smile for me now
Oh Wont you smile for me
You aint got nothin to worry about
Smile for me now
Oh Wont you smile for me
And the next generation
Now as I open up my story
With the blaze of your blunt
So you can picture thoughts slowly
Upon phrases I run
And I can walk you through the dayz that it done
I often wish that I can save everyone
But Im a dreamer
Have you ever seen a nigga
Who was strong in the game
Over-looking his tomorrows
and they finally came
Look back on childhood memories
And Im still feelin the pain
Turnin circles in my nineth grade
Dealin Cocaine
To many hassels in my local lights
Survivin the strain
And a man without a focused life
could drive him insane
Stuck inside a getto fantasy
Hopin itd change
But were not focused on reality
We broken in Jane
Had a dream of livin wealthy
Makin it big
Over football

What take it
He did
And after all my mamas thankin god
For blessing her child
All my mama gotz to do now is collect

Fuck tha world
As we unload we witness furious speeds
Un-answered questions keep us all stressin
Curious Gs
Back stabed and bleeding
Crooked thoughs
Laced with weed
Learnin duckin stray shots
Bullets be hot
They burnin
Inhale the shurm smoke
Visualize the flames
Will I be smothered by my own pain
Strange wisdoms
Cowards conversate
So quick to dis us
Takin pictures for the Feds
In desperate hopes they get us
Hit us all give us plenty centuries
Forgive my stance
Sense I entered many penitentiaries
The best revenge
Is fuck friends
We milatary minded soljahs
Bustin shots blindly
Trying to find Jahova
To help me
Somebody save me
Lost and crazy
Scared to drop a seed
Hopin I aint cursed babies
Maybe now
Niggaz feel me now
Picture my pain
Embrace my words
Make the world change
And still I smile nigga
Oh Wont you smile for me
Just smile for me now
Oh Wont you smile for me
Nigga you black smile for me now
Oh Wont you smile for me
You aint got nothin to worry about
Smile for me now
Oh Wont you smile for me
And the next generationsome for us people start to make some
Lets change the way we eat
Lets change things the way we live
Lets change the way we treat you
You see the all way wasnt working
We got children to survive
Nothing more conscious person at all
Theres was something going on my backyard in my
So I had to kill him off
Now I love God but God aint push
So how can you start a button when you push
and guns
On my hood feel with the God in sons
divine it I got prices and of free
You dont seem like it
Somebody feel like I do so folks than American Idol

Yall remember me

Bury me in pieces cause they fear reincarnation
Niggas screaming peace cause they fear when my squad face em
Take them to places stake they face then erase em and brake em
Murder motherfuckers at a rate and then quicken the pace
Blast me but never ask me to live a lie
Am I wrong cause I wanna get it on till I die
Now even if you blind you still see my prophecy
My destiny to overthrow those on top of me
Bitch made niggas and that bullshit you go through
Outlawz busting busting we untouchable
Am I wrong cause I wanna get it on till I die

Get it on till I die get it on till I die

Promises you made before you got elected they aint came true
Tell me what to do these niggaz actin up in the hood
Send mo troops dear Mr President
Tell me what to do these niggaz actin up in the hood
Send mo troops
Why should I lie when I can dramatize
Niggaz fell victim to my lyrics now traumatized
Simply by spittin Ive been blessed given riches
Enemies suspicious cause Im seldom in the company of bitches
Plus the concepts I depict so visual that you can kiss
Each and every trick or bitch inside the shit I kick
My heaviest versell move a mountain
Casualties in mass amounts brothers keep countin
Fuck the friendships I ride alone
Destination Death Row finally found a home
Plus all my homies wanna die call it euthanasia
Dear Lord look how sick this ghetto made us sincerely
Yours Im a thug the product of a broken home
Everybodys doped up nigga what you smokin on
Figure if we high they can train us
But then America fucked up and blamed up
I guess its cause we black that we targets
My only fear is God I spit that hard shit
In case you dont know I let my pump go
Get ride for MThulu like I ride for Geronimo
Down to die for everything I represent
Meant every word in my letter to the President
Dear Mr President tell me what to do
These niggaz actin up in the hood send mo troops
Dear Mr President tell me what to do
These niggaz actin up in the hood send mo troops
Oh youse a ball in the White House I hope you comfortable
Cause yo I spend my nights out with the lights out
Under the safety of darkness amongst the crazed and the heartless
And young soul bros ready to rode a starship
Launch it leave a nigga flat for scratch the Godless
I gotta get chips but you cant understand that
Wanna ban rap Stand back before you get hurt
Its the only thing makin pay besides smoke and work
On a mission listen more chips my goal and position
First on my decision I realized the same nigga
Trippin to drastic measures tryin to get stacks of cheddar
Muhfuckers hate cops wait it aint gettin better
But you keep tellin us that it is
While your motherfuckin troops keep killin our kids dig
Dont be surprised if you see us
Dumpin with nuttin but artillery to free us motherfucker
Dear Mr President tell us what to do
These niggaz actin up in the hood send mo troops
Dear Mr President tell me what to do
These niggaz actin up in the hood send mo troops
Strapped and angry with no hope and heartbroke
Fightin first my trained brain until its not so
Its hostile niggaz lick shots to watch the glocks glow
Cadres of coppers patrol us like we some animals
And it aint no peace my peace a piece on my streets
To people beefin and things squeakin on they beefs for weeks
Mr President its evident nobody really care
For a struggle out the gutter twenty-two with gray hair
I was raised to raise hell frail and my heart stale
So Ima bring hell to earth until my heart fail
But yall play fair give me and mine Ill share
Til yall show us you care its gon be mayhem out here
Me and these two hundred and twenty-threesll freeze the biggest with ease
Im still a nigga you fear bring the beast to his knees
And Ive been born to represent for that Ive been heaven sent
And I meant every word in my letter to the President
Shit is still fucked up yall
And yall wonder when its gon get better
And it aint gon get better
Dear Mr President tell me what to do
These niggaz actin up in the hood send mo troops
Dear Mr President tell me what to do
These niggaz actin up
Heavenly Father may I holla at you briefly
I wanna meet the President but will he meet me
Hes scared to look inside the eyes of a Thug Nigga
We tired of bein scapegoats for this capitalistic drug dealin
How hypocritical is Liberty
That blind bitch aint never did shit for me
My history full of casket and scars
My own black nation at war whole family behind bars
And they wonder why we scarred thirteen lookin hard
Sister had a baby as an adolescent where was God
Somewhere in the middle of my mind
Is a nigga on the tightrope screamin let him die
Cant lie Im a thug drownin in my own blood
Lookin for the reason that my mommas strung out on drugs
Down to die for everything I represent
Meant every word in my letter to the President
Blacks is broke think its a joke that we livin low
Yall sniffin blow and postin what they hittin fo
Tell the secretary its necessary we get paid
Look what you made little kids gettin sprayed
Day after day and night after night battles and wars to the daylight
We might change and rearrange if you do somethin
Til then we gonna keep it comin Mr President
And I meant every word in my letter to the President

So I know anybody can be touched
You know what I mean
Oh God forgive me
Somebody please say a prayer for me
Needed my parents
But they was never there for me
Believe in everything they feed me
Im seeing demons
I wake up screaming
Who believe me or was I dreaming
Five fingers on the forty-five chrome
Dead aim at my brain infrared with no lights on
I aint afraid to die I want to see whats after this
Im living blind writing rhymes
Til they capture this
And if we die let the world understand why
Soldier my eyes hate to see a young thug cry
They seeing us inside a casket
Thats how they see us
Oh God forgive us ghetto bastards
We human beings
They leaving us inside this hell-hole
Just waiting to fail so they tell us

And when its my time to go

I was born in the city that never sleeps
Schooled by the realest of the real ns
That ever breathed
And I was big when I was young
And now I see that I was dumb
My n Lonnie just got hit with ten ten years
For trusting a friend
They left him stuck in the Penn
I love him we all here just to die here plus
Nobody cares what got here
Touched by a angel and kissed by the Lord
Praise the thug ways and Ill never be bored
Touched by a angel and kissed by the Lord

Share between clients and homies
Remember what Patcino told me
Before he past
Watch them clowns with them crocodile smiles
Cause they phony I get that cash stay lonely
And Im point like a thong
And its survive for the strong
Living outside the laws of this crooked world
I was born touched

Too in a rush ns better slow down

Slightly disillusioned by weed

When I bleed my enemies best to flee quickly on me
My army nz decieve swiftly
Look at you now why you want to hang out
I pull the hammer back
Strike wit a cannon and blow your muthafin back out
They blast but Im still standin
Slightly scarred deep
Questions for the lord why he dont like me guard my soul
Though my life was hard with no remorse
I absorb bomb less its without protection for the boss
Rollin in my double raw rugged and ruthless
Keep a vest through these hard times knowin its useless
And my crew who could should be mistaken for Jews
We all about our past blast if he break the rules
Fools done snitched for the DA be heavensent
Switched like a stone-b turned streight severed then why
Then they wonder why nz die
Put your family in danger just to get high

Buncha toy souljahs all dressed in fatigue
But Im Edi Amin on a mission to make em bleed
Nigga what Nigga who
It was cool and at you what the fuck is gone do
Barbecue and boo-hoo
Ride or die get money all at the same time
Split the pie with the homie ball at the same time
Any nigga splippin fall at the same time
We all links in the chain tryin to gain do time
We all see the sunshine
But when you could do yourz well bring these muthafuckas war
You either ride wit us or collide wit us
Its as simple as that for me and my niggaz
As I approach the scene from smokin green
Got my eyes closed niggaz so cold on my foes
I make em die froze
Watch me make em bleed make em Gs
Lord help me witit
Got me paintin pictures of a mil-ticket
Help me getit
See me and pray for options
But the pressures nonstop
Niggaz get the pistol poppin
And watch they body drop
Im a lethal threat watch me hit your set
Flash on blast on them bitch-made niggaz wit my mask on
Do it for profit plus Im lookin for punks to bust on
If you aint screamin WestSide you can get the fuck on
Im seein demons hittin weed
Got me hearin screamin
Scared to go to sleep watch the scene like a dope-fiend
Probably be punished for it though you cant ignore it
I live the life of a thug nigga and die for it
Niggaz pass the clip and watch me bring em to the floor
I got some shit that they aint ready for What you got
I got the Secretz of War
You either ride wit us or collide wit us
Its as simple as that for me and my niggaz
We do this thug life shit like four five six dick em
Down wit no rounds left up in the pound when the sounds Here we go
Squeeze the lead off I blow his mutha fuckin head off
Signal all the other outlawz to get this shit set off
Yaki Kadafi it aint a cop here to stop me
These streetz is black hockey and raw we get sloppy
Put a pamper on your silly ass prestyle grammar
Locked in the slammer while Im laid cocked back like a hammer
Yall newly weds that in honey moons times bout up
Yall that means I leave no trace found with you face bounce stuck
Your pig scanners cant come close touch or even hit me
Doin my dirt puttin in work you see shit what you gonna do
You either ride wit us or collide wit us

Blunts I twist em fuck the whole world

You got some heat Pull it out
Cock the hammer if you wit it dont make
No difference here with the twenty-five to life sentence
We already doin life on the streetz
Like algae niggaz be heated when they walkin the beat
This shit is flaky makin backs shaky niggaz hate me
Scared to face me knowin that the Outlawz blaze me
Pull me up on game put me up on a hustle
Once I suck my money muscle all the Gs got devils
Movin shit like a dollar beatin niggaz like Rodney
Turn a killa like Kadafi and a nuke stream to stop me
You either ride wit us or collide wit us
Its as simple as that for me and my niggaz
Bring it on
And all you lil young ass souljahs
You play this shit back about fifteen times
Youll have enough game to roll up in a club or somethin
Teach these bitches a lil somethin you know what I mean
Secretz of muthafuckin WarDear Lord
As we down here struggle for as long as we know
In search of a paradise to touch my nigga Johnny J
Dreams are dreams and reality seems to be the only place to go
The only place for us
I know try to make the best of bad situations
Seems to be my lifes story
Aint no glory in pain a soldiers story in vain
And cant nobody live this life for me
Its a ride yall a long hard ride
Somebody break me Im dreamin I started as a seed the semen
Swimmin upstream planted in the womb while screamin
on the top was my pops my momma screamin stop
From a single drop this is what they got
Not to disrespect my peoples but my poppa was a loser
Only plan he had for momma was to fuck her and abuse her
Even as a little seed I could see his plan for me
Stranded on welfare another broken family
Now what was I to be a product of this heated passion
Momma got pregnant and poppa got a piece of ass
Look how it began nobody gave a fuck about me
Pistol in my hand this cruel world can do without me
How can I survive Got me askin white Jesus
will a nigga live or die cause the Lord cant see us
in the deep dark clouds of the projects aint no sunshine
No sunny days and we only play sometimes
When everybodys sleepin
I open my window jump to the streets and get to creepin
I can live or die hope I get some money fore Im gone
Im only nineteen Im tryin to hustle on my own
on the spot where everybody and they pops tryin to slang rocks
Id rather go to college but this is where the game stops
Dont get it wrong cause its always on from dusk to dawn
You can buy rocks glocks or a herringbone
You can ask my man Ishmael Reed
Keep my nine heated all the time this is how we grind
Meet up at the cemetery then get smoked out pass the weed nigga
That Hennesseyll keep me keyed nigga
Everywhere I go niggas holla at me Keep it real G
And my reply til they kill me
Act up if you feel me I was born not to make it but I did
The tribulations of a ghetto kid still I rise
Still I still I I rise I rise
Please give me to the sky the sky
And if and if I die I die
I dont want you to cry
I stay sharp as always
Runnin ya bricks with blitz through ya project hallways
Dumpin crews like twos nigga all day
Secrets of war prepare me for the worst
A life thats lavish full of cabbage or a life thats in a hearse
But now my dreams it seems though be placin triple beams and things bro
Diamond pinkie ring got the loot poppin out my jeans
Now I plan to keep my glock cocked
If trouble was searchin for me then why not
Show em what Im made of plus raised on on my block
Chancellor Ave where many turn to the street thugs snatchin bags
We out for power makin cash it wasnt fast itll make me mad
Im just like pimpin
My homey on the corner with his gat tucked in
Youngest they buckin somethin the life he leads
the life he dont need dont we all know
He tryin to rise up and we just go doe still he rise
Dreams of lost hope
I hit the strip broke where the fiends get coke
and still I rise now I float cowards ghost
Whenever we come around Im runnin down
clutchin a pound live as sirens duckin the sound
I used to hustle with my moms til the sun came
My homey Harm doin time from this drug game
Stolen cars war scars born a Outlaw
Behind bars go to sleep just to see the stars
Freedom is ours though we trapped on a firm block
Crackheads only ten learn to duck cops
In ninety-six my glocks my plastic passion for blastin bastards
No faces for open caskets peelin ya cap backwards
Ya cowards aint prepared for pistol practice
I send my missiles through your mattress
Leavin holes in your body like a cactus
While me and my crew be boppin more greens than topic
and loot to keep the seams in my motherfuckin jeans poppin
Leavin ya spleen to pick up
Half of you niggas is softer than a Snicker
Lets go to war and see who draw quicker
and still I rise and still I rise
Still I still I I rise I rise
Please give me to the sky the sky
And if and if I die I die
I dont want you to cry
Still I still I I rise I rise
Please give me to the sky the sky
And if and if I die I die
I dont want you to cry
Yall niggas fake
All day everyday
So now I got roller blades bitch
Thought you knew
Your mouth is rich
Cmon pops lets goSearching for Black Jesus oh yeah
Sportin jewels and shit you know what I mean
Straight tatted up no doubt no doubt
Young Kadafi in this bitch set it off nigga what
I do my shootins on a knob prayin to God for my squad
Stuck in a nightmare hopin he might care
Though times is hard up against all odds I play my cards
Like Im jailin shots hittin up my spot like midnight rains hailin
Got me bailin to stacks more green
Gods aint tryin to be trapped on no block slangin
No rocks like bean pies brainstorm on the beginnin
Wonder how shit like the Quran and the Bible was written
What is religion Gods words all cursed like crack
Shaitans way of gettin us back or just another
One of my Black Jesus traps
Whos got the heart to stand beside me
I feel my enemies creepin up in silence
Dark prayer scream violence demons all around me
Cant even bend my knees just a lost cloud Black Jesus
Give me a reason to survive in this earthly hell
Cause I swear they tryin to break my well
Im on the edge lookin down at this volatile pit
Will it matter if I cease to exist Black Jesus
All hail the pressure no endeavor can fail
Some missin souls turn to hoes when exposed to jail
In times of war we need somebody raw rally the troops
Like a Saint that we can trust to help to carry us through
Black Jesus ha ha ha ha ha
Hes like a Saint that we can trust to help to carry us through
Black Jesus
Outlawz we got our own race culture religion
Rebellin against the system commence to lynchin
The President aint even listenin to the pain of the youth
We make music for eternity forever the truth
Political prisoner the two choices that they givin us
Ride or die for life they sentence us
Oh Black Jesus please watch over my brother Shawn
Soon as the sky get bright its just another storm
Brothers gone now labeled a statistic
Aint no love for us ghetto kids they call us nigglets
History repeats itself nuttin new in school I knew
Erything I read wasnt true Black Jesus
To this click Im dedicated criminal orientated
An Outlaw initiated blazed and faded
Made for terror major league niggaz pray together
Bitches in they grave while my real niggaz play together
We die clutchin glasses filled with liquor bomblastic
Cremated last wishes nigga smoke my ashes
High sigh why die wishin hopin for possibilities
Ill mob on why they copy me sloppily
Cops patrol projects hatin the people livin in them
I was born an inmate waitin to escape the prison
Went to church but dont understand it they underhanded
God gave me these commandments the world is scandalous
Blast til they holy high baptize they evil minds
Wise no longer blinded watch me shine trick
Which one of yall wanna feel the degrees
Bitches freeze facin Black Jesus
All hail the pressure no endeavor can fail
Some missin souls turn to hoes when exposed to jail
In times of war we need somebody raw rally the troops
Like a Saint that we can trust to help to carry us through
Black Jesus
Some say some day some how some way we gon fail
And it aint hard to tell we dwell in hell
Trapped black scarred and barred
Searching for truth where its hard to find God
I play the Pied Piper and to this Thug Life Im a lifer
Proceed to turn up the speed just for stripes
My Black Jesus walk through this valley with me
Where we so used to hard times and casualties
Indeed it hurt me deep to have to sleep on the streets
And havent eaten in weeks so save a prayer for me
And all the young thugs raised on drugs and guns
Blazed out and numb slaves to this slums this aint livin Jesus
We believed in You everything You do
Just wanna let you know how we feel
Black Jesus
Searchin for Black Jesus
Its hard its hard we need help out here
So we searchins for Black Jesus
Its like a Saint that we pray to in the ghetto to get us through
Somebody that understand our pain
You know maybe not too perfect you know
Somebody that hurt like we hurt
Somebody that smoke like we smoke
Drink like we drink
That understand where we coming from
Thats who we pray to we need help yallThese is hard times we livin in go down
Churches burnin planes fallin from the sky
Murder the good die young
Good definitely die young this is a lil somethin
To help you get through the day if you could
It was more than a tragedy
Emotions be grabbin me
Plane fell from the sky
We tryin to figure what happened
Burnin churches fearin God
Who can be so cruel
We all ignorant to AIDS
Till it happens to you
Just be a man make plans
Listen to your voice
A womans tryin to make decisions
We should leave them a choice
Cause who are we to say
Who lives and die breathes and stops
All this judgment on other lives
Needs to stop
What are we livin for
Givin more back than takin
On my knees still waitin
For my own salvation
Now I feel abandoned
Cause Pat Buchanan say Im greedy
You can take my taxes send me to war
But cant feed me
Its so easy to regret things
After they done
Babies catchin murder cases
Scared to laugh in the sun
The tragedies that we all need
Love in doses
In times like these we feel closest
The good die young
Does anybody have an answer why
It seems the good die young
Can anybody tell me why
Can anybody tell me why
Does anybody have an answer why
It seems the good die young
Can anybody tell me why
Can anybody tell me why
Now in my world will it get worse
When I been trapped since birth
But I had to sleep in a hearse
Cause it was my bed first
My grands probably burnin
Turnin in they grave
Some folks aint even get to see a high age
But they did so I aint afraid
And this money got me feelin like a star
And this murder got me
Feelin like my death aint far
And the land and stolen cars
Dont get no better
Dont get no weaker or no harder
I was raised in a rush without my moms
And my father
So tell me somethin
If I grab my gat and get the dumpin
Would God get to lookin at me funny
Rest in peace to my mother Aquillah Beale
Rest in peace to my father Salek Beale
Rest in peace to my grandparents
And thug in peace to my brother Seike
You know I love you
Witch world first storms and then Al
Pac and then Yak
Redrey Brown
Coulda sworn I seen ya face in a cloud
Family grievin on your last breath
Close to the heart whether you know it or not
I swear the love wont stop
Jewel thats my boo Mom Duke and Lou
From jump you kept it true helped to feed the crew
The good die young
Livin fast jumpin the gun
Mama blamin the community for killin her son
My cousin Darren wasnt scared of goin
But never knowin he was dyin slower
I guess I see ya when I see ya soldier
Does anybody have an answer why
It seems the good die young
Can anybody tell me why
Can anybody tell me why
I know my life aint promised
Thats why the wise move in silence
Analyze these scandalous times
Its hard Dogg but we manage
Schools turn to war zones
Even homes unsafe
Leavin children to play caged and raged
They hate how come
Someone explain why the good die young
Why the bad die slow and outlive everyone
Its time somethin is done
For our young kids
They growin opus
That aint the way to live
Tell me why
Days go past and as they pass
Time move quicker
No time for wastin
Put your hustle down my young dealers
Cause the end is nearer
But at least thats what they tellin me
Hell all I know brothers
Aint ridin four three felonys
Its time to plan plot and strategize
Capitalize mobilize
We in the war yall
Its for all yall
My family to the ones that stabbed me
Little bit mo love is whats recommended
Yeah and its plain to see
The seeds from you and me
Gon be the ones to lead us towards unity
Thats if we treat them right
Man teach them right
Raise your kids better than you was
And see what it does
But if you dont
Man we sho to be done
And well all see exactly
Why the good die young
Does anybody have an answer why
It seems the good die young
Can anybody tell me why
Can anybody tell me why
Does anybody have an answer why
It seems the good die young
Can anybody tell me why
Can anybody tell me why
This is for all my homeboys that passed away
And all yo homeboys that passed away
I send this out to all the fallen fallen soldiers
Thats in the cemeteries buried
Never got to see they dreams
For everything I touch you touch
For every step I take you take
For every breath I breathe you breathe
Every dollar I make you make
I told you wed make it to the sunshine one day
You just got there a little quicker
But like my homeboys thugs say
Ill catch ya at the crossroads
The good die young
This song is dedicated to all them
Young kids and people that are innocent
That died young at Columbine High
Rest in peace Oklahoma Outlawz
Lil young Xzandafer Tasha all them
All the fallen kids the dead babies
The closed caskets InaudibleLittle somethin for my godson Elijah and a little girl named Corinne
Some say the blacker the berry the sweeter the juice
I say the darker the flesh then the deeper the roots
I give a holler to my sisters on welfare
Tupac cares if dont nobody else care
And uhh I know they like to beat ya down a lot
When you come around the block brothas clown a lot
But please dont cry dry your eyes never let up
Forgive but dont forget girl keep your head up
And when he tells you you aint nuttin dont believe him
And if he cant learn to love you you should leave him
Cause sista you dont need him
And I aint tryin to gas ya up I just call em how I see em
You know it makes me unhappy whats that
When brothas make babies and leave a young mother to be a pappy
And since we all came from a woman
Got our name from a woman and our game from a woman
I wonder why we take from our women
Why we rape our women do we hate our women
I think its time to kill for our women
Time to heal our women be real to our women
And if we dont well have a race of babies
That will hate the ladies that make the babies
And since a man cant make one
He has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one
So will the real men get up
I know youre fed up ladies but keep your head up
Keep ya head up oooo child things are gonna get easier
ooooo child things are gonna get brighter
Keep ya head up oooo child things are gonna get easier
ooooo child things are gonna get brighter
Aiyyo I remember Marvin Gaye used to sing ta me
He had me feelin like black was tha thing to be
And suddenly tha ghetto didnt seem so tough
And though we had it rough we always had enough
I huffed and puffed about my curfew and broke the rules
Ran with the local crew and had a smoke or two
And I realize momma really paid the price
She nearly gave her life to raise me right
And all I had ta give her was my pipe dream
Of how Id rock the mic and make it to tha bright screen
Im tryin to make a dollar out of fifteen cents
Its hard to be legit and still pay tha rent
And in the end it seems Im headin for tha pen
I try and find my friends but theyre blowin in the wind
Last night my buddy lost his whole family
Its gonna take the man in me to conquer this insanity
It seems tha rainll never let up
I try to keep my head up and still keep from gettin wet up
You know its funny when it rains it pours
They got money for wars but cant feed the poor
Say there aint no hope for the youth and the truth is
it aint no hope for tha future
And then they wonder why we crazy
I blame my mother for turning my brother into a crack baby
We aint meant to survive cause its a setup
And even though youre fed up
Huh ya got to keep your head up
Keep ya head up oooo child things are gonna get easier
ooooo child things are gonna get brighter
And uhh
To all the ladies havin babies on they own
I know its kinda rough and youre feelin all alone
Daddys long gone and he left you by ya lonesome
Thank the Lord for my kids even if nobody else want em
Cause I think we can make it in fact Im sure
And if you fall stand tall and comeback for more
Cause aint nuttin worse than when your son
wants to kno why his daddy dont love him no mo
You cant complain you was dealt this
hell of a hand without a man feelin helpless
Because theres too many things for you to deal with
Dying inside but outside youre looking fearless
While tears is rollin down your cheeks
Ya steady hopin things dont all down this week
Cause if it did you couldnt take it and dont blame me
I was given this world I didnt make it
And now my sons getten older and older and cold
From havin the world on his shoulders
While the rich kids is drivin Benz
Im still tryin to hold on to my survivin friends
And its crazy it seems itll never let up but
please you got to keep your head upYoung Noble
Yo I can see
That you obviously dont know me or my homies

You sure to see about ten nz in a bedroom
Eating off the same spoon
Sweeping with the same broom
Its hazard its you dont want yo life
Well give me grab it
I was born inside a love zone
With a glock-nine young marriage
Its critical
Then one of them sat down living so
Mystikal and empoious
With a heart full of anger its so redicilous
So give me some with twenty-one-gun soldier salute
With a nineteen-inch black handle snake knife in my boots
Im straight from the strong thug to your life
Right to yo wrong Ill put the good to your evil
Im the shells to your chrome you dig that
Im life Ill bring the moon to your night
Ill put the dick to your wife
And Im the Jesuz of your Christ
You dig that respect this
Ill bring the end to your claw
Ill bring the loc to your heart
And Ill put the snoop on yo dogs

We follow this little bullet so hollow
I can promise that estacy aint promised tomorrow
With this two man mades
Me and my soul death astrayed

Got my eyes on you the first time you cross me
Ill be frying you cause whyall dont know me
Young Noble Chorus

Thug in Peace to all my nz Never
See ya soon uhhWord its like all we got left
Teardrops and closed caskets
Throw it up fool hey n
Tell me how you feel homie
Yeah
It took a week to go down you recollect and see how crazy it sounds
The whole towns on a mission adolescents penitentiary bound
Now introducin young Trigga
Since birth eyes set on gettin bigger
Just another wild a n
But he was fiendin for Precious what
But Precious was a ghetto girl
Couldnt be no sex without that gold Lexus
But lil Trigga was heartbroken he had to get his papers
Seein visions of people smokin and nz catchin vapors
Got his man from around the corner well call him Lil Mo
Been in so many reform schools they had to let him go
Heres where the plot thickens
They got a plot to make a profit with they glocks spittin
They call the squad hittin blocks with they guns blowin
Somebodys gonna die tonight
Still no ones knowin so they kept goin
Catchin dealers comin out they cars will they survive
Two semi automatic nines them nz died
Plus nobody in the hood cries its like they celebrate
To death and wish they could die so peep the lesson
But wait a minute back to Precious
Shes snortin dope in the backseat of Triggs Lexus
Teardrops and closed caskets
Will I forever be alone
Teardrops and closed caskets
Teardrops and closed caskets
Will I forever be alone
Teardrops and closed caskets
Dont let these ghetto streets get you Precious
Was the victim from a dime to a nickel
Hopin Gods blessings stick with ya
Picture the neighborhood kingpin whos gettin bigger
Familiar face but a man now its lil Trigga
Now Lil Mo was a soldier to the fullest
Down for his homies always the first to spit bullets
All he wanted was to be a thug
Never pictured his truest homeboy would fall in love
Heres where it gets ya
Now Precious is pregnant lil Trigga is happy
He wants to marry her now not knowin he aint the daddy
But precious was lonely while lil Trigga was makin dough
Shes slippin in secret places and gettin with Lil Mo
The neighborhoods buzzin now people are talkin
Lil Triggas gettin pictures of the both of em walkin
Hand in hand couldnt understand
How his babys mama could disappear
With another man and his best friend
Now jealousys dangerous and if you dont believe me
Then watch the way that this story ends and maybe youll see
There aint no heroes or villains aint no pleasure in killin
Just the smoke from the cap peelin a man with no feelings
Teardrops and closed caskets
Will I forever be alone
Teardrops and closed caskets
Bury you dead and look ahead
A man with no feelings
Teardrops and closed caskets
Will I forever be alone
Teardrops and closed caskets
Thats all we got left thats all
Now with the problems of poverty and the tricks to these tales
How many people will die How many will live to tell
Although best friends before Lil Trigga and Mo
They in an all out war over a fiend they aint know
Behind the curtains their privacy lust is already laid down
The results is the same with different names and it turns out
Yall know how it is same old thing in the same old town
Lil Trigg got his nose wide open on this one trick now hes played out
Think its Lil Mo was plottin plans on gettin bigger
Precious was his way to put his hands on Lil Trigga
All the while lets look at Precious
Too dumb to see whats goin down too doped up to ask questions
Used to be comrades but now we blast on sight
What could be so bad
God will we last tonight
From misdemeanors to felonies small time to sellin kis
I cant believe the s they tellin me
They open fire three bodies drop so call the cops
Precious Lil Mo and Trigg
Teardrops and closed caskets
Will I forever be alone
Aiy QBIII in this motherfer
Teardrops and closed caskets
We dedicate this to all the fallen comrades thats right
All the homies that didnt make it to see this day
Rest in peace
Will I forever be alone
Ya know what I hmean I know its hard out there
With teardrops and closed caskets
Its like thats all we got to look forward to these days
Murders brothers dyin funerals
Will I forever be alone
S its like I aint gonna wear another suit homey
I done ran out of tears
We goin have to do somethin yall
We goin have to do somethin
Will I forever be alone
Cause I know all these mothers is tired of seein the same thing
Rest in peace
Teardrops and closed caskets
I send this out to Mthulu Geronimo
And to all the fallen comrades all the soldiers
Will I forever be alone
To the homie Boonie rest in peace n
All the homies that fell all the homies
May God bless your families
May you always live in the motherfin heart
Will I forever be alone
In a thug nz heart forever
Thats right
Rest in peace n
May your enemies be deceased dead on the streets
We cant have peace til the ns get a pieceLet it be prophesized nsll die because ya crews goon
Around the way ns get murdered by the full moon
Heard it in whispered tones
Ns is bold and they choose to roll
I kill em all watch now n truth be told
Westside was the war cry look how they scatter
Ns dyin by my thirty-yard brainsll splatter
Wonder why these ns cross me
Im certified crasy so sick the world made me
Now diggy-die everytime I ride its for reasons
Hard to kill a n cause Im comin back like Jesus
Bow down to my ill nation runnin from drug cases
Lookin at my congregation so full of thug faces
Momma gave a n breath a life of stress
I invest in a vest and makin ns watch they every step
Label me a threat
And I aint even got started with this s yet
Thug style baby hands on my pistol listen Im a rida
Every n breathin pay attention

Even though we broke for the moment well be ballin again
Til I make it yo my military be prepared for them bustas
Similar to bes that scary get too near me we rushin
Visions of over-packed prisons fiends and ns thug livin
Pressures and three strikes I hope they dont test us
They pull the heater ammunition it cranks psssh
Move without a sound as we slide down pistols in place
They got me fiendin for currency the money be callin
Its like Im dreamin see in season me ballin
Participated in felonious behavior
C the ced fo-five snatchin ns pagers
Labeled a mark soon as we start it was hard to quit
We started out drinkin fortys moved to harder s

The boss ns definitely put it down strictly
EDI Amin until the law come for me
Kill em all for shortie ninety-nine Killuminati
They got me thinkin strugglin and hustlings my only fate
Toppin grams on the kitchen plate tryin to keep that money straight
Times is rollin three up these streets sleep
But when I crack hammer ced back rapped in my sheets
My lifes been crossed crooked since a seed it hurts
Got a package from the devil payin my deeds
Preoccupied by the greed in this crooked life I lead
More funds to spend or bigger guns to squeeze
Me and my thugs clock Gs simpin naughty thangs

Get on yo knees nigga
Get on yo knees and pray
Huh increase the doses bustin whoever closest
Thug livin hell or prison never losin my focus
I m makin money moves mandatory
In a discussion my past records tell a story
Picture niggaz we rushin and still bustin
Til the cops come runnin duck in abandoned buildings
Ditchin my gun homeboy the motherfuckin villain
I live the lifestyles of drug dealers but now legit list
So I laugh til I cry when the law come get me
No baby momma drama nigga miss me why plant seeds
In a dirty bitch waitin to trick me not the life for me
Livin carefree til I m buried - and if they dare me
I m bustin on niggaz until they scurry I m clearly
A man of military means in my artillery
Watchin over me through every murder scene
From adolescence to my early teens thought we was gonna die
Sellin dope to all the fiends at times I want to cry
And still we try to change the past in vain
Never knowin if this game ll last feelin ashamed
Of cocaine the product of the devil am I sellin my soul
Got tired of small time livin niggaz tellin me no
I got MINE FUCK THEM OTHER SUCKERS that s the mentality
Jealous-ass bustaz make it hell for us
Lord help me change my ways
Show a little mercy on judgment day
It ain t me I was raised this way
I never let em play me for a busta make it hell four a hustler
EDI Amin
Now in these last days and times I takes mines so serious
Gotta get that paper quickly and escape the sickness
If I fail then I suffer bein broke is hell four a hustler
So I stay strugglin and jugglin with all the might I can muster
Since a youngster been money hungry moved in
One s five s and ten s was funny money
So I sets my sights bigger four figures or mo
Real nigga for sure out in the cold for dough
What you thought lost homies in plenty battles
Last two years shed plenty tears and I ll send plenty at you
Let me catch you slippin you soft niggaz is outta here
In case you forgot we on the same shit that got us here
Young Noble
Yo to every step I take every foul I make
Every jail I break every mill I ate
Head to head whoever hustle hardest
On the block duckin charges nigga fuck the sergeant
He got a job all my bottles got a pinch of coke
Listen tho I m missin dough I gotta gather mo
Hell naw dead blocks with red tops but now a nigga sell words
For all my young thugs in jail in Jerz
They made it hell four a hustler I bails high as fuck son
Dyin luck none supply us with much guns
I buck one just to let you know that I can touch ya
Slangin cracks or raps still hell four a hustler
Chorus

No insanity plea for me I ride the beef til I burn
Sensimilla bar your kids from the lessons I learned
And in turn I m hostile guess you could call me anti-social
Niggaz shakin like they caught the holy ghost when I approach em
Try to politic before I smoke em like Sun Zu
Niggaz do unto these snitches before it s done to you
And if the cops come arrest me in the evening
Best believe they comin for my dogs in the mornin
And if I die by a slug the death of a true thug
Tell me will my niggaz mourn me Gettin blowed out
High watch me murder the bird before he testify
Strikes walkin close to my third I live a trouble life
And if you dream be a part of my team
From Long Beach to Queens drug dealers to ex-fiends
Keep yo eyes on the prize nigga watch for bustaz
Either heaven or jail it s still hell four a hustler
Chorus
twoPac
This is how we ride
Not knowin if we ll live or die
Catch me rollin with my motherfuckin guns on the side
In case of drama I m the first to break wild til they all die
This is how we ride
Not knowin if we ll live or die
Catch me rollin with my motherfuckin guns on the side
In case of drama I m the first to break wild
Until they all die Outlaw
Yes change my ways yes
The Black Jesus guide us through this
Weary weary weary weary
Only God can save us
Nothin but boss players
Outlawz and thugsLive back at cha Westside baby
Aight fuck it we gone flip some new shit now
You heard All Eyez on Me niggas know what time it is
Makaveli the Don Pac do it like that
Rhymin and stealin sellin five million
Outlaw ninety-nine
Fresh out on bail niggas still cant see me
Napoleon EDI Young Noble Fatal Hussein
Thats how it is
Now we got a new motherfuckin plan and a new mission
Makaveli the Don Greg Nice Outlaw Outlaw
Competition so they say these niggas is gay
Outlaw - Outlaw
Blast me It could never happen
At least not while Im walkin and rappin
Heard of some niggas on the other side of town who want to ride wit me
Throw ya hands up hands up
They cant hide listen to the rough shit my click
Throw ya motherfuckin hands up
I said many times busters still cant see
Yall niggas cant fuck with me Outlaw
I been handlin stress in this shit for years
Blazed out sheddin tattooed tears now I
Said many times busters still cant see
Yall niggas cant fuck with me Outlaw
I been handlin stress in this shit for years
Blazed out sheddin tattooed tears
Now Rock-a-bye baby Im thugged out and so crazy
Dont want to hurt a soul nigga so dont make me
I got a dream to see my whole team in Lexus Coupes
My enemies dead n buried now the stress is through
But thats a dream though it seems like reality therell
Never be peace long as theres fiends on these Cali streets
Even on the other side brothers die but ride
Niggas get high off a slow form of suicide
Hide the closest thoughts the war is fought as casualties
I live my life to fuckin mo exposin tragically
How can we find some peace and niggas still aint get a piece
I know Im probably hell bound but we got to eat
Im seeing Satin infiltratin my military mind
Make me hustle all the time go out for cash makin
Forgive my adversaries they dont understand what we go through
To become a man we sheddin tattooed tears
I said many times busters still cant see
Yall niggas cant fuck with me Outlaw
I been handlin stress in this shit for years
Blased out sheddin tattooed tears now I
Said many times busters still cant see
Yall niggas cant fuck with me Outlaw
I been handlin stress in this shit for years
Blazed out sheddin tattooed tears
Thugged out baby
We dont shed tears we shed blood
Do you still want to be a thug Huh What
We dont shed tears we shed blood
Do you still want to be a thug
Yo criminal ways of thinkin made me crave Abe Lincolns
The days I spent stinkin caught victims on the weekends
Seeking a better path expose a better half of me
Blast for me the task after me
For a few years sheddin tattooed tears
Like Gram Sammy we feudin for the whole damn family
We scarred up homies is barred up for mad time
Outlawz locked down for some past crimes
Fast dimes made my stash grow smaller
Your block aint no harder fake baller
Nigga its like this
I been thuggin just for the cause of it
Out to get all of it but Ill never loose my balls and shit
And its all for the pressure
Thatll make me cock my shit up off the dresser
Made nigga mafia of course my niggas gonna test ya
Answers to the questions bullets to my Smith N Wesson
Still stucked up in a fuck session Jersey where the niggas flexin
Po-pos guessin if the stolen car gonna do a drive-by
Wet em up from his shoulders leave him bye-bye
Now mama cry-cry but it aint my time to either die-die
So ask me why-why but I feel that God owe me my life
For the things he did but I turn my pleasure into sin
Blazed out sheddin tattooed tears
I said many times busters still cant see
Yall niggas cant fuck with me Outlaw
I been handlin stress in this shit for years
Blased out sheddin tattooed tears now I
Said many times busters still cant see
Yall niggas cant fuck with me Outlaw
I been handlin stress in this shit for years
Blazed out sheddin tattooed tears
Shit aint no unity in my community its do or die
Seein my opportunities through these bars of hell while gettin high
As life replays like time underhanded schemes
To get that cream and thangs while livin this life of crime
My enemies want me squeezed
They get dumped like threes with fifty-seven wasted at they knees
Please beware we thugs revolution size
Criminals dare be last mental me institutionalize
Locked down got many shell shocked now
Holdin down fort like Im stuck in court cell block style
Yo I been loosin sleep stay awake way past late
Visions of killers en masse at the blast mayne
As I lay here gatted down and tatted
Knowin now its hard to slow down for a addict
Its been years of stugglin guzzlin beers
Beefin and never even aint no love in the air
And I suffer my shit in hell talkin to the heavens
Walkin through the valley of death with my fellas
I lost a lot startin with hope I tried
And for every tattoo I got a moment I cried
Im through with the lies the two in my eyes yell pain
Step in my shoes nothin to lose but my brain
Ima hold it down tho with all the struggle to bear
Aint nothing to fear cryin these tattooed tears come on
I said many times busters still cant see
Yall niggas cant fuck with me Outlaw
I been handlin stress in this shit for years
Blased out sheddin tattooed tears now I
Said many times busters still cant see
Yall niggas cant fuck with me Outlaw
I been handlin stress in this shit for years
Blazed out sheddin tattooed tearsAs the world turns
As the world turns my niggaz grow and grow and grow
And get dough and roll and ride
Niggaz die and mommas cry
Niggaz got alibis and suicides and homicides
And three strikes and yo life and my life and times change
And niggaz fame as the world turns
Though I walk through the valley of hell the shadow follows me
Wisdom hard to swallow tomorrow expect apologies
You probably panic stranded in search of a better planet
Realism hard to understand we stand slanted
And still stranded merciless thieves stole the best of me
I pray to black Jesus to please take the rest of me
And still the best of us build and reach monetary gains
Some of us kill but still most of us can change
If we search deeper God bless the hustler
Curse the first sleeper
Enemies get beside me flows go deeper inside
We we ride plots keep all my enemies blinded
Time will soon show a thought can last for years
Outshinin them fakes smile plastic tears
Like last year niggaz stuck in the past and its clear
Just some busta ass bastards allergic to cash this year
Makaveli for the Mob M-O-be
Killin bustaz is my motherfuckin job him or me
Lyrically fatally driven niggaz reported missin
My competition dead or in prison as the world turns
As the world keeps turnin round and round
My niggaz grow and grow and grow
Its gon be goin round
And gettin dough and dough and dough
As the world turns and steady turnin
From this state to that state
From this cell to that cell as the world turns
As the world turn burnin paths starin through my rear view
Its a war goin on and the President is in too
I hear Tu-Pac sayin Watch em theyll kill you
Sippin Thug Passion scrub actin like he feel you
Steady plottin ready or not Outlawz lost
But not forgotten from Gittere to Compton
A spitter of the hotness long timeness
So like six I aint never been rich
I need cream to buy Ellene a dream house
She no longer fiend out yall Outlaw
Another lonely nigga with a twelve-gage pump
With a twelve-hour rush to run and get this money fuck these punks
Road rules I swim in the dirt I stay in some skirt
I hit where it hurts I ride or die for my turf
I ride or die for Makaveli the legendary war thug nigga
Kadafi betta unslug this nigga Seike betta undrug this nigga
Out of the buildin we street children with no souls
Our hearts gon stay cold the war gon stay on
We serve em like Pac told us to catch em wet with the tec
Hit em in the neck and watch him die like he supposed to
Napoleon the front line soldier front times over
Rider for the mightly dollar rather drunk or sober
Nigga talkin thug walkin all through yo squad
Yall niggaz scared by a dog I got my fo-fo for yall
Its like a hot heated day homie warfare dont play homie
Better be prepared than try to dunk away from these strays homie
Worlds turn thangs burn all in one shot
Rest in peace to the fallen soldiers
All that we got
As the world turns
As the world keeps turnin round and round
And my niggaz roll and ride
Its gon be goin round as the world turns
Niggaz gettin swoll out
And steady turnin
And it dont stop and it dont quit
That real shit
As the world keeps turnin round and round
Niggaz die for how many you niggaz try for this
Its gon be goin round as the world turns
As the world turns murderin methods Outlaw
Only haters caught feelings when my homie caught millions
And acquired the desired status of boss livin
We cross driven cornered into a life thats hellish
Payin our dues with bloodshed aint shit yall could tell us
Fellas mount up its time for battle its on now
Two worlds collidin armies ridin soldiers gone wild
Sometimes I think my glory days was back in my youth
I sought too for family but I got it lost in these ounces
Now as the world turns court adjourns Im sentenced to burn
The cost of my sins too much nuttin left to earn
October nineth one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-seven first day out my baby carriage
Married my Mack-eleven hit the block playin
Only five years up in this bitch poppa runnin from the Feds
Puttin peanut butter on the walls to hide his prints
Me on my own not yet grown but only man of the home
To protect my zone in these streets I roam
Dough on d-low downin straight shots of Cristal Brothers
Hundred dollar snot box on cee-lo fuck eighth
I need a kilo got a plot move my block down state
Got the drop on the spot movin pounds of weight
Fuck my fate and lots of loot to burn a hustlers yearn
For this dirty money earned as this crooked world turns
As the world turns and turns and turns and turns
As the world keeps turnin round and round
Its gon be goin round
This for the soldiers out there involved in the everyday struggle
Hopin to bubble keep on hustlin as the world turns
As the world turns and turns and turns and turns
Money come and go hoes come and go foes come and go
Its gon be goin round
Friends come and go my soldiers stay eternal
As the world keeps turnin round and round

Now the punks in deep shit
Catch him on the streets bring him to his feet quick
Pass the clip I think I see him coming now
Fuck the bullshit posse deep and lets run him down
Gots to be the first one to hit yah when we meet
Coming quickly up the street is the punk ass police
The first one jumped out and said freeze
I popped him in his knees and shot him punk please
These cops are reminded and get us as when we rush
Now you clear like a bitch cause you dont know how to hush
Now back to the smoke of the robbery
I tell you like Latifah mutha-fucker give me body
One to the chest another to his fucking dome

A noisy ass cop and a nigga that robbed from me

Meet Cindi shes twenty-two lives right on the dope track
Used to be fat now weighs less than a Tic-Tac
Now whats that say about this big epidemic
This hypocritical world and the people in it
Now speaking of in it Cindi loved to get buckwild
Fuck with a smile single file shell bust nuff styles
That would be cool if she was your lover
But fuck that Cindi was my dope fiend mother
Welfare checks never stepped through the front door
Cause moms would run to the dopeman once more
All those days had me fiending for a hot meal
Now Im a crook got steel I do not feel
So dont even trip when I flip with my thirty-eight
Revenge is a bitch and my hit shake the murder rate
Word to the mutha Im touched
When moms come by niggas hush or get rushed
Maybe one day shell recover
But what will it take to shake or break

I grew up in a home where no-one liked me
Moms would hit the pipe every night she would fight me
Poppa was a nasty old man like the rest
Hes feeling on my chest with his hand in my dress
Just another pest and yes I was nervous
Blood sensor tests I just dont deserve this
I want to tell mom but would she listen
Shes bound to be bitching if she hasnt got a fix in
So now I lay me down to sleep
Lord dont let him rape me
If he does my soul to keep
Dont let the devil take me
Cant concentrate I contemplate in my classroom
Thinking how my step dad raped me in the bathroom
Every day I make class and yet Im missing periods
The thought of pregnancy is in my head and now Im fearing it
I gotta tell mom before she sees me
I told her how he Gd me and she didnt believe me
Calling me a slut cause my butts kinda big so
Still that aint no way to be talking to your kids though
I cant believe the way you call it
Gotta believe in him and dissing her own daughter
Time for me to break and find another
Thats when I discovered
The ways of the days of a part time mutha
Shes a part time

I rush to tend her talked as I touch her
She blushed the clothes came off and I bust her
Im up now ready to get drunk on the block
Here take a cab thanks a lot for the cot
Shes gone and Im thinking that my games so strong
Pat myself on the back and move on
Is this just how it is hell no
cause she came back with the kid and yo
I been paying ever since
The clothes the food the cars and oh the rent
All of my time gets spent at the workplace
No time to kiss her got me list in the first place
So I do the dishes and clean the floor
When I sleep I cant dream anymore
Oh no now Im a part time mutha
And I change the diapers and clean the shit
The tables are turned I cant take this
Oh no now Im a part time mutha

Tupac put a cross on his back you wanna put crosses on yo back
Nigga you aint Tupac
This is Tupac
Money and women funny beginnings tragic endings
I can make a million and still not get enough of spendin
And since my life is based on sinnin Im Hell bound
Rather be buried that be worried livin held down
My game plan to be trained in
Military mind of a thug lord sittin in a cemetery cryin
Ive been lost since my adolescence calling for Jesus
Bawlin as a youngster wonderin if He sees us
Young Black males
Crack sales got me three strikes
Livin in jail this is Hell enemies die
Wonder when we all pass is anybody listenin
Got my hands on my semi shotty everybodys snitchin
Please God can you understand me Bless my family
Guide us all before we fall into insanity
Im makin a point to make my beatin bumpin raw life
Drop some shit Incomprehensible these stupid bitches jaw tight
Till Makaveli returns its all eyes on me on me
And you can hate it or love it but thats what its gon be gon be
Shoulda listened I told you not to fuck wit me wit me
Now can you take the pressure thats what we gon see gon see
This is a cry for mercy I promise
My success would be the death of you
Lo and behold you sold ya soul nigga theres nothing left of you
Look in the mirror ask yourself who are you
If you dont know who you are how could ya dreams come true
Motherfucker I sat back and watched you pretended to be Pac
You pretended to be hot but you not now
I see it so clear you cant take the pressure you pussy
I warned you not to push me
You see me and chills run up ya spine
God made menace in war but ya heart aint like mine
And plus they look at me like Im a menace
I was playing wit guns while ya momma had you
And your punk ass playing tennis
Im a nightmare you see me in ya dream
Wake up and turn on ya TV and see my ass again
You cowardly hearted you couldnt make it on ya own
Fuck the source Im on the cover of Rolling Stone
Till Makaveli returns its all eyes on me on me
And you can hate it or love it but thats what its gon be gon be
Shoulda listened I told you not to fuck wit me wit me
Now can you take the pressure thats what we gon see gon see
Till Makaveli returns its all eyes on me on me
And you can hate it or love it but thats what its gon be gon be
Shoulda listened I told you not to fuck wit me wit me
Now can you take the pressure thats what we gon see gon seeTupac Shakur
Right now it is it is almost it is almost uhh
IMPOSSIBLE for you not to see how strong rap has gotten
YknowhatImsayin its its like umm
our our brothers and sisters our youths and some of our adults
their ear is PINNED to rap music right now
And if you really wanna get our message out
and really wanna start teachin we need to start doin that
We we really need to start usin our methods yknowhatImsayin
The Last Poets did it with poetry
And uhh and and even in our history
from a ancient Afl- African civilization
poets went from village to village
And thats how stories and messages and lessons were taught
YknowhatImssayin and so like you say history repeats itself
And so it it was it was at it was yknow obvious
It was pick it up yknow
Bein the race that we are bein the strong race that we are
We picked it up we picked up those positive those positive vibes
and we started rappin and so
I think it is its a very good medium tooDeath Row
Thats where motherfuckers is endin up
Dear mama Im caught up in this sickness
I rob my adversaries but Slick done left a witness
Wonder if theyll catch me or will this nigga snitch
Should I shoot his bitch or make the nigga rich
Dont want to commit murder but damn they got me trapped
Hawkin while Im walkin and talkin behind my back
Im kind of schizophrenic Im in this shit to win it
Cause lifes a Wheel of Fortune heres my chance to spin it
Got no time for cops who trip and try to catch me
Too fuckin trigger happy to let them suckers snatch me
Niggaz gettin jealous jealous tryin to find my stash
Whip out the nine now Ima dive and pump your ass
Peter picked a pepper but I can pick a punk
Snatched him like a bitch and threw him in the trunk
The punk thought I was bluffin but swear Im nothin nice
Before I take your life first wrestle with these mics
I listen to him scream Tray Deee went insane
I guess the little mites had finally found his brain
New Rovers pull me over Im sentenced to the pen
Remember that little bird he snitched and told a friend
Its trouble on my mind Im with the old timers
And fuck five-oh blaow blaow turn em into forty-niners
Bye bye I was never meant to live
Cant be positive when the ghettos where you live
Bye bye I was never meant to be
Livin like a thief runnin through the streets
Bye bye and I got no place to go
Where they find me sixteen on Death Row
Dear mama these cops dont understand me
I turned to a life of crime cause I came from a broken family
My uncle used to touch me I never told you that
Scared what you might do I couldnt hold you back
I kept it deep inside I done let it fuel my anger
Im down for all my homies no mercy for a stranger
The brother in my set is sixteen is wet
Its hard to adapt when youre black and youre trapped in a livin
Hell
I shouldnta let him catch me
Instead of livin sad in jail I coulda died free and happy
And my cellmates raped on the norm
And passed around the dorm you can hear his asshole gettin torn
They made me an animal
Cant sleep instead of countin sheep niggaz countin cannibals
And thats how it is in the pen
Turn old and cold and your soul is your best friend
My mama prayed for me
Tell the Lord to make way for me prepare any day for me why
Cause when they come for me they find a struggler
To the death I take the breath from your jugular
The trick is to never lose hope
I found my buddy hangin dead from a rope sixteen on Death Row
Bye bye I was never meant to live
Cant be positive when the ghettos where you live
Bye bye I was never meant to be
Livin like a thief runnin through the streets
Bye bye and I got no place to go
Where you find me sixteen on Death Row
Dear mama they sentenced me to death
Todays my final day Im countin every breath
Im bitter cause Im dyin so much I havent seen
I know you never dreamed your baby would be dead at sixteen
I got beef with a sick society that doesnt give a shit
And they too quick to say goodbye to me
They tell me the preachers there for me
Hes a crook with a book that motherfucker never cared for me
Hes only here to be sure
I dont drop a dime to God bout the crimes hes commitin
on the poor and how can these people judge me
They aint my peers and in all these years they aint never love me
I never got to be a man must be part of some big plan
to keep a nigga in the state pen
And to my homies out buryin motherfuckers
Steer clear of these Aryan motherfuckers
Cause once they got you locked up
They got you trapped youre better off gettin shot
Im convinced self-defense is the way
Please stay strapped pack a gat every day
I wish I woulda known while I was out there
Now Im straight headin for the chair
Bye bye I was never meant to live
Cant be positive when the ghettos where we live
Bye bye I was never meant to be
Livin like a thief runnin through the streets
Bye bye and I got no place to go
Where you find me sixteen on Death Row
sixteen on Death Row
Its to all my partners in the penitentiaries
sixteen on Death RowThey got a nigga shedding tears reminiscin on my past fears
Cause shit was hectic for me last year
It appears that Ive been marked for death
My heartless breath the underlying cause of my arrest
My life is stressed and no rest forever weary
My eyes stay teary for all the brothers that are buried in the
cemetery
Shit is scary how black on black crime legendary
But at times unnessecary Im gettin worried
Teardrops and closed caskets the three strikes law is drastic
And certain death for us ghetto bastards
What can we do when were arrested but open fire
Life in the pen aint for me cause Id rather die
But dont cry through your despair
I wonder if the Lord still cares for us niggaz on welfare
And who cares if we survive
The only time they notice a nigga is when he clutchin on a four-five
My neighborhood aint the same
Cause all these little babies goin crazy and they sufferin in the game
And I swear its like a trap
But I aint given up on the hood its all good when I go back
Hoes show me love niggaz give me props
Forever hop cause it dont stop on my block
Now shits constantly hot on my block it never fails to be gunshots
Cant explain a mothers pain when her son drops
Black male slippin in hail when will we prevail
Fearin jail but crack sales got me livin well
And the systems sucidal with this Thugs Life
Stayin strapped forever strapped in this drug life
God help me cause Im starvin cant get a job
So I resort to violent robberies my life is hard
Cant sleep cause all the dirt make my heart hurt
Put in work and shed tears for my dead peers
Mislead from childhood where I went astray
Till this day I still pray for a better way
Cant help but feel hopeless and heartbroke
From the start I felt the racism cause Im dark
Couldnt quit the bullshit make me represent
Hit the bar and played the star everywhere I went
In my heart I felt alone out here on my own
I close my eyes and picture home on my block
And I cant help but wonder whhhy so many young kids had to die
Caught strays from AKs and the driveby
Swollen pride and homicide dont coincide
Brothers cry for broken lives mama come inside
Cause our block is filled with danger
Used to be a close knit community but now were all cold strangers
Time changes us to stone them crack pipes
All up and down the block exterminatin black life
But I cant blame the dealers
My mamas welfare check has brought the next man chrome wheels
Shits real I know ya feel my tragedy
A single mother with a problem child daddy free
Hangin out pickin up game sippin cheap liquor
Gamin the hoochies hopin I can get to sleep with her
Its a mans world stayin strapped
Fantasies of a nigga livin phat but held back
Pipe dreams can make the night seem hopeless
Wide eyed and losin focus on my block
And block parties in tha projects lastin way past daylight
A young nigga learned to break nine
Used to play fight with my homies but they stuck in the pen
I send them ends but its tough on a friend in my mind
I see the same motherfuckers ballin
Alcohol will make a lazy nigga slip and fall miss his call
I know the young niggaz understand this
Growing up in this world where everything is scandalous
I reminisce on tha fast times past crimes
Tryin to cop a slice of pizza with my last dime
Cant explain just what attracts me to this dirty game
Gold chains some extra change and the street fame
And whats strange is that everybody knows my name swear they all
know me
And lots of cash make a nigga change
I hit the green just to maintain feelin pain
For all the niggaz that I lost to the game from my blockNow youve been actin like you want it for a long time
All up in a nigga face givin me them strong vibes
Look in my eyes and youll find peace
A gemini so you really blow my mind freak cmon

Sagittarius Taurus Cancer all you freaky fucks
Im a zodiac fucker Ill do you all one at a time
And all day long lets get busyLittle somethin for my godson Elijah and a little girl named Corinne
Some say the blacker the berry the sweeter the juice
I say the darker the flesh then the deeper the roots
I give a holler to my sisters on welfare
Tupac cares if dont nobody else care
And uh I know they like to beat ya down a lot
When you come around the block brothas clown a lot
But please dont cry dry your eyes never let up
Forgive but dont forget girl keep your head up
And when he tells you you aint nuttin dont believe him
And if he cant learn to love you you should leave him
Cause sista you dont need him
And I aint tryin to gas ya up I just call em how I see em
You know it makes me unhappy whats that
When brothas make babies and leave a young mother to be a pappy
And since we all came from a woman
Got our name from a woman and our game from a woman
I wonder why we take from our women
Why we rape our women do we hate our women
I think its time to kill for our women
Time to heal our women be real to our women
And if we dont well have a race of babies
That will hate the ladies that make the babies
And since a man cant make one
He has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one
So will the real men get up
I know youre fed up ladies but keep your head up
Keep ya head up ooh child things are gonna get easier
Ooh child things are gonna get brighter
Keep ya head up ooh child things are gonna get easier
Ooh child things are gonna get brighter
Aiyyo I remember Marvin Gaye used to sing ta me
He had me feelin like black was tha thing to be
And suddenly tha ghetto didnt seem so tough
And though we had it rough we always had enough
I huffed and puffed about my curfew and broke the rules
Ran with the local crew and had a smoke or two
And I realize momma really paid the price
She nearly gave her life to raise me right
And all I had ta give her was my pipe dream
Of how Id rock the mic and make it to tha bright screen
Im tryin to make a dollar out of fifteen cents
Its hard to be legit and still pay tha rent
And in the end it seems Im headin for tha pen
I try and find my friends but theyre blowin in the wind
Last night my buddy lost his whole family
Its gonna take the man in me to conquer this insanity
It seems tha rainll never let up
I try to keep my head up and still keep from gettin wet up
You know its funny when it rains it pours
They got money for wars but cant feed the poor
Say there aint no hope for the youth and the truth is
It aint no hope for tha future
And then they wonder why we crazy
I blame my mother for turning my brother into a crack baby
We aint meant to survive cause its a setup
And even though youre fed up
Huh ya got to keep your head up
Keep ya head up ooh child things are gonna get easier
Ooh child things are gonna get brighter
And uh
To all the ladies havin babies on they own
I know its kinda rough and youre feelin all alone
Daddys long gone and he left you by ya lonesome
Thank the Lord for my kids even if nobody else want em
Cause I think we can make it in fact Im sure
And if you fall stand tall and comeback for more
Cause aint nothin worse than when your son
Wants to kno why his daddy dont love him no mo
You cant complain you was dealt this
Hell of a hand without a man feelin helpless
Because theres too many things for you to deal with
Dying inside but outside youre looking fearless
While tears is rollin down your cheeks
Ya steady hopin things dont all down this week
Cause if it did you couldnt take it and dont blame me
I was given this world I didnt make it
And now my sons gettin older and older and cold
From havin the world on his shoulders
While the rich kids is drivin Benz
Im still tryin to hold on to my survivin friends
And its crazy it seems itll never let up but
Please you got to keep your head upYou find an MC like me whos strong
Leaving motherfuckers aborted with no verbal support
And when I command the microphone I get deadly as Kahn though
With a bear and a snake and a panda Im on those
Who can withstand the more power I gain
And make it possible for me to drop a few to wreck your brain
Imagine and keep on wishing upon a star
Finally realizing who the fuck we are
When I penetrate its been withstanding faded
Would it be the greatest MC of all time
When I created rhyme for the simple fact
When I attack I crush your pride
My intention to ride every time all night
Im faced with the scars beyond this one bar
For me to put down my guard Im faced with it Im a ride
Breaking in gas with the six-eight all day
In and out with my pay
Im soon to count the bodies
So mandatory my elevation my lyrics like orientation
So you can be more familiar with the nigga you facing
We must be patient nothing better than communication
Known to damage and highly flammable like gas stations
Sorry I left that ass waiting
No more procrastination give up to fate and get that ass shaking
Im busting and making motherfuckers panic
Dont take your life for granted put that ass in the dirt
You swear the bitch was planted
My lyrics motivate the planet
Its similar to Rhythm Nation
But thugged out forgive me Janet
Whos in control Im activating your souls
You know the way the games get controlled
You two years ago a friend of mine
Told me Alize and Cristal blows your mind
Bear witness to the dopest fucking rhyme I wrote
Taking off my coat clearing my throat
I got my mind made up come on come on
Get in get in too get on it
Let it ride get wit it tonights the night
I got my mind made up come on
Get in get in too
Let it ride tonights the night
Well I come through with two packs
Of the bomb prophalaks for protection
So my fucking sac wont collapse
Cause nowadays shits evading the x-rays
Sending young motherfuckers to an early grave
I wonder if my terrifying tactics of torturing MCs
Shows my hearts as cold as the tundra
Electrifying like thunder Im just too much
Rough and raw with that motherfucking poisonous touch
Im an MC with lyrics thats the fucking bom-bay
Your got dissed thats before its ingest like balmay
My rhymes I leave a mark on your mind
As the deadly vibes spread through your head like sand pine
Theres no escape nah I aint blasting
I use my mental to assassinate assassins for those asking
Opposed to laughing raw maniacal villain
Laughter enhances the chances of the killing
Why is that cause smiling faces deceive
You best believe to MCs Im the deadliest disease
My thoughts rip your throat and make it hard to breathe
Your whole camps under seige and Im Jason Vorhees
In the heat of the night is when I defeat and ignite mikes
My verbal snipe your vocab on site
Im out the cut uncut and raw with no clause for all
So all my rhymes hit and split the bricks on the wall
Your already have an idea about the superior sphere
The greater rhyme creator on both sides of the equator
I rock from here to there to Philly and back
To LA on the spot where I rock and bust like straps
As your views get overshadowed when you come in contact
Beware set and prepare to enter verbal combat
Fuck you losers while you fake jacks I makes maneuvers
Like Hitler sticking up Jews with German lugers
The Mr Meth-Tical from Staten Isle
Will be back after this mess-age dont touch the dial
Rarely do you see an MC out for justice
Got my gun powder and my musket blow
Melons get swellings I paint mental pictures like Magellen
Half of my Clans three deep felons
Niggas best protect they joints for Nine-Nickel
Man I stay on point like icicles
Now who wanna test Tical then touch Tical
All up in your motherfucking mouth
Head banger boogie
Catch me on tour with Al Doogie
Method Man roll too tight you can pull me
Better take one and pass or thats that ass
Your vital statistics are low and falling fast
Johnny Blaze out to get loot like Johnny Cash
Play a game of Russian Roulette and have a blast
Hey yo lyrical gas spitting the criminal tactics
Non-believers get my dick and genitals backwards
Lets face it theres no replacement
Taste this mad underground basement shit Im laced with
Avalanche on your whole camp when Im splifted
Funk Doctor who Spock bitch dont get it twisted
I got connects like Federal Express
To get the fresh package of bless the dogs cant fetch
Got the clear spot from the rear block
To bust till every nigga here drop men I fear not
Hold your nose and blow out till your ears pop
Since your crew suit you to shift now you claim that you gets lot
With this underground cannabis
Im dangerous like John the bomb analyst
Then proceeds like keys
My degrees freeze consecutively like EPMD LPs
Lick off a shot and hit your fam by mistake
So I erase the whole front row at the wake
I planned my escape in case Jake or a snake bust it
Im the one pushing the hearse in the first place
Confidence for you shaky ass folks
Pump for Rockafella for the day he got smoked
Choke off this anecdote got you ope
Get roast by my lyrics Billy Dee forty-five Colt
And Im out for nine nickel INS the rebels
West list this this thisLookin for these better days
Better days heyy Better days
Got me thinkin bout better days
Better days Better days better days
Hey Better days
Got me thinkin bout better days
Time to question our lifestyle look how we live
Smokin weed like it aint no thang so even kids
Wanna try now they lie down and get ran through
Nobody watches em clockin the evil man do
Faced with the demons addicted to hearin victims screamin
Guess we was evil since birth product of cursed semens
Cause even our birthdays is cursed days
A born thug in the first place the worst ways
Id love to see the block in peace
With no more dealers and crooked cops the only way to stop the beast
And only we can change
Its up to us to clean up the streets it aint the same
Too many murders too many funerals and too many tears
Just seen another brother buried plus I knew him for years
Passed by his family but what could I say
Keep yo head up and try to keep the faith
And pray for better days
Better days better days hey
Better days got me thinkin about better days
Better days better days better days
Hey Better days
Got me thinkin about better days
Thinkin back as an adolescent who wouldve guessed
That in my future years Id be stressin
Some say the ghettos sick and corrupted
Plus my PO wont let me hang with the brothers I grew up with
Tryin to keep my head up and stay strong
All my homies slangin llello all day long but they wrong
So Im solo and so broke
Savin up for some Jordans cause they dope
I got a girl and I love her but she broke too and so am I
I cant take her to the place she wanna go to
So we argue and play fight all day and night
Makin passionate love til the daylight
Plus we about to get evicted cant pay the rent
Guess its time to see who really is yo friend
Tell me you pregnant and Im amazed
So many blessings while we stressin
Lookin for them better days
Lookin for better
Better days better days hey
Better days Oh better days
Thinkin bout better days Im lookin for better
Better days better days better days
Hey Better days Better days
Got me thinkin bout better days Oh
Now me and you was real cool hell on them square fools
Since back in high school we was true me and you
Hardly parted or seperated we stayed faded
Affiliated with gangbangers and still made it
Up in the gym mess with me gotta mess with him
Still dressin like grown men when rollin
I went to dark smokin Newports gamin marks
Got a place in my heart homey stay smart
Locked you up in the pen and gave you three to ten
I send you letters with naked flicks of old friends
Hopin you well I know its hell
Doin time in the cells you need mail when you in jail
And me Im doin cool
I settled down had a family workin in night school
Every once in a while I reminisce
And wonder how we ever came to this
I miss the better days
Lookin for better
Better days better days hey
Better days Thinkin bout better days
Better days better days better days
Hey Better days
Got me thinkin bout better days
I send this one out
To all the homeboys down in uh Clinton lockdown
Rikers Island all them dudes I was uh locked up with
E Block F Block lower H
N-I-C in Rikers Island
Downstate
All the peoples I met along the way
Better days is comin homeboy keep your head up
Better days better days
Lookin for the better days hey
Better days hm better days lookin for the better days
Better days better days
Lookin for the better days hey
Better daysI dont give a fuck
They done push me to the limit Im all in
I might blow up any minute did it again
Now Im in the back of the paddy wagon
While this cops bragging about the nigga hes jacking
I see no justice
All I see is niggas dying fast
The sound of a gun blast
Then watch the hearse past
Just another day in the life G
Gotta step lightly cause cops tried to snippe me
The catch they dont wanna stop at the brother man
But then theyll have an accident and pick up another man
I went to the bank to cash my check
I get more respect from the mother-fuckin dope man
The Grammys and the American music shows pimp us like hoes
They got dough but they hate us though
You better keep your mind on the real shit
And fuck trying to get with these crooked ass hypocrites
They way they see it we was meant to be keep down
Just cant understand why we getting respect now
Mama told me theyre be days like this
But Im pissed cause it stays like this
And now they trying to send me off to Kuwait
Gimme a break
How much shit can a nigga take
I aint goin nowhere no how
What you wanna throw down
Better bring your guns pal
Cause this is the day we make em pay
Fuck bailin hate I bail and spray with my A-K
And even if they shoot me down
Therell be another nigga bigger
From the mother-fuckin underground
So step but you better step quick
Cause the clocks goin tick and Im sick of the bullshit
Youre watching the makings of a physco-path
The truth didnt last
Before the wrath and aftermath
Whos that behind the trigger
Whod do your figure
A mother-fuckin night nigga
Ready to buck and rip shit up
I had enough and I dont give a fuck
Niggas isnt just the blacks
Also a gang of mother-fuckers dressed in blue slacks
They say niggas hang in packs and their attitude is shitty
Tell me whos the biggest gang of niggas in the city
They say niggas like to do niggas
Throw me in the cuffs with just two niggas
A street walkin nigga and a beat walkin nigga with a badge
I had to shoot you and the pass for the blast take his cash
And bash his head in dump him at the dead in
And thats just his luck
Cause a nigga like me
Dont really give a fuck
Walked in the store whats everybody staring at
They act like they never seen a mother fucker wearing black
Following a nigga and shit
Aint this a bitch
All I wanted was some chips
I wanna take my business else where
But where
Cause who in the hell cares
About a black man with a black need
They wanna jack me like some kind of crack fiend
I wonder if knows that my income is more than
His pension salary and then some
Your daughter is my number one fan
And your trife ass wife wants a life with a black man
So whos the mac in fact whos the black jack
Sit back and get fat off the fat cat
While he thinks that hes getting over
I bust a move as smooth as Casanova
And count another quick meal
Im getting paid for my traid but its still real
And if you look between the lines youll find a rhyme
AS strong as a fuckin nine
Mail stacked up niggas wanna act up
Lets put the gats up and throw your backs up
But the cops getting dropped by the gun shot
Usta come but hes done now we run the block
To my brothers stay strong keep your heads up
They know we fed up
But we they just dont give a fuck
They just dont give a fuck
I gotta give my fuck offs
Fuck you to the San Francisco police department
Fuck you to the Marin County Sheriff department
Fuck you to the FBI
Fuck you to the CIA
Fuck you to the B-u-s-h
Fuck you to the America
Fuck you to all you redneck prejudice mother fuckers
And fuck you
Fuck yall
Punk gay sensitive little dick bastards
twopacalypse mother fuckin know
Yall can kiss my ass and suck my dick
And my uncle Tommys balls
Fuck Yall
Punks punks punks punks punksEver since you was a pee-wee down by my knee with a wee-wee
We been coochie-coo all through school you and me G
Back in the days we played practical jokes on
Everybody smoked with they locs and the yolks on
All through high school girls by the dozens
Saying we cousins knowing that we wasnt
But like the old saying goes
Times goes on and everybody grows
Grew apart had to part went our own ways
You chose the dope game my microphone pays
In many ways we were paid in the old days
So far away from the crazies with AKs
And though I been around clowning with the Underground
Im still down with my homies from the hometown
And if you need need anything at all
I drop it all for yall if my homies call
Its a shame you chose the dope game
Now you slang cane on the streets with no name
It was plain that your aim was mo cane
You got game now you run with no shame
I chose rappin tracks to make stacks
In fact I travel the map with raps that spray cats
But now I dont wanna down my homie
No matter how low you go youre not lowly
And I hear that you made a few enemies
But when you need a friend you can depend on me call
If you need my assistance therell be no resistance
Ill be there in an instant
Who am I to judge another brother only on his cover
Id be no different than the other
H-to-the-O-to-the-M-to-the-I-to-the-E
Im down to the E-N-D
Cause its a fall in no time at all
Im down for yall when my homies call
Word if my homies call
Well its ninety-one and Im living kinda swell now
But I hear that youre going through some hell pal
But life making records aint easy
It aint what I expected its hectic its sleazy
But I guess that the streets is harder
Trying to survive in the life of a young godfather
My homies is making it elsewhere
Striving working nine to five with no health care
We both had dreams of being great
But his deferred and blurred and changed in shaped
Its fate it wasnt my choice to make
To be great Im giving it all it takes
Trying to shake the crates and fakes and snakes
I gotta take my place or fall from grace
The foolish way the pace is quick and great
Smiling face to hide the trace of hate
But my homie would never do me wrong
Thats why I wrote this song if you ever need me its on
No matter who the foe they must fall
Us against them all Im down to brawl if my homies callphone beeps as its dialed
Whats ya phone number
Now I can make miracles with pimp hoes its instrumental
Waitin for the nymphos thats the intro
Shook when ya rushed me you walked up and touched me
Why Do you want to fuck me
Just cause Im paid in the worst way True
Lookin kind of good in your birthday suit
I wonder if youre wild or ya act shy
Do you like to be on top or the back side
Watch when you lick yo lips shake yo hips
God damn I love that shit
Now lets stop fake and be real now
I got a room and a hard-on still down
Met ya standin at a bar full of black dudes
Say you want to see my scar and my tattoos
When we headed for my hideout act right
Boss playa when I ride out thats right
Whats ya phone number
If you really want to fuck with me Im ready
Baby let me give you a call
How long will it take to break you off
Oh shit - baby is a dime piece more than just fine
Shes personally blessed from the Gods if I seen it right
Now she could get me - hard
Didnt want to talk to me til she seen my car
Never had sex with a rich rap star
til I got her in the back of my homeboys car
Tell me why do we live this way
Money over bitches let me hear you say
Whats yo phone number Are you alone
Got a pocket full of rubbers lets bone
Time to tell your girlfriend to take you home
I had fun but baby gotta leave me alone
Picture my rhyme take time to rewind
these ordinary words I say
If you open your mind bet a minute youll find
its time let the Outlawz play
Whats yo phone number
phone rings

Are you afraid to die or do you wanna live forever
Tell me which one
They wanna bury me Im worried -- Im losin my mind
Look down the barrel of my nine and my visions blurry
Fallin to pieces am I guilty I pray to the Lord
But he ignores me unfortunately cause Im guilty
Show me a miracle Im hopeless -- Im chokin off
Marijuana smoke with every toke its like Im losin focus
Fallin to sleep while Im at service when will I die
Forever paranoid and nervous because Im high
Dont mention funerals Im stressin and goin nutty
And reminiscin bout them niggas that murdered my buddy
I wonder when will I be happy aint nothin funny
Flashbacks of bustin caps anything for money
Where am I goin I discovered cant nothin save me
My next door neighbors havin convo with undercovers
Put a surprise in the mailbox hope she get it
Happy birthday bitch you know you shouldnta did it
Everybodys dyin am I next who can I trust
Will they be Gs and they look at me before they bust
Or will they kill me while Im sleepin two to the head
While Im in bed leakin blood on my satin sheets
Is there a heaven for a baller Im gettin suspicious
Of this bitch the line busy everytime I call her
Now shes tellin me to visit who else is home
I check the house before I bone so we all alone
After I nut I hit the highway see ya later
To all the players watch the fly way a nigga played her
The bitch is tellin all her homies -- that I can fuck her
Like no other now them other bitches wanna bone me
Im under pressure gettin drunk somebody help me
I drink a fifth of Hennesey I dont think its healthy
I see my enemies they creepin dont make me blast
I watch the five-ohs roll the motherfuckers pass
By me like they know me smilin as they laugh
I put up my middle finger then I dash
Niggas dont like me cause Im Thuggin and every day
Im a hustler lookin to get paid
They wanna bury me Im worried -- no need to lie
I pray to God I dont scream when its time to fry
Nowhere to rest Im losin homies aint that a bitch
When I was rich I had clout now a niggas lonely
I put the pistol to my head and say a prayer
I see visions of me dead Lord are you there
Then tell me am I lost cause Im lonely
I thought I had friends but in the end a nigga dies lonely
Nowhere to run Im in terror and no one cares
A closed casket at my funeral and no ones there
Is there a future for a killer I change my ways
But still that dont promise me the next day
So I stay Thuggin with a passion forever blastin
Im bustin on these motherfuckers in my madness
They wonder if Im hellbound well Hell
Cant be worse than this cause Im in Hell now
Dont make me hurt you I dont want to but I will
Seen motherfuckers killed over phone bills
Never will I die Ill be back
Reincarnated as a motherfuckin mack
Eleven cause in heaven theres no shortage on Gs
Im tellin you now you motherfuckers dont know me
Only fear of death You ghetto niggas
Only fear of death is comin back reincarnated
repeats continously w variations
Hahaha I aint scared to die
I aint scared to die
To my homies in heaven
I aint scared to die
Do you wanna live forever
Are you scared to die
Or will you scream when you fry
I dont fear death
My only fear of death is comin back reincarnated
This is dedicated to Mental RIP
And Big Kato RIP
And all you other OGs who go down
I dont fear deathYo Law
Is it cool if a nigga just get fucked up for this one
Yeah Mr Fuck-a-Cop is BACK
And I still dont give a fuck yaknahmsayin
Puffin on this indo in the studio with my partners out here
Pacific Heights in the house know what I mean
I was framed so dont make the same mistake nigga
You gotta learn how to shake the snakes nigga
Cause the police love to break a nigga
Send em upstate cause they straight-up hate the niggas
So what I do is get a crew of zoo niggas
Straight fools into rules and do niggas
And one-time had enough of me
Im still raw so the law cant fuck with me
They wanna send me to the pen punk picture that
I stay strapped motherfuckers better get your gat
It aint easy bein me I cant take it
Life as a celebrity aint everything they make it
And ever since the movies these hoes try to do me
If they cant screw me they find a way to sue me
Now can you picture me coolin at a night club
Nothin but love but motherfuckers wanna mean mug
Since I wear a lot of gold they plot
Dont know what I got and get shot with the hot ones
And aw yeah I wanna feel guilty
But you punk motherfuckers tried to milk me
Youll get smacked behind the hill with my phone on my pager
Its beepin while I cut you with my razor
Im not violent Im petrified and nervous
I got no mercy for these niggas tryin to serve us
But if you catch me outta pocket then Im got
You love to shoot a nigga but you scared to pop a cop
Now drop it
Chorus
Strictly for my strictly for my strictly for my niggas
Strictly for my strictly for my strictly for my niggas
Strictly for my strictly for my strictly for my niggas
Strictly for my niggas makin Gs
Reflected and disrespected plus Im rejected
Youre just another rapper who swears hes makin records
Thats what they said whenever I would walk by
I never tripped though always kept my head up high
Eventually I knew that I would find my way
After the darkest night always comes a brighter day
And some would say that turned away is all youll get
I just said bet and never let em see me sweat
Cause in the end I knew that I would have it all
While non-believers were prayin for my downfall
And some would call and tell me that they wish me well
But in my heart Im knowin that they wish me hell
Yo get a real job rappin doesnt pay the rent
I hate the studio cause thats where all my money went
Never surrender its all about the faith youve got
Dont ever stop just push it til you hit the top
And if you drop at least you know you gave your all
Be true to you and that way you can never fall
But beware these backstabbers aint no joke
Just like a rope they hang on you until youre broke
And when youre broke they move onto the next dope
And there you are cant even pay your car nope
And when you reminisce thinkin how you got dissed
Remember how it felt and then remember this
Be true to you believe that theres no one bigger
Cause they can all suck dick its strictly for my niggas
Chorus
This is This is for the critics if you live up
Pick up my shit or Ill be back doin stickups
I better see five stars next to my picture
If not Tupac will cop the glock and come knockin to getcha
I told you once motherfucker Im a nut
Play me like a butt and youll be bleedin when youre fucked
Niggas know whats up but they be tryin to hold me down
Im comin outta Oaktown bitch fuck around
And it aint where you from that makes you hardcore
Nigga its the way you throw them thangs in the war
And to the marks that be talkin all that shit
Screamin out the next niggas name like a bitch
And the niggas that I ran into recently
The motherfuckers at the club that pulled the piece on me
You little bitches shoulda pulled the fuckin trigga
Now you live in fear of a heartless-ass nigga
Mr Troublesome niggas tried to play me with the gat
But like Terminator nigga Ill be back
Yeah And Ill be back with a fuckin army
You tried to harm me- ruh-ring the alarm G
Cause most motherfuckers love to act up
Without they backup when they get jacked up they crack up
Its strictly for my niggas at the show
So they know not to play me like a ho ho
Strictly for my
Chorus Yeah
Clear enough for ya Yea right
Why you niggas look mad
Yall supposed to be happy Im free
Yall niggas look like yall wanted me to stay in jail
Ho bustas
Picture me rolling in my five hundred Benz
I got no love for these niggas theres no need to be friends
They got me under surveillance thats what somebody be telling
Know theres dope being sold but I aint the one selling
Dont want to be another number
I gotta puff a gang of weed to keep from going under
The federales wanna see me dead
Niggas put prices on my head
Now I got two Rottweilers by me bed I feed em lead
Now Im released how will I live
Will God forgive me for all the dirt a nigga did to feed kids
One life to live its so hard to be positive
When niggas shooting at your crib
Mama Im still thugging the world is a war zone
My homies is inmates and most of them dead wrong
Full grown finally a man just scheming on ways
To put some green inside the palms of my empty hands
Just picture me rollin
Flossing a Benz on rims that isnt stolen
My dreams is censored my hopes are gone
Im like a fiend that finally sees when all the dope is gone
My nerves is wrecked heart beating and my hands are swollen
Thinking of the Gs Ill be holdin picture me rollin

So I got to floss cause Im more like a boss player
Thug branded to be a women-layer
So many player haters imitators steady swanging
Make me wanna start back banging
So Im caught up in the game dress code changed
Packing forty Glocks contain em or rearrange
All that jealousy and envy coming from my enemies
While Im sipping on Remy
In front of black Lexus Chevys on the roam
ninety-six Big body sitting on chrome
As we head up out the zone stone-facing is on

Wicked wicked this way comesWhen your hero falls from grace all fairy tales are uncovered
Myth exposed and pain magnified the grace pays uncovered
He told me to be strong but I confused to see it so weak
You say never to give up and it hurts to see what comes to be
When your hero falls soley the stars and so does the reception of tomorrow
Without my hero theres only me alone to deal with my sorrow
Your heart ceases to work and your soul is not happy at all
What are you expected to do when your only hero falls
As long as some suffer the river flows forever
As long as there is pain the river flows forever
As strong as a smile can be the river will flow forever
And as long as you are with me well ride the river together
And as long as you are with me well ride the river together
Well ride the river together as long as you are with me
The river will flow forever as long as you are with me
The river will flow forever as long as you are with meTell me baby are you lonely Dont wanna rush ya
I can help ya if ya only let me touch ya
If Im wrong love tell me cause I get caught up
And the life I live is Hell see I never thought Id see
The day when I would calm down you aint heard
Ive been known to clown and Get Around thats my word
See you walkin and you lookin good yes indeed
Got a body like a sex fiend youre killin me
With your attitude to match right dont be phony
Cause I hate when you act like you dont know me
Ive be stressin in the spotlight I want the fame
But the industrys a lot like a crap game
Aint no time for commitment I gotta go
Cant be with you every minute miss another show
And even though Im known for my one night stand
Look here I wanna be an honest man but temptations go
Throw up the finger And all my homies go
Throw them the finger Ya know what baby its like
I know youve been searchin for someone
To make you happy and get the job done
You say you needed a man with money
But I cant be there and will you still care
Will I cheat or will I be committed heaven knows
Gettin weak and I wanna hit it so here I go
In my ride and Im all in gettin high
I can hear the people callin Im passin by
Everybody knows Im ballin and to God
Gotta keep myself from fall-in but its hard
All the cuties know Im under pressure what do I do
Gettin shaky when she pull the dress up and say its cool
Should I stroke or should I wait a while you decide
If you tell me that you dont want it thats a lie
Move close and let me whisper some dirty words
In your ears as I kiss ya on every curve
Slow down baby dont rush I like it slow
Cant hold it any longer so let it go
Open the gates to your waterfall up in heaven
And dont worry I let myself in all I heard was
Give em the finger
All my homies go throw your fingers up
Thats just the Thug in me girl you know
Peep out all my homies yknow its like
I know youve been searchin for someone
To make you happy and get the job done
You say you needed a man with money
But I cant be there and will you still care
A lotta people think its easy to settle down
Got a woman thatll please me in every town
I dont wanna but I gotta do it the temptation
Got me ready to release the fluid sensation
Sit down and conversate like you know me take my hand
Cause even Thugs get lonely understand
Even the hardest of my homies need attention
Catch you blowin up the telephone reminiscin
I wanna take you to the movies and the park
Lets find a spot for you to do me in the dark
Now that its passion hold me tight

Talkin to some nigga bout his car
I guess he said he had a Lexus whats next
You headin to his car for some sex
I pass by cant hold back tears inside
Cause Lord knows for years I tried
And all the other people on my block hate your guts
Then you wonda why they stare and call you slut
Its like your mind dont understand
You dont have to kill your dreams plotting schemes on a man
Keep your head up legs closed eyes open
Either a nigga wear a rubber or he die smokin
Im hearin rumors so you need to switch
And niggas wouldnt call you bitch I betcha
You wonda why they call you bitch
I guess times getting hard even harder for you cause hey now
Got a baby on the way now
More money from the county and thanks to the welfare
Youre about to get your hair done
Got a dinner date cant be late
Trick or treat sweet thing got another trick to meet
The way he did it it was smooth plotting while he gaming you
So baby peep the rules
I shouldve seen it in the first case the worst case
I shouldve never called you back in the first place
I remember back in high school baby you was fast
Straight sex when you moved your ass
But now things change cause you dont look the same
Let the ghetto get the best of you baby thats a shame
Caught HIV and now you bout to be deceased
And finally be in peace
So where your niggas at now cause everybody left
They stepped and left you on your own
See I loved you like a sister but you died to quick
And thats why we called you bitch I betchaStand in formation my motherfuckin real troopers
Lets do it like soldiers all and together now
Ready Hell yeah yall niggas better get ready
No retreat no surrender death before dishonor motherfucker
Do it to em cmon never die thuggin uhh yes yes yes
Say what Eastside Westside ride Where ya at where ya at
Where my real thugs where ya at where ya at
Where my real thugs where ya at where ya at
Where my real thugs where ya at
Send cases to the drug dealer
Real thugs where ya at You motherfuckin home
Do it to em do it to em
They love the way we do it to em we do it to em
Some press the revolution of premeditated scheme
Introduce a drug called crack to us ghetto teens
Got a law for raw niggas now playa what it be like
When will niggas see they got us bleedin with three strikes
Cant seem to focus hopeless with violent thoughts I wrote this
Got these Devils petrified hidin from my hocus-pocus
And so I learned to earn my currency and over time
Affiliated clearly click a military mind
May God forgive us though we dwell inside a paradox
Thugged out and drug dealin from the womb to the block
My life mind got me survivin five rounds
My forty-five got my fortified with live rounds
When shits thick we plot hits when our glock spits
All hail out on bail raps the twoPacalypse
Forever ghetto necessary picture food stamps
Outlaw Thug Niggas never left the boot camp
They called us for assignment one of the squads finest
Skills in guerilla warfare and blessed with refinement
My rap sheet contains sections of bomb sessions
Says Im responsible for black Smif-N-Wessun
Puttin likkle youts in a military state of mind
Dangerous like chronic and yard when combined
Cocoa Brovaz pon de borderline
Test de sound and ye dead same time
Man to man Im facin the Devil with a plan
Judo stance first glance Im makin my advance
Animal instincts intelligence of an assassin
Masked men ninjas that surround me ready to attack
I react swiftly what father taught me sticks with me
Never forget the method stick and move strictly
Shit be seemin like its closin in
With no regrets I hold position
Cause I suppose Im one of the chosen men
Picture bein put in a position to move
And you cant move cause your move is blocked by the knight
At twelve oclock thats when the madness begins
So I start to focus in my thoughts on the war
Cause the rule is the law and the law that we live by
Is to stay true to self in this case BDI
Why try if ya body lie
By the block true soldier mentality this is how we rock and roll
This is how we ride
Stick and move time to show em how to make a move
Or get moved on lets see who strong
In the gaze of the strange where nothin stays the same
Where new faces come through with similar game
Now who you thought was them really aint they
Catchin dejavus of the game people play
Its a call for readjustment fine tune yo position
You slippin and trippin stead of bobbin and dippin
But never let this world of stress get the best of me
Takin breathin techniques slay you with Tai-Chi
What does it take to get a break in the world of snakes
And dose who fake elimination Im facin destruction
Outlawed so I duck and down
Fo-fo is bustin no one to trust in
Rushin to the goal line
Catch a nigga beat him treat him like he stole him
No swine Im a soldier soldier I control mine
Time to take you back into time follow dis here
One way out this black hole
For this black soul shit is outta control
Im fightin for my position to be a fetus in this world Im enterin
And my face is sentencin for repentance
Before my body was fully formed into a human
I was already consumin weed
Cause my moms used to smoke back in the seventys
Maybe thats why in the ninetys I drop Gs when I drop degrees
When I ease across the block with Pac
Got all yall niggas shocked
You didnt think Boot Camp Clik would link with a Outlaw mind
If you do you press rewind
And you can peep guerilla tactics in every line
Yeah and this is how we do it
Where my real thugs where they at
Let me see my real thugs now where ya at
Wontcha see my real thugs where ya at
Let me see my real thugs where ya at now
Where my real thugs let me see where ya at
Tell me where my real thugs gotsta see where ya at
Wheres my soldiers where ya at
Where my real soldiers where ya at
Where my soldiers at where ya at where ya at
Get yo strap my nigga where ya at where ya at
Where my soldiers at where ya at what ya at
Getcha thug niggas where ya at witcha strap

Where my soldiers at no longer drug dealers

Where my soldiers at Put your pistols in the air
Where my soldiers at Put yo guns up
Tell me where my soldiers at Put yo pistols in the air
Where my soldiers my true thug rollers

We gonna do it like this
Anytime your ready check it
I got seven Mac elevens about eight

You cant touch my riches even if you had
MC Hammer and them three hundred and fifty-seven bitches
Biggie Smalls the millionaire the mansion the yacht
The two weed spots the two hot Glocks
Thats how I got the weedspot
I shot dread in the head took the bread and the Lamb spread
Little Gotti got the shotty to your body
So dont resist or you might miss Christmas
I tote guns I make number runs

When I throw my clip in the AK

Everybody hit the D-E-C-K
My slow flows remarkable peace to Matteo
Now we smoke weed like Tony Montana sniffed the yayo

My voice excels from the avenue to jail cells

I thank the Lord for my many blessings though Im stressin
Keep a vest for protection from the barrel of a Smith Wesson
And all my niggas in the pen here we go again
Aint nuttin separatin us from a MacK ten
Born in the ghetto as a hustler hold up
A straight soldier bucking at the busters
No matter how you try niggas never die
We just retaliate with hate then we multiply
You see me striking down the block hitting corners
Mobbing like a motherfucker living like I - wanna
And aint no stopping at the red lights Im sideways
Thug Life motherfucker crime pays
Let the cops put they lights on chase me nigga

fades outIn the event of my demise
when my heart can beat no more
I hope I die for a principle
Or a belief that I have lived for
I will die before my time
Because I feel the shadows depth
So much I wanted to accomplish
Before I reached my death
I have to come to grips with the possibility
And wiped the last tear from my eyes
I loved all who were positive
In the event of my demise
In the event of my demise dont shed no tear
Ill share my wisdom with the world theyll know I was here
Know I was clear every thing I said I meant
A outlaw when I was born they prepared my ditch
Said I wont live long statistic showed
Im tryna past twenty-four realistic goal listen all
You gotta stay cold inside
Thats what I tell myself when I feel alone sometime
But I cant cry I dont tear no more
I love god from death I dont fear no more
A part taken in this movement to better my people
Though they see me on TV I tell them we equal
Dont look at me as a stranger Im one of your own
We was rised in concrete and grew as a rose
Still I rise but never get a chance to fly
Mama please dont cry
In the event of my demise
In the event of my demise
cant breathe no more
hope I die for a principle
something I lived for
dying before my time
feel the shadows of depth
Trying to fulfill all my dreams before I reach my death
came to grips with the possibility
The worlds killing me and my soldiers die young with no sympathy
I wipe the last tear from my eyes
I loved all who stand strong
In the event of my demise
If I should die before I awake
let my family be straight of the money I make
Give my son what he needs other than his father
Is it self respect better get his honor
with the law come to swallow my soul its so big
Cause the street took enough of my life we all see
Its a cycle make you feel psycho
Everything struggles behind this man see nobody love you
Got a piece of the streets and its gonna die with me
may your soul forgive me
Makavelis within me
In principle we stand by stronger than power
We gon die by the rules you can never devour
On the earth from my birth fell nothing but pain
Only thing I ever gave was the baby the name
Thats my heart and if I should go Ill go on in sparks
Thats the event of my demise and it lurks in the dark
Chorus
Now as I stand here a man here
Not a perfect one but a searching one
Seek in another blazing time
Sound crazy but Im actually tryin to escape my mind
Tryna rise in time
but hoping that you didnt notice
When i was at my low as
So I knew they were watching I couldnt stop it
So many things I wanted to accomplish
Too many dreams wasted with no promise
From out the darkness I struggle to see the light
Rumble deep in the night
Hustlin with all of my might
Some wont see it that way
But us is given praise
But all of them will dream
That I did it my way
In the event of my demise
I was born to a storm that wont lead up
And I was raised to stay brave with my head up
But thing aint got better
We still gettin wetter in this bad weather
I need more than a sweater and a leather
Yo aint nothin meant to last forever
So the struggling and the starving aint gon last forever
And my will probably be like two lines long
It will read Im dead but my soul lives on
And my spirit still living though my body is gone
In the event of my demise I love all who stay strong
I love all who stay strong
In the event of my demise comon
In the event of my demise
when my heart can beat no more
I hope I die for a principle
Or a belief that I have lived for
I will die before my time
Because I feel the shadows depth
So much I wanted to accomplish
Before I reached my death
I have to come to grips with the possibility
And wiped the last tear from my eyes
I loved all who were positive
In the event of my demiseYeah we goin platinum nigga Platinum

Than a lot of cops I cant be stopped till my head gets popped
A lot of fuckin bodies will drop

Blowin em out the frame with no shame
Game tight drop a body then get out of sight

And always keep a hand on the gat
Cause a niggas straight strugglin
I used to be on tour but now Im sick of strugglin
I thought about bumpin but mother-fuck jugglin
I know it lasts longer gets my pockets thicker
But Id rather use my gun cause I get the money quicker so bust it
Look as I cut the records hard to eject
A quick clip threw my body down uh its another hit

But rugged and rough is how Im steppin
Mac is the weapon and its always kept in
Eye on the Mac cause the dogg got it goin on
If you come up steppin youll be lit like a hick
So you better chill cause I got too much money to get
A street thug in the motherfuckin house Im strugglin
Get drunk but I dont think
Im just in it for the money dont be a punk snitch
When I yank up my gun dont run dont bitch
Cause ya know if you do youll be layin in a ditch
Youll get your stupid ass blown out the frame
Cause Im playing to win and survive in the game

Big up big up got him in the frame bang
Aint nothin changed set it off I let the brains hang
Guess whos back to put niggas on they back
Till I call back niggas runnin free better fall back

Three deep in my Jeep chief run with the Young Gunz
Strugglin and strivin thats how the dough come

I aint got time for bitches bitchesStaring at the world through my rear view
Just looking back at the world from another level
Ya know what I mean
Starin
Multiple gunshots fill the block the fun stops
Niggaz is callin cops people shot nobody stops
I wonder when the world stopped caring last night
Two kids shot while the whole block staring
I will never understand this society first they try
To murder me then they lie to me product of a dying breed
All my homies trying weed now the little babys
Crazed raised off Hennesey tell me will my enemies
Flee when they see me believe me
Even Thugs gotta learn to take it easy listen
Through the intermissions search your heart for a plan
And we turnin Bad Boys to grown men its on again
I give a holla to my niggaz in the darkest corners
Roll a perfect blunt and let me spark it for ya
One love from a thug nigga rollin with a posse
Full of paranoid drug dealers to the end my friend
Repeat 
Im seein nuttin but my dreams comin true
While Im starin at the world through my rearview see
Repeat 
They got me starin at the world through my rear view
Go on baby scream to God he cant hear you
I can feel your heart beatin fast cause its time to die we
Gettin high watchin time fly and all my motherfuckers
Now you see him now you dont some niggaz
Be here for the moment and then they gone what happened to em
Well lets see it seems to be a mystery
But all I know I never let the money get to me
Stay down like the truest
Thug Life until I check out this bitch I thought you knew this
Who is gonna catch me when I fall or even care to
While you thinkin I see you lost up in my rear view
Half you is down with them Outlawz
Outcast left far Im through like southpaws
But still we keep mÃshin til our dreams come through
Starin at the world through my rear view
Now I was raised as a young black male
In order to get paid forced to make crack sales
Caught a nigga so they send me to these over packed jails
In the cell countin days in this livin black Hell do you feel me
Keys to ignition use at your discretion
Roll with a twelve gauge pump for protection
Niggaz hate me in the section from years of chin checkin
Turn to Smith and Wesson war weapons
Heavenly Father Im a soldier Im gettin hotter
Cause the worlds gettin colder baby let me hold ya
Talk to my guns like they fly bitches
All you bustas best to run look at my bitches
Repeat 
Now I know the answers to the question do dreams come true
Still starin at the world through my rear view I say
Repeat 
They got me starin at the world through my rear view
Go on baby scream to God he cant hear you
I can feel your heart beatin fast cause its time to die
Gettin high watchin time fly
And all my motherfuckers nigga can die
Back in the days we hustled for sneakers and beepers
Nine-six for glocks cause fiends hittin up blocks with street sweepers
Bless myself when knowin rules to these streets somethin I learned
In school on some Million Man March shit for the piece
True that only one life to lead a fast life of greed
Criminally addicted infested since a seed
We all die breed bleed like humans towns run
By young guns Outlawz and truants shits deep
Turn eighteen burn my will when I go
Burnt my body with my shotty or chosin my dough
So while you reminiscing all nights out with the crew
Smoke a blunt for me too Im starin through your rear view
Ha ha ha ha you aint knowin what we mean by starin through the rear view
So since you aint knowin what we mean let me break down understandin
The world the world is behind us
Once a motherfucker get an understanding on the game
And what the levels and the rules of the game is
Then the world aint no trick no more
The world is a game to be played
So now we lookin at the world from like behind us
Niggaz know what we gotta do just gotta put our mind to it and do it
Its all about the papers money rule the world
Bitches make the world go round
Real niggaz do they wanna do bitch niggaz do what they cant
Repeat 
Starin at the world through my rear view
Go on baby scream to God he cant hear you
I can feel your heart beatin fast cause its time to die
Gettin high watchin time fly ya know and well beHome man hey lets turn this house into a happy home

Now weve been kickin it for quite some time
Remained beside me through my trials in this life of crime
We divorced so many times I forgot to count
I never hit you not a coward rather leave your house
Remember back in December when we was tight
Sippin Alize and Cristal whylin every night in my bedroom
Promised that I commit to you soon
Tongue-kissed me every time you seen me step inside a room
Straight out the hood
We promised to be good to each other plus I love you
So I know you gon make a good mother
Just try to understand if I change at times
Its only cause I never owned anything thats mine
So Im tryin you can stay with my momma but keep the drama to a low
Never call the police I never call you bitch and ho
We were all born hungry in this world alone
Finally moved out my moms house and got a happy home
Happy home lets turn this house into a happy home
Happy home finally made it out my moms house got a happy home
Happy home turn this house into a happy home
Happy home
Goin through hard times ghetto child of mine
I wonder if you have to suffer for your fathers crimes
To be honest its a hard road
Just keep your faith in God knowin youll get scarred though
Look at him walkin and talkin a lil child with my eyes and mouth
Father watch over lil seeds help me guide them out
Had to change my whole lifestyle married my babys momma
Made her my wife now Im tryin hard yall
Maybe in time Ill be a better man
Watchin the older couples handle it like veterans
Show me the meaning of forever and together we rise
If it would help our child grow then together wed die
Why question my love its so easy to see
Without my family all Im left with is a shadow of me
After all the arguments and the nights alone
Now its time to live the good life inside a happy home
Happy home lets turn this house into a happy home
Happy home finally made it out my moms house got a happy home
Happy home turn this house into a happy home
Happy home

Shit half the times we flaunt cause trouble
My closest road dog it was cool cause I love you
Fuck what they talkin bout
Let me take you back in time rewind to eighty-nine
Introduced me to this life of crime but we was blind
Little nappy-haired juveniles livin wild
No smiles on our faces thirteen catchin cases
Indeed it was misery
Driven by my own demons cause they was killin me
How can I be sure Ill be saved soon
Catch me dip into the light of a stray moon
Its gettin deeper now let me get yo mind right
Fuck yo enemies nigga grip yo nine tight tonights the night
Murder murder Mr Lucifer

Runnin from the future escapin in the fog
Live yo life like a hog nigga me and my closest road dogz
Every ghetto street got a crosswalk
Let me get to the other side with my road dogz

Take a second victim and if they all gone my closest road dogz

They could never take the soul of a MOB soldier nigga
Cowards get rolled up mob on em Makaveli
Boy youse a boss player thats what all the bitches tell me
Even if I died now

Fooled a few but never came a gamer aint tryin to hear it
Evil spirits hide at total strangers yo lifes in danger
Prepare nigga be aware cause we aint scared
MOB til I die when we ride niggas disappear
Fill em up with pistol smoke
Never forget to blow a hole in his head
For leakin information to the feds
The burnin bed was the tellin sign
Two hired guns bustin everyone yellin everybody die
Why the fuck they fuck around we left em in the fog
Bleedin like a stuck hog me and my closest road dogz
Every ghetto street got a crosswalk

See me in physical form my niggas swarm
Take the figure of a circle beatin jealous niggas til they purple
Simon Says take they heads homies
And send them phony motherfuckers to dwell with all they dead homies
Fishin for fake niggas observe and shake niggas
The only way to see six figures is break niggas
Me and Musolini set to ride we high
Big Bogart got the alibi if homicide ask us way
Labelled a Capo in the mob as big as the globe
To live and die as a millionaire on
Set to explode my MO is kill them hoes

God bless the dead
God bless the dead and buried nigga
Dont worry if you see God first
Tell him shit got worse I aint mad
I know you representin the crew
And I can picture you in heaven with a blunt and a brew
Fuck the world pain was a part of the game
If you a baller money went as quick as it came
My role models gone or they locked in the pen
Straight hustlers caught up in the whirlwind
The other day I thought I seen my homeboy Biggy
Sayin shit dont stop nigga no pity
We all hoods and all we ever had was dreams
Money makin motherfuckers plot scandalous schemes
In the gutter you learn to have a criminal mind
I was addicted to tryin never meant to do time
My epitaph will read was the last of Gs
Kicked the shit to make the white man bleed
God bless the dead thats right thats right
God bless the dead yeah dont stop
God bless the dead
God bless the dead
Man aint nobody promised me a thang
I been caught up in this game
Ever since I was a little motherfucker wantin to hang
I can see em in my head pow
Memories of my nigga but he dead now
Lookin back in my yearbook all the years took
Half my peers theyre stretched for years
And if I die will they all shed tears
Two to the dome leave me alone let me get my head clear
Paranoid got me lookin in the mirror
Behind me life without my nine Id rather do the time
See Im old enough to know that aint no justice
And all the courts same way they fucked us
And why the hell am I locked in jail
They let them white boys free we be shocked as hell
In my mind I can see it comin
And all the time its a plot to keep a nigga runnin
I keep a gun and never run unless Im comin at ya
Cry later but for now lets enjoy the laughter
God bless the dead thats right thats right
God bless the dead
God bless the dead Yeah rest in peace to all the motherfuckers that passed too early
All the young motherfuckers that was took in they prime God bless the dead

Niggas terrified of drama from the young gun
Hearin that they did it outta fear dont amaze me

One Nation under a thug and bullet scar
Young nation no revolution and no cause
One Nation young black and dangerous by far
Young nation just trying to get this
Murderous mind state
Cant keep my nine straight
Sippin on this Hennessy waiting for the time to break
Show up and motherfuckas bow down recognize
Westside Death Row Outlaw Ridaz
Untouchable mob of pistol packers
Well-known felons labeled for drug-selling merciless jackers
Forever buzz roll with thugs and dogs
Commence the letting off rounds then escape in the fog
Who wants to see me solo
Catch Makaveli while he sleeping
My mini fourteen murdering niggaz while they creepin Uh
Duck cause you ass out
Drink til you pass out

Niggas is playa haters label them my enemies

One Nation under a thug and bullet scar
Young nation no revolution and no cause
One Nation young black and dangerous by far
Young nation just trying to get this
When its on Im poppin off every chance I get
Out the window on some uptown anthem shit
Im stressin but aint no pressure I been here before
Fugitive task force at my girlfriends door
Now they checkin in her bedroom I aint there
Forty Cals extended clips still I aint scared
Outlaw and best believe they wont take me alive
Im different and Imma prove it if it take me to die
You think God had a plan for me
But he wont be layin up in my casket or doin life in the can for me
Maybe Im brazen or paranoid than a bitch
Me dyin you think Id let him see the joy from that shit
Walking dead angels spend their last days by me
New Jersey Giant like Dave Tyree
Young George or Jonathan Chat
Your guns clap
Mine will go br-r-r-r-att
Soldier like Geronimo Pratt
And come through cockin tha black pound
When they put the twin towers up
Pac Im knockin em back down
Poster child
Air Force Ones with the checks
Im supposed to wild sex
Money and murder is all I breathe in my life
Its full of judges and chasin enemies in the night
Through the Henny I see the eyes of the Devil
Hes ridin with extra boxes of bullets and a nina and a shovel
Who you are
One Nation under a thug and bullet scar
Young nation no revolution and no cause
One Nation young black and dangerous by far
Young nation just trying to get this
I always thought Id have to die to do a record with Pac
So I wrote from the perspective of a graveyard box
You end up in the box cause them grave robbin bastards
Dig your grave up and snatched you out the casket
Worms in my eyes eating through my cabbage
The flesh to the bones
The bones to the ashes
But Im not dead
Im actually in a session
With the Pac Keeper Sha Money progressing
They dont really want no drama I know they goons
Thats why I keep pressure on em like a open wound
This God given he keep givin me better music
So every time you hear me my songs present improvement
Yall cant kill me yall forever losin
Songs of evolution
If I load your gun for you
And we bang it out with some other niggas
You better shoot it
Dont try to lie and say you was bustin Im clever stupid
Claimin you reppin Ruthless
You got the same bullets you had
When I loaded it for you you never used it
The Nasareema dream get ready for execution
Papoose Fatal and Pac
The revolution
Who you are
One Nation under a thug and bullet scar
Young nation no revolution and no cause
One Nation young black and dangerous by far
Young nation just trying to get this
Young nation just trying to get this
Just trying to get thisKilling us one by one
In one way or another
American will find a way to eliminate the problem
One by one
The problem is
The troubles in the black youth of the ghettos
And one by one
We are being wiped off the face of this earth
At an extremely alarming rate
And even more alarming is the fact
That we are not fighting back
Brothers sistas niggas
When I say niggas it is not the nigga we are grown to fear
It is not the nigga we say as if it has no meaning
But to me
It means Never Ignorant Getting Goals Acomplishes nigga
Niggas what are we going to do
Walk blind into a line or fight
Fight and die if we must like niggas
This is for the masses the lower classes
The ones you left out jobs were givin better livin
But we were kept out
Made to feel inferior but were the superior
Break the chains in out brains that made us fear yeah
Pledge allegiance to a flag that neglects us
Honor a man that who refuses to respect us
Emancipation proclamation Please
Nigga just said that to save the nation
These are lies that we all accepted
Say no to drugs but the governments keep it
Running through our community killing the unity
The war on drugs is a war on you and me
And yet they say this is the Home of The Free
But if you ask me its all about hypocrisy
The constitution Yo it dont apply to me
Lady Liberty still the bitch lied to me
Steady strong nobodys gonna like what I pumpin
But its wrong to keeping someone from learning something
So get up its time to start nation building
Im fed up we gotta start teaching children
That they can be all that they want to to be
Theres much more to life than just poverty
This is defiantly ah words of wisdom
America America America
I charge you with the crime of rape murder and assault
For suppressing and punishing my people
I charge you with robbery for robbing me of my history
I charge you with false imprisonment for keeping me
Trapped in the projects
And the jury finds you guilty on all accounts
And you are to serve the consequences of your evil schemes
Prosecutor do you have any more evidence
Words of Wisdom
They shine upon the strength of an nation
Conquer the enemy on with education
Protect thy self reach with what you want to do
Know thy self teach what we been through
On with the knowledge of the place then
No one will ever oppress this race again
No Malcolm X in my history text
Why is that
Cause he tried to educate and liberate all blacks
Why is Martin Luther King in my book each week
He told blacks if they get smacked turn the other cheek
I dont get it so many questions went through my mind
I get sweated They act as if asking questions is a crime
But forget it one day Im gonna prove them wrong
Now every brother had to smother on the welfare line
The American dream though it seems it attainable
Theyre pulling your slave dont believe
Cause it will strangle yeah
Pulling the life of your brain I cant explain
Beg as you can obtain from which you came
Swear that your mother is living in equality
Forgetting your brother thats living her apology
Thought they had us beat when they took our kids
But the battle aint over till the black man sings
Words of Wisdom
But the battle aint over till the black man sings
Words of Wisdom
Nightmare thats what I am
Americas nightmare
I am what you made me
The hate and evil that you gave me
I shine of a reminder of what you have done to my people
For Four hundred plus years
You should be scared
You should be running
You should be trying to silence me
Ha ha
But you can not escape fate
Well it is my turn to come
Just as you rose you shall fall
By my hands
Amerika you reap what you sow

Come hell or high water down to slaughter opposers
Just another lost soul stuck callin Jehovah
Outlaw til its over brand as my strap
Back like a cobra I stay drunk cause Im a mad man
Whenever sober on a one man mission
My ambition to hold up the rap game
While I pluck holes in niggaz like donuts
And still down to die for all my souljas
Like hillbillies they dont fear me
So refuse bringin war to the city
With each breath death before dishonor
Never let you swallow me no apologies your honor
A general in war Im the first to bomb
With a squad of trusted killers quick to move shit heavily armed
Im similar to Saddam sometimes I question Hussein
Like fiends frantic for that last vein stuck in the game
I hit the scene like sandstorms then transform watch me
I take the figure of dirty niggaz who all got me
While bitches wonderin who shot me
No love keep a grudge shootin sluggs like Muammar Quadaffi
Murder my friends build a new posse
We takin shots at paparazzi go and fly now nigga like Rocky
You got a lot of nerve to play me
Another gay rapper bustin caps to Jay-Z
buck buck buck buck buck buck
And still avoid capture while yall caught up in the rapture
Still after me Im in Jamacia sippin daquiris no doubt
We used to havin nothin then grabbin somethin and bustin
Wanted to be the thug-nigga that my old man wasnt
I came to a field catchin cases litigation
Niggaz playa-hatin got me crooked in all fifty states

Claimin that they ride rough but they soft as they cushion
They softer than bitches in the worst way drownin in blood
Outlawz my blood brothers Id die for these thuggs
Say hi to this slug its a shame how some niggaz on the west coast
Was ridin with Pac but when he died they went pop
Im on the Jers to the fullest like some west coast love
But after Pac stopped rappin it aint no west coast thug
Just westcoast what To my real niggaz stuck in the street game
Cause rappers like Jay-Z be pumpin cool-Aid through they veins
Is it true what Im sayin Slap your soft ass to the floor
And watch my fo-fo put peek holes through your door

Chorus
Time goes by puffin on lye
Hopin that it gets me high
Got a nigga goin cra-zy
Oh yeah I feel cra-zy
Tell em bout it
Last year was a hard one but life goes on
Hold my head against the wall learnin right from wrong
They say my ghetto instrumental detrimental to kids
As if they cant see the misery in which they live
Blame me for the outcome ban my records - check it
Dont have to bump this but please respect it
I took a minus and now the hard times are behind us
Turned into a plus now they stuck livin blinded
Hennesey got me feelin bad time to stop drinkin
Rollin in my drop-top Jag whats that cops thinkin
Sittin in my car watch the stars and smoke
I came a long way but still I got so far to go
Dear mama dont worry Ima watch for snakes
Tell Setchu that I love her but its hard to take
I got the letter that she sent me and I cried for weeks
This what came out when I tried to speak - all I heard was
One two three four
I see bloods and crips runnin up the hill
lookin for a better way
My brothers and sisters its time to build
cause even thug niggas pray
Hopin God hear me
I entered the game
look how much I changed
Im no longer innocent - casualties of fame
Made a lot of money seen a lot of places
And I swear I seen a peaceful smile on my mamas face
when I gave her the keys to her own house this your land
Your only son done became a man
watchin time fly I love my people do or die
But I wonder why we scared to let each other fly
June one-six seven-one the day
mama pushed me out her womb told me Nigga get paid
No one can understand me - the black sheep
Outcasted from my family now packin heat
I run the streets a young runaway live for today
When he died I could hear him say cmon
God help me out here cause Im possessed
I need the root of all evil for my stress
Cause moneys like a strong prescription drug its got me addicted
to the pleasure and the pain it inflicted
somethin bout the paper wit the pictures of the presidents head
Damn its like a motherfuckin plague that spread
Its epidemic forgotten forgotten it got worse
I keep my head on straight makin money cause its cursed
makin money makes a difference day by day so I gotta stay
paid no doubt day in and day out
This life is like a vicious cycle called fightin to live
No matter how hard you try to see death you gotta die
A lot of my peers didnt make it to the years to come
Did life do em right or did life leave em dumb
Who has the answers I wonder I turn to my elders
They aged and experienced but they cant even tell them
or tell me that therell be light at the end of the road
Why Cause they dont even know
A million thangs run through my mind
You aint gotta be in jail to be doin time
Im feelin fucked up in this bitch
I smoked half a ounce to the head
Chocolate tye indo Hawaiian lambs bread Buddha all that shit
Im fucked up in this motherfucker and Hennesey dont help
and Hennesey dont help Thug Passion in this muhfucker

Crack done took a part of my family tree

Is it my fault just cause Im a young black male
Cops sweat me as if my destiny is makin crack sales
Only fifteen and got problems
Cops on my tail so I bail til I dodge em
They finally pull me over and I laugh
Remember Rodney King and I blast on his punk ass
Now I got a murder case
you speak of heaven punk I never heard of the place
Wanted to come up fast got a Uz and a black mask
Duckin fuckin Task now whos the jack-ass
Keep my shit cocked cause the cops got a glock too
What the fuck would you do - drop them or let em drop you
I chose droppin the cop
I got me a glock and a glock for the niggaz on my block
Momma tried to stab me I moved out
Sold a pound a weed made Gs bought a new house
Im only seventeen Im the new kid
Got me a crew bought em jewels and a Uz-thick
But all good things dont last
Task came fast and busted my black ass
Coolin in the pen where the goods kept
Now my little brother wants to follow in my footsteps

All you wanted to be a soulja like me
All you wanted to be a soulja a soulja

Heres the anorexic Im makin it to an exit
Walkin through the streets on the black tip
Packed with several gats cause Im on some pay em back shit
Niggaz dont wanna try me brother youll get shot down
Now Im king of the block since my bigger brothers locked down
Im hot now so many punk police have got shot down
Other coppers see me on the block and they jock now
Thats what I call a kingpin
Send my brother what he needs and some weed up to Sing-Sing
Tellin him just be ready set
Pack ya shit up quick and when I hit be prepared to jet
Niggaz from the block on the boat now
Every single one got a gun thatll smoke pow
These punks about to get hit by the best
Im wearin double vest so aim at my fuckin chest
Ill be makin straight dome calls
Touch the button on the wall youll be pickin up your own balls
I can still hear my mother shout
Hit the pig nigga break your bigger brother out
I got a message for the warden
Im comin for ya ass as fast as Flash Gorden
We get surrounded in the mess hall yes yall
A crazy motherfucker makin death calls
Just bring me my brother and we leavin
For every minute you stall one of yall bleedin
They brought my brother in a jiffy
I took a cop just in case things got tricky
And just as we was walkin out Bang
I caught a bullet in the head the screams never left my mouth
My brother caught a bullet too
I think he gon pull through he deserve to
The fast life aint everything they told ya

You see you wouldnt ask why the rose that grew from the concrete

Niggas are quick to scream how they die for me now
Only got one click we Outlawz on the Row
Fair exchange when we fuck them hoes
Repetitive blows are thrown to my foes
No love shown get disposed of blasted full blown
My unknown tendencies to mash my car
Getting wicked with my ski-mask find the stash and dump
Why niggas run Im the last one standin the rest die
Victims of my lethal chrome cannon Westside
Though its worldwide no one can deny my views
Tracked it to my very fabric once the plastic blew
Five shots changed my whole life throats were slit
Niggas die by my orders when I wrote this shit
Though we go back like wild knights at Latin Quarters
Niggas tried to kill me and I fed they wife and they daughters
Blazed the weed draped they seeds gave em cash
Pass the fame and let the game go rollin past
Why you change its a cold world taught me life
Retaliation proves niggas never caught me right
Say they shot me in my nuts out of luck quick
Bullshit nigga cause Im still fuckin yo bitch
Niggas got me twisted in a bad way why you change
Fuck with me all this shit pay nigga fuck the fame
Dont remember Hit Em Up dont make us do it once more

Scared to come up out that cell nigga stay in it

Fuck a glock nine that shit is weak on the streets
And if you cant strategize then you just cant eat

If I sleep I wont eat who gonna feed my baby
And I think Im goin crazy cause my hair is gettin thiner

With guns under my mattress and guns under the pillow
And thats the way its gonna be til they bury me
But dont twist it cause none of yall niggas worry me

Laughing you motherfuckers cant stop me
Even if I die Im gon be a fuckin problem
Do you believe in ghosts motherfucker
Real live black ghosts
Feel me
Some say Im crazy these punk-ass cops cant fade me
Mama tried to raise me but had too many babies
Papa was a motherfuckin joke
Used to find dope in his coat
And nearly choked when hed tell me not to smoke
Daaamn dont get me started
My mama smoked so god damn much
When she was pregnant Im surprised I aint retarded
At night I cant sleep cant peep
As they pass through the glass of my neighbors five deep
Starin at the wall heard a scream
Wake up in the mornin
See the blood in the hall from the murder scene
Dont cry just ask why and try not to die
As I take you through a ghetto niggas lullabye
On the corner where the niggaz slang they crack
And the undercovers jack those that dont watch they back
five-oh I daydream about the dope world
Take a puff from the blunt and watch the smoke swirl
My mausberg goes boom whats another plug
Snatchin drugs pumpin slugs in these other thugs
give it up nigga dont run out of breath
Every step could be death til you blast
And be the last nigga left then Ill be ghost
Dont cry just ask why and try not to die
As I take you through a ghetto niggas lullabye
Dont cry just ask why and try not to die
As I take you through a ghetto niggas lullabye
A seven-deuce full of niggaz goes by
Thought I was trippin the second time they rolled by
Recognized the plates the faces looked familiar
Everybody swear they know the nigga thats gonna kill ya
Dont murder me murder me killa a nigga in his sleep
Let me die as I rest in peace deep
Back to these niggaz in the seven-deuce
A mac-ten out the window bout to let it loose what could I do
Run for cover and return fire
Die motherfuckin die hope yo ass fry dont ask why
But I let off everything I have
An empty clip hit the ground as a nigga dash
On my ass was the motherfuckin cops now
Barely breathin tryin to keep from gettin shot down
Boo-yaow is the sound bullet whizzed by
Still runnin like a nigga got nine lives
Dont know why but Im runnin to my fuckin block
Took a shot tired of runnin from the niggaz and the cops
Time to be a ghost
hey man come the fuck on
And then well be ghost
Dont cry just ask why and try not to die
As I take you through a ghetto niggas lullabye
Dont cry just ask why and try not to die
As I take you through a ghetto niggas lullabye
Fuck the police niggalaughingAhh Suge what I tell you nigga

You infiltrated my team and sold a niggas dreams
How could you do me like that
I took your family in
I put some cash in your pocket
Made you a man again
And now you let the fear put your ass in a place
Complicated to escape its a fools fate
Without your word youre a shell of a man

What could you do if it was up to you

Curious spittin lyrics on the verge of furious
Im addicted to currency nigga thats why were doin this I got set up
I surprised the niggas the way I got up and then
I hit the studio its time to blow the block up
No hesitation this information got you contemplatin
Heartbreakin and eliminatin with this conversation
Break him and let him see the face of a mental patient its a celebration
Of my criminal elevation more participation
I want members across the fifty states
We keep the nation anticipatin until we break
Will I be great is it my fate
To live the life of luxury some niggas bought my tapes

Guess she made a bad decision that got me livin
Just like an animal Im caged up in state prison

A cemetery full of motherfuckers got not knowin
Picture my prophecy the cops are attacking me on top of me
Im runnin from the coppers but never letem stop me cause Im a soldier

Taken risks while keepin cheap tricks from gettin on her
Life in tha hood

Me and you
No true a two
While scheming on hits
And gettin tricks
That maybe we can slide into
But now you buried
Rest nigga
Cause I aint worried
Eyes blurry
Sayin goodbye at the cemetary
Tho memories fade

So we both ball till my dying days
Before I say goodbye

Bury me smilin

Have a party at my funeral
Let every rapper rock it
Let tha hoes that I usta know
From way before
Kiss me from my head to my toe
Give me a paper and a pen
So I can write about my life of sin
A couple bottles of Gin
In case I dont get in
Tell all my people Im a Ridah
Nobody cries when we die
We outlaws
Let me ride
Until I get free
I live my life in tha fast lane
Got police chasen me
To my niggas from old blocks
From old crews
Niggas that guided me through
Back in tha old school
Pour out some liquor
Have a toast for tha homies
See we both gotta die
But ya chose to go before me
And brothas miss ya while your gone
You left your nigga on his own
How long we mourn
Life goes on
How many brothers fell victim to the streets

Bitches and niggas in penitentary suits
I send em letters and money orders and make em my troops
As for you females I got no time I gotta get mine
You cannot blind me addicted to a life of crime
My time as shorty was full of car chases

From here to East Greenwich through every state with a sentence
Frozen weight in the cooter ten plates to soup ya

Disappear in the night with my sixty-four dragon rag flaggin
As I get em up and leave em stuck
Pager blowin up but I dont give a fuck

Locers and smokers engaged twenty-foseven
So what can you do for me and what can I do for you
But stay true and do the things that we do
Blinded evil-minded no option for my offspring
Reminded cant find it complications what the future brings

Surrounded by niggaz but nary a motherfucker down to watch my back

Catch me slippin empty the clip and bury me
Hell nah nigga have to plug me twice
Aint no slippin when you thug for life motherfucker can you see
Never bow down let these other bitches crawl
Im a Thug motherfucker and these Thugs only ball
Aint no half steppin here from the cradle to the grave
Im a muhfuckin fool but I choose to get paid
Now my pockets gettin empty and Im panicked in a fright
Me and my bitch named Nina are fiendin tonight
Aint nobody livin safe got a plot and Im stressin
All I want is my muhfuckin money aint no question
Dont try to stall little trick cause we hit
So bring in the scissors and get to clippin at his dick
Id rather die young than die old and broke
Thats why I stay drunk and I constantly smoke
My memories as a youngsta hangin with the homies
But now Im doin bad and them bitches dont know me Who Who
But playa haters cant fade me Why
Cause this is thug life nigga and were crazy tell me do you see
Yeah constantly runnin from danger
Aint no stranger to cop cars
Gettin arrested and tested wearin a vest and dont drop my guards
My life is hectic my homies send mail from jail
Niggaz in Hell got some horrible stories to tell
Im catchin cases and still tryin to stack a grip
The IRS is tryin to stress off a niggaz shit
A young nigga never had a prayer to prevail
And all my peers doin years locked up in jail
What can I do stay strapped get a bigger crew
And creep around with them Dogg Pound niggaz too
And now we rich aint no bitch than can touch us
And its a trip how we clown when we fuck sluts
Bust nuts then I cut thats my new thang
And motherfuckers got on do-rags
Can I get paid can I get paid can I motherfuckin get paid
Nigga can work for his money all motherfuckin day and
Still never see a piece of it you understand me
Its not about the nice guy
Its bout the hardworkin motherfuckin Thug nigga
If you aint a thug nigga you aint really doin nothin
You aint really makin nothin
These motherfuckin po-pos and these pink folks
Got it all locked up for us to fail
See how they did OJ and they doin niggaz like that all day
So if you dont watch your motherfuckin stack
Believe me this could be your last breath
Chorus Repeat twoXJust cause a nigga come in he got style
Dont think I wont flip it
Dont pull your file
But I got enough bullshit to deal with
Im rollin with the thugs so
You must be on drugs to the head
Get your ass break down
Broken half baby
Im a feelin like a motherfuckin psychopathic
And if you got beef best leave it in the freezer
Im no joke
Mopreme straight lo
And you could get smoked
You hook the shit you get stroked
And all of that
And later be back for your motherfuckin dope sack
Kid it aint the type of day to play doughnut
Dont get your ass sewn up
Why you leakin on my blown out
Hey youre mixed up like a bowl of nuts
You fuck around and got it twisted up
Boy dont get it twisted
Dont get it twisted
Its the Macadoshis coming from the dark side
The park side where the OGs do ride
Aint nothing but killers in the park
As many niggas lost theys heart
When my gat sparks
Ill bust a cap in that ass
Dont get it twisted
When Im on a mission niggas come with Mishy
You busters gettin disciplined
And youre comin up short on your life
When I smoke you with this mac-ten
When its on its on
Fuck it
Im makin niggas kick the bucket when I check em by inducis
Aint no think to let my shit spin
You on my shit list hope you got a death wish
I tried to warn you but you missed me
You should have listened motherfucker when I said
Dont get it twisted
Dont get it twisted
Niggas got problems about gettin shit twisted
They need to stay the fuck out of grown folks business
Kids get a kick out of bumpin their big clips
But dont front no shit that brought no shit that peace started
Cause Im a cold hearted rider straight dunkin
Never through with my streets
Never hurt nobody but my heat
East side brothers dont hear me though
Theyd rather get shit twisted and gather like hoes
Bitch make ass niggas when I caught em
Couldnt bust a drape if they wanted
Theyre soft like Charmin
But I dont sweat varmits
I suffer with my black group
Just a one-day murderer
On the motherfuckin Rudy Poop
I snapped his soul son
Aint no damn thing funny when I spray your ass with my tongue
And your mommy cant save you now
Cause you got the job twisted up
For fuckin with a killer
Dont get it twistedHeaven aint hard to find
All you gotta do is look
Simply because you nervous let me start off with my conversation
Hoping my information elevates the hesitation
I can see it clearly now
Catch you smiling through your frown
Im askin Baby Boo are you down
Although I know youve heard about my reputation
Across the nation Mr I get around
My temptation got me dripping wet perspiration
Im activated by the moves your making
Baby why you faking strip naked get the love making
See its all in your mind so every time I sip a glass of wine
I fantasize till that ass is mine
Never gettin but wanting never touching but wishing
A straight thug on a mission until I get what Im missing
Stop with the beeper baby listen
I know youre grown but pay attention
Let me hypnotize with my tounge kissen
This is a message to bomb bodies and all dimes
Turn around one more time
Heaven aint hard to find
Heaven
Heaven aint hard to find
Heaven aint hard to find
Heaven aint hard to find
In fact you can have it just have faith
Just like a little kid still believing in magic
It takes a lot of sacrifice
With all the lonely nights on tour
I need somebody I can trust in my life
Let me apply the brakes
Baby youre moving to fast
My conversations are getting deeper but first let me ask
Are you afraid of a thug
And have you ever made love
With candles and bubbles sipping in your tub
Touch me and let me activate your blood pressure
This thug passion
Help the average man love better
Picture me naked and glistening beneath the moonlight mist
Take a shot of that Alize
Come give me a kiss
And maybe we can be better friends
Perhaps well be closer
Ill be the thug in your life
Baby and youll be my soulja
And I know it takes some time
And you got a lot of questions on your mind
But relax in due time
Heaven aint hard to find
Heaven
Heaven aint hard to find
Heaven aint hard to find
You think we all dogs thats why you cautious when I approached you
Been talking since you arrived but not a word is spoken
Through my eye contact I wink and you respond back
Look at me

Im sipping Hennessy and coke
Tho addicted to weed smoke

Come hollar at me baby love me for my thug nature
Far from a player hater label me a money maker
Straight heart breaker

Jealous niggas I despise look in my eyes
We tradin war stories we Outlawz on the rise
Jealous niggas I despise look in my eyes
Now can your mind picture a thug nigga drinkin hard liquor
This ghetto life has got me catchin up to God quicker
Who would figure that all I need was a hair trigger
Semi-automatic MAC-eleven just to scare niggas
Pardon my thug poetry but suckers is born everyday
And fear of man grow on trees
Criminal ties for centuries a legend in my own rhymes
So niggas whisper when they mention
Machiavelli was my tutor Donald Goines my father figure
Moms sent me to go play with the drug dealers
Hits fall we thug niggas and we came in packs
Every one of niggas strapped sippin on nac
In the back my AR-fifteen
Thuggin till I die these streets got me cravin thorazine
My lyrics are blueprints to money makin
Fat as that ass that honey shakin
My niggas tradin war stories we Outlawz on the rise
Jealous niggas I despise look in my eyes
We tradin war stories we Outlawz on the rise
Jealous niggas I despise look in my eyes
I bust a trey-trey buggin an shit
They call it overthuggin and shit
But I was just a younger nigga
Gettin older and lovin this shit
But what was I doin in this place
To the fakes without a pistol in the first
Facin termination in the worst
But I figured to play the wall to watch all these
Playa hatin niggas position for I could see em all
Made it up out of there lucky to be here to tell you
But itll never be a repeat people Im tryin to tell you
Now picture the scenery Im thugged out smokin greenery
Considered a BG but Im off in this game somethin D-P
My eyes only see deez thats why Im young and burnt out

When niggas ran up in my house
And I was too young to try to blast back
What happend then No one would tell me since I was three
Heard that God took my peoples now they living somewhere free
But fuck that you got whats mines and I want that
Never drop my guard been on the squad since ways back
And now Im sitting holding in anger because my parents missing

Outlawing from my tits to my clits dont try to figure
Cause the murderous tendencies of my mind cant be controlled nigga

Pull the fuckin fire when I leave em you shoulda seen em
Hostile hoes catch elbows beotch negroes disposed of
And snitches get dealt with with no love
Body bags of adversaries that I had to bury
I broke the law and they jaw all in the same flurry
But never worry theyll remember me through history
Causin motherfuckers to bleed theyll label me a
Outlaw outlaw outlaw they came in to sin
Outlaw outlaw outlaw dear God I wonder could you save me
Before I close my eyes I fantasize Im livin well
When I awake and realize Im just a prisoner in hell
Just as well cause in my cell Im keepin pictures of these bastards
Excercisin visualizin everyone inside a casket
Picture me blasted surrounded by niggas in masks
Sent with the task to harass and murder my ass
Will I last heaven or hell freedom or jail
Shits hard who can you tell and if we fail
High speeds and thai weed on the freeway
When will they learn to take it easy uh
Drive-bys and niggas die murder without a motive
By making motherfuckers fry
Got me runnin from these coward-ass crooked-ass cops
Helicopters tryin to hover over niggas til we drop
Got no time for the courts my only thought is open fire
Hit the district attorney but fuck that bitch cause shes a lie
Now its time to expire I see the judge spray the bitch
Motherfuckers is crooked is what I scream and hit the fence
I commence to get wicked spittin rounds as the plot thickens
Never missin an early grave is my only mission
If I die never worry bury me beside my four-five
May god forgive me I was high label me a
Outlaw outlaw outlaw they came in to sin
Outlaw outlaw outlaw dear god I wonder could you save me
Society lied to me I aint never gonna try to be

For ordinary reasons niggas bodies put to rest
So I just swallow my becks and holla fuck em
And if Im next just let a nigga step with somethin

Young and thuggin prepared for bustin if thats my destiny
Ready for whatever see you niggas cant get the best of me

Look in my eyes are you surprised that its me

Come take a walk on the wild side enjoy the view
Whenever we collide its bound to be a pleasurable time
Makin love til the early light
Sweetheart dont fight the feelin

Just looking back at the world from another level yaknowhatImean

Multiple gunshots fill the block the fun stops
Niggaz is callin cops people shot nobody stop
I wonder when the world stopped caring last night
Two kids shot while the whole block staring
I will never understand this society first they try
To murder me then they lie to me product of a dying breed
All my homies trying weed now the little babys
Crazed raised off Hennesey tell me will my enemies
Flee when they see me believe me
Even Thugs gotta learn to take it easy listen
Through the intermissions search your heart for a plan
And we turnin Bad Boys to grown men its on again
I give a holla to my niggaz in the darkest corners
Roll a perfect blunt and let me spark it for ya
One love from a thug nigga rollin with a posse
Full of paranoid drug dealers to the end my friend

Thug Life until I check out this bitch I thought you knew this
Who is gonna catch me when I fall or even care to
While you thinkin I see you lost up in my rearview
Half you is down with them Outlawz
Outcast left far Im through like southpaws
But still we keep mashin til our dreams come through
Starin at the world through my rearview
Now I was raised as a young black male
In order to get paid forced to make crack sales
Caught a nigga so they send me to these overpacked jails
In the cell countin days in this livin black Hell do you feel me
Keys to ignition use at your discretion
Roll with a twelve gauge pump for protection
Niggaz hate me in the section from years of chin checkin
Turn to Smith and Wesson war weapons
Heavenly Father Im a soldier Im gettin hotter
Cause the worlds gettin colder baby let me hold ya
Talk to my guns like they fly bitches
All you bustas best to run look at my bitches

Back in the days we hustled for sneakers and beepers
Nine-six for glocks cause fiends hittin up blocks with street sweepers
Bless myself when knowin rules to these streets somethin I learned
In school on some Million Man March shit for the piecepeace
True that only one life to lead a fast life of greed
Criminally addicted infested since a seed
We all die breed bleed like humans towns run
By young guns Outlawz and truants shits deep
Turn eighteen burn my will when I go
Burnt my body with my shotty or chosin my dough
So while you reminiscin all nights out with the crew
Smoke a blunt for me too Im starin through your rearview
Hahahaha you aint knowin what we mean by starin through the rearview
So since you aint knowin what we mean let me break down understandin
The world the world is behind us
Once a motherfucker get an understanding on the game
And what the levels and the rules of the game is
Then the world aint no trick no more
The world is a game to be played
So now we lookin at the world from like behind us
Niggaz know what we gotta do just gotta put our mind to it and do it

Lord knows

I smoke a blunt to take the pain out
And if I wasnt high Id probably try to blow my brains out
Im hopeless they shoulda killed me as a baby
And now they got me trapped in the storm Im goin crazy
Forgive me they wanna see me in my casket
And if I dont blast Ill be the victim of them bastards
Im loosin hope they got me stressin can the Lord forgive me
Got the spirit of a thug in me
Another sip of that drink this Hennessy got me queasy
Dont wanna earl young nigga take it easy
Picture your dreams on a triple beam and it seems
Dont underestimate the power of a fiend
To my homies on the block
Slangin rocks with your glocks put this tape in your box
When youre runnin from the cops and never look back
If they could be black then they would switch
Open fire on them busta-ass bitches and Lord knows
Lord knows Lord knows Lord knows
Lord knows
He knows Lord knows Lord knows Lord knows
The Lord knows
He knows Lord knows Lord knows Lord knows
The Lord knows
He knows Lord knows Lord knows Lord knows
I wonder if the Lord will forgive me or bury me a G
I couldnt let my adversaries worry me
And every single day its a test wear a bulletproof vest
And still a nigga stressin over death
If I could choose when a nigga die figure Id
Take a puff on the blunt and let my trigga fly
When everyday its another death with every breath
Its a constant threat so watch yo step
You could be next if you want to who do you run to
Murderin niggas look what its come to
My memories bring me misery and life is hard
In the ghetto its insanity I cant breath
Got me thinkin what do Hell got
Cause I done suffered so much Im feelin shell-shocked
And drivebys an everyday thang
I done lost too many homies to this motherfuckin game
And Lord knows
Lord knows Lord knows Lord knows
Lord knows
He knows Lord knows Lord knows Lord knows

Kill me if they could Ill never let em capture me
Done lost too many niggas to this gang-bangin
Homies died in my arms with his brains hangin fucked up
I had to tell him it was alright and thats a lie
And he knew it when he shook and died my God
Even though I know Im wrong man
Hennesey make a nigga think he strong man heh heh
I cant sleep so I stay up dont wanna fuck them bitches
Try to calm me down I aint givin up
Im gettin lost in the weed man gettin high
Livin everday like Im gon die gon die gon die
I smoke a blunt to take the pain out and if I wasnt high
Probably try to blow my brains out
Lord knows

Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord my guns to keep
If I die before I wake
I pray the Lord my soul to take
God as my witness when thugs cry too much is hard
Born thuggin and lovin the way I came up
Big money clutchin bustin while evadin cocaine busts
My pulse rushin send my pulse into insanity
Shout at my cousin now we bustin if they yo family
The coppers want to see me buried I aint worried
I got a line on the DA cause Im fuckin his secretary
I black out and start cussin bust em and touch em all
They panic and bitches duckin I rush em and fuck em all
Ill probably be an old man before I understand
Why I had to live my life with pistols close at hand
Kidnapped my homeys sister cut her face up bad
They even raped so we blazed they pad
Automatic shots rang out on every block
They puttin hits out on politicians even cops I aint lyin
They got me sleepin with my infrared beams
And in my dreams I hear motherfuckers screamin
What is the meaning when thugs cry
Oh why children send your child off to die
In the streets of chalk where they lie
Let no wrongs cry out when thugs cry
Dear God When thugs cry
Oh why does it have to be this way our
Children of today wont stay wise thugs cry
Let the children hear when thugs cry
Dear God oh why
Heh maybe my addiction to friction got me buggin
Where is the love Never quit my ambition to thug
Aint shed a tear since the old school years of elementary
Niggas I used to love enclosed in penitentiaries
But still homey keep it real how does it feel
To lose your life over somethin that you did as a kid
You all alone no communication block on the phone
Dont get along with yo pop and plus your moms is gone
Where did we go wrong I put my soul in the song
To help us grow at times but now our minds are gone
We went from brothers and sisters to niggas and bitches
We went from welfare livin to worldwide riches
But somethin changed in this dirty game everythings strange
Lost all my homies over cocaine mayne
See they ask me if I shed a tear I aint lie
See you gotta get high or die cause even thugs cry
Oh why children send your child off to die
In the streets of chalk where they lie
Let no wrongs cry out when thugs cry
Dear God When thugs cry
Oh why does it have to be this way our
Children of today wont stay wise thugs cry
Let the children hear when thugs cry
Dear God oh why
And all I see is these paranoid bitches illegal adventures
Bustin motherfuckers with uppercuts I leave em with dentures
Cause in my criminal mind nobody violates the Don
I write your name on a piece of paper now your familys gone
Why perpetrate like you can handle my team
So merciless that my attackll take command of your dreams
Leavin motherfuckers drownin in they own blood
Clownin takin pictures later
Laugh bout the punk bitches that turned snitches
Regulate my area the terror I represent
Makin yo people disappear you wonderin where they went
Am I cold or is it just I sold my soul
Addicted to these streets never find true peace Im told
Come take my body God dont let me suffer any longer
Smoke a pound of marijuana so I know it aint long
Where is the end to all my misery is there a close
I suppose thats why I murder my foes when thugs cry
Oh why children send your child off to die
In the streets of chalk where they lie
Let no wrongs cry out when thugs cry
Dear God When thugs cry
Oh why does it have to be this way our
Children of today wont stay wise thugs cry
Let the children hear when thugs cry
Dear God oh why
I shed tattooed tears for years
For my dead homeboys and my prison peers
Yall aint never heard my cries
Now you wonder why would you die
Oh why children send your child off to die
In the streets of chalk where they lie
Let no wrongs cry out when thugs cry
Dear God When thugs cry

You gotta keep a sense of humor
Gotta be able to smile through all this bullshit
Remember that
Just keep ya head up
Our lifesytles be close caption
Addicted to fatal attraction
Pictures and actions be played back
In the mist of mashin
No fairytales for this young black male
Some see me stranded in this land of Hell
Jail and crack cells
culture
Or the repercussion
While bustin on back-stabbing vultures
Sellin my soul
For material wishes
Fast cars and bitches
Wishin I live my life a legend
Immortalized in pictures
Why shed tears save your sympathy
My childhood years
Was spend burying my peers in the cemetery
Heres a message to the newborns
Waiting to breath
If you believe
you can achieve just look at me
Against all odds
Though life is hard we carry on
Living in the projects
Broke with no lights on
To all the Gs that follow me
Protect your essence
Born with less but your still precious
Just smile for me now
Oh Wont you smile for me
Just smile for me now
Oh Wont you smile for me
Nigga you black smile for me now
Oh Wont you smile for me
You aint got nothin to worry about
Smile for me now
Oh Wont you smile for me
And the next generation
Now as I open up my story
With the blaze of your blunt
So you can picture thoughts slowly
Upon phrases I run
And I can walk you through the dayz that it done
I often wish that I can save everyone
But Im a dreamer
Have you ever seen a nigga
Who was strong in the game
Over-looking his tomorrows
and they finally came
Look back on childhood memories
And Im still feelin the pain
Turnin circles in my nineth grade
Dealin Cocaine
To many hassels in my local lights
Survivin the strain
And a man without a focused life
could drive him insane
Stuck inside a getto fantasy
Hopin itd change
But were not focused on reality
We broken in Jane
Had a dream of livin wealthy
Makin it big
Over football

What take it
He did
And after all my mamas thankin god
For blessing her child
All my mama gotz to do now is collect
And then smile
twoPac Smile
Oh Wont you smile for me
Just smile for me now
Oh Wont you smile for me
Nigga you black smile for me now
Oh Wont you smile for me
You aint got nothin to worry about
Smile for me now
Oh Wont you smile for me
And the next generation
Oh Wont you smile for me
Smile for me now
Fuck tha world
As we unload we witness furious speeds
Un-answered questions keep us all stressin
Curious Gs
Back stabed and bleeding
Crooked thoughs
Laced with weed
Learnin duckin stray shots
Bullets be hot
They burnin
Inhale the shurm smoke
Visualize the flames
Will I be smothered by my own pain
Strange wisdoms
Cowards conversate
So quick to dis us
Takin pictures for the Feds
In desperate hopes they get us
Hit us all give us plenty centuries
Forgive my stance
Sense I entered many penitentiaries
The best revenge
Is fuck friends
We milatary minded soljahs
Bustin shots blindly
Trying to find Jahova
To help me
Somebody save me
Lost and crazy
Scared to drop a seed
Hopin I aint cursed babies
Maybe now
Niggaz feel me now
Picture my pain
Embrace my words
Make the world change
And still I smile nigga
Oh Wont you smile for me
Just smile for me now
Oh Wont you smile for me
Nigga you black smile for me now
Oh Wont you smile for me
You aint got nothin to worry about
Smile for me now

Just released another album under the alias Makaveli
Music insiders are running wild trying to rearrange other artist
Street dates in fear of a wipeout in retail interchart movement
Although no one knows the exact cause of the new album
Resources tell me a number of less fortunate rappers
Have joined together in conspiracy to assassinate the character
Of not only Mr Shakur but of Death Row Records as well
Nas the alleged ring leader of it is furious at Tupac
Excuse me Makavelis verbal assault

Remember memories so vividly
Was once a little dust kicker now becomes a G

Collect calls to my Dogz from the County Jail
Sendin me mail

This lifestyle is forever

Nobody knows where well be
My Enemies your enemies
Cause you aint never had a friend like me
How can I be blamed
Forgive me Lord Im insane
In search of fame
Wont hurt to change
Follow in foot steps of past dealers
Equipped with ski masks
No witnesses as we blast fearless
Reckon now they feel us
In this act of war
more casualties
no survivors
Any man the defies us
Quickly dies
cause we Ridahs
In my quest for chips
We wear vest
Equipped with automatic fire
We reply when my enemies trip
Me and you against the nation
Whispering while we conversatin
cause niggaz died over information
How much more can we take
Expect us all to wait
The world aint ready for us yet
So lets make Clinton pay
haha
They never wanted us to make it
Everything that we posses
We had to fight and take it
I think the president is smoking weed
Bumpin his beat
Makin a livin out of my misery
Till he got a friend like me
Promise to visit
I know its rough in your cell
Receiving mail to the county jail
This is hell
When I was young
I could picture livin
In Luxury
So how the fuck did I end up in prison
Fuckin snitches
They got me crossed by my own side
I found him by his self
No drama he alone die
Nobody cry
Should have never testified
You got my nigga twenty-five
So now I sacrifice your life
Help to separate me and my dog
Broken ties
Why the fuck should I let you live
When Im dead inside
Rapid fire my delivery
Im bustin at their whole crew
Nigga remember me
Hit up my Outlaw set
Then throw my pistol in the ocean
Ditch my ski mask
And get to straight coastin
Its visitin day at San Quinton
Always there to see your closest row dog
cause You aint ever had a friend like me
Small Chorus Xtwo
Come after us best be complete
My enemies your enemies
Cause you aint ever had a friend like me
Nobody knows where well be
My Enemies your enemies
Cause you aint never had a friend like me
You aint ever had a friend like me
Till fadeHeaven aint hard to find
All you gotta do is look
Simply because you nervous let me start off with my conversation
Hoping my information elevates the hesitation
I can see it clearly now
Catch you smiling through your frown
Im askin Baby Boo are you down
Although I know youve heard about my reputation
Across the nation Mr I get around
My temptation got me dripping wet perspiration
Im activated by the moves your making
Baby why you faking strip naked get the love making
See its all in your mind so every time I sip a glass of wine
I fantasize till that ass is mine
Never gettin but wanting never touching but wishing
A straight thug on a mission until I get what Im missing
Stop with the beeper baby listen
I know youre grown but pay attention
Let me hypnotize with my tounge kissen
This is a message to bomb bodies and all dimes
Turn around one more time
Heaven aint hard to find
Heaven
Heaven aint hard to find
Heaven aint hard to find
Heaven aint hard to find
In fact you can have it just have faith
Just like a little kid still believing in magic
It takes a lot of sacrifice
With all the lonely nights on tour
I need somebody I can trust in my life
Let me apply the brakes
Baby youre moving to fast
My conversations are getting deeper but first let me ask
Are you afraid of a thug
And have you ever made love
With candles and bubbles sipping in your tub
Touch me and let me activate your blood pressure
This thug passion
Help the average man love better
Picture me naked and glistening beneath the moonlight mist
Take a shot of that Alize
Come give me a kiss
And maybe we can be better friends
Perhaps well be closer
Ill be the thug in your life
Baby and youll be my soulja
And I know it takes some time
And you got a lot of questions on your mind
But relax in due time
Heaven aint hard to find
Heaven
Heaven aint hard to find
Heaven aint hard to find
You think we all dogs thats why you cautious when I approached you
Been talking since you arrived but not a word is spoken
Through my eye contact I wink and you respond back
Look at me

I got a flight out Chicago lets kick it this weekend

Sometimes when Im alone
I cry because Im on my own
All the tears I cry are bitter and warm
They flow with life and take no form
Ah the world moves fast
and it would rather pass you on by
than to stop and see what makes you cry
Its painful so sad sometimes I cry
But no one really cares
to ask why why why
Well I cry because my heart is torn
I find it hard to carry on
And if I had an ear to confide in
I would cry amongst my treasured friends
A-but who do you know that stops that long
to help another carry on
Ah the world moves fast
and it would rather pass you on by
than to stop and see what makes you cry
Its painful so sad sometimes I cry
And no one really cares

Can you picture my prophecy
Stress in the city the cops is hot for me
The projects is full of bullets the bodies is droppin
There aint no stoppin me
Constantly movin while makin millions
Witnessin killings leavin dead bodies in abandoned buildings
Carries to children cause theyre illin
Addicted to killin and the appeal from the cap peelin
Without feelin but will they last or be blasted
Hard headed bastard
Maybe hell listen in his casket the aftermath
More bodies being buried Im losing my homies in a hurry
Theyre relocating to the cemetery
Got me worried stressin my visions blurried
The question is will I live No one in the world loves me
Im headed for danger dont trust strangers
Put one in the chamber whenever Im feelin this anger
Dont wanna make excuses cause this is how it is
Whats the use unless were shootin no one notices the youth
Its just me against the world baby
Me against the world
Its just me against the world
Ooh yeah ooh-hoo
Its just me against the world
Me against the world
Cause its just me against the world baby
Hey
Me against the world
Ooh yeah
I got nothin to lose
Its just me against the world baby
I got nothin to lose
Could somebody help me Im out here all by myself
See ladies in stores Baby Capones livin wealthy
Pictures of my birth on this Earth is what Im dreamin
Seein Daddys semen full of crooked demons already crazy
And screamin I guess them nightmares as a child
Had me scared but left me prepared for a while
Is there another route For a crooked Outlaw
Veteran a villian a young thug who one day shall fall
Everday theres mo death and plus Im dough-less
Im seein mo reasons for me to proceed with thievin
Scheme on the scheming and leave they peeps grieving
Cause aint no bucks to stack up my nuts is backed up
Im bout to act up go load the Mac up now watch me klacka
Tried makin fat cuts but yo it aint workin
And Evils lurking I can see him smirking
When I gets to pervin so what
Go put some work in and make my mail makin sales
Risking twenty-five with a L but oh well
Me against the world
With nothin to lose
Its just me against the world
Ooh yeah ooh-ooh
Its just me against the world baby
Me against the world
I got nuttin to lose
Its just me against the world
Oh oh
Ha ha

With nothin to lose
Its just me against the world baby
Me against the world ho ah
Me against the world
I got nothin to lose
Its just me against the world baby
Ha-hahh hehe heyy
With all this extra stressin
The question I wonder is after death after my last breath
When will I finally get to rest Through this suppression
They punish the people thats askin questions
And those that possess steal from the ones without possessions
The message I stress to make it stop study your lessons
Dont settle for less even the genius asks-es questions
Be grateful for blessings
Dont ever change keep your essence
The power is in the people and politics we address
Always do your best dont let the pressure make you panic
And when you get stranded
And things dont go the way you planned it
Dreamin of riches in a position of makin a difference
Politicians and hypocrites they dont wanna listen
If Im insane its the fame made a brother change
It wasnt nothin like the game
Its just me against the world
Me against the world
Nothin to lose
Its just me against the world baby
Me against the world
Got me stuck in the game
Its just me against the world
Oh ah
Id be ashamed to lose
Its just me against the world baby
Me against the world
Heh ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
Thats right
I know it seem hard sometimes but uh
Remember one thing
Through every dark night theres a bright day after that
So no matter how hard it get stick your chest out
Keep your head up and handle it
Me against the world
Me against the world
Me against the worldExpect me nigga like you expect Jesus to come back
Expect me nigga
Im coming
Expect me nigga like you expect Jesus to come back
Expect me nigga
Im coming Haha for all my niggas in the hood yeah
That live the life of a ghetto star
You know you know how we do it
Ha Makaveli
Just holla my name and witness game official
Niggas is so ashamed they stand stiff like scared bitches
While I remain inside a paradox called my block
Though gunshots is promised to me when will I stop
I hit the weed and hope to God I can fly high
Witness my enemies die when I ride by they shouldnt tried
I send they bodies to they parents up North
With they faces laid bris and they nuts cut off
Fuck em all what I scream as I dream in tongues
Fuck a trick get me rich and the bitches will come
Bust my gun make em all scatter
Bullets to my nuts only made my balls better eat a dick biatch
Mercy never that you say you comin back
Bring it on forever strapped
Introduce you to the pleasure and the pain you can go so far
Just sell me your soul and live the life of a ghetto star
I live the life of a thug nigga drug dealer livin game tight
Mug niggas slug niggas for the fame life
Laced with game practice on takin pain
Quick to slang and let it rain through yo brain
Street smart proficient intelligent
And keep suckers hittin til snitches start smellin it
Movin niggas with telekineses
Keepin Channel seven at work filmin different features
Leadin niggas to an early death with they head blown
And to those who didnt make it to the morgue was just dead and gone
And hope niggas got punished
Kidnapped jacked in the back with macs to they neck
Rappers waitin to get done in
We tossed his ass out
MOB related one mo nigga found shot up with his dick in his mouth
Printed my name in these streets as a motherfuckin G
Now the next generations looking up to me
Walkin through the cemetary
Talkin to my homies that was buried
See my enemies wanna see me dead I aint worried forgive me
Please give me shelter calm my fears
Lifted my head from my hands had a palm of tears
I see bodies gettin splashed with acid
Two shots rang from the plastic glock wrapped in plastic
Buried the bastard time to notify his family
Shit aint nuttin left to be identified
Evacuate the crime scene fast why
Why I heard the Feds had a warrant for my ass fly
I wont touch down til I see Tijuana
Set up shop sellin them crooked cops marijuana
Label me a success I made the switch
Retired from the life that never gave me shit
With cash that I couldnt spend countless cars
An addict for a wife my life as a ghetto star
Got the word that some nerds wanna plot on this
Hit the curve let it swerve had to stop they grip
No remorse no repentance as I buck one down
Straight to the morgue cause I plan on shuttin shit down
Born soldiers
Fucked him up with a Mac four
Torn ligaments all up in that nigga shoulder
And a vest couldnt protect that flesh
Cause I got slugs to knock the air out your chest
Death apparently they wasnt sucka free
Cause I had all them wannabe thug niggas in protective custody
I guess they heard that I got them birds
Thought I was a nerd til I bucked one of them to the curb
Luxury livin lavish with dreams of dyin rich
With a team and clientÃle on my motherfuckin dick
And gettin down on these snitch bitches protectin riches
By givin stitches the life as a ghetto star
When I grow up I wanna be like them and live my life as a ghetto star
When I grow up I wanna be like them and live my life as a ghetto star
When I grow up I wanna be like them and live my life as a ghetto star
When I grow up I wanna be like them and live my life as a ghetto star
When I grow up I wanna be like them and live my life as a ghetto star
When I grow up I wanna be like them and live my life as a ghetto star
This goes out to all you motherfuckers
That still have to kill to make that money
All you niggas on the block sellin rocks
Hand to hand runnin from the police smokin weed
I see you
Live your life as a ghetto star
Talking to thise hood rat bitches tramp ass hoes
Claiming you gettin riches living my life as a ghetto star
Mutherfuckin playas and these fake ass niggas
Living life as a ghetto star
Niggas with two strikes that dont wanna see the third
I feel ya
This is the Don Makaveli
Living my life as a ghetto star
Fuck themPlease wake me when I am free
I cannot bear activity
Where my couch I am told Hold no significance
I waited and died in ignorance
But my inner eye can see erase
Who reigned as king in another place
The green trees were reached from fall
And every man spoke of beautiful men and women together as people
War was gone because all was at peace
But now like a nightmare I woke to see
That I live like a prisoner of poverty
Please wake me when I am free
I cannot bear activity
Fall I will have a stricken blind
Than to live without expression of mindRest in peace to my motherfucker Biggy Smallz
Thats right bwoy
Its goin on right here
Thug Life
God bless the dead
God bless the dead and buried nigga
Dont worry if you see God first
Tell him shit got worse I aint mad
I know you representin the crew
And I can picture you in heaven with a blunt and a brew
Fuck the world pain was a part of the game
If you a baller money went as quick as it came
My role models gone or they locked in the pen
Straight hustlers caught up in the whirlwind
The other day I thought I seen my homeboy Biggy
Sayin shit dont stop nigga no pity
We all hoods and all we ever had was dreams
Money makin motherfuckers plot scandalous schemes
In the gutter you learn to have a criminal mind
I was addicted to tryin never meant to do time
My epitaph will read was the last of Gs
Kicked the shit to make the white man bleed
God bless the dead thats right thats right
God bless the dead yeah dont stop
God bless the dead
God bless the dead
Man aint nobody promised me a thang
I been caught up in this game
Ever since I was a little motherfucker wantin to hang
I can see em in my head pow
Memories of my nigga but he dead now
Lookin back in my yearbook all the years took
Half my peers theyre stretched for years
And if I die will they all shed tears
Two to the dome leave me alone let me get my head clear
Paranoid got me lookin in the mirror
Behind me life without my nine Id rather do the time
See Im old enough to know that aint no justice
And all the courts same way they fucked us
And why the hell am I locked in jail
They let them white boys free we be shocked as hell
In my mind I can see it comin
And all the time its a plot to keep a nigga runnin
I keep a gun and never run unless Im comin at ya
Cry later but for now lets enjoy the laughter
God bless the dead thats right thats right
God bless the dead
God bless the dead Yeah rest in peace to all the motherfuckers that passed too early
All the young motherfuckers that was took in they prime God bless the dead

Starry night an unknown creation
Written by and from the archives of Tupac Shakur
Dedicated to the memory of Vincent Van Gogh
A creative heart obsessed with satisfying
this dorment and uncaring society
You have given them the stars at night
and you have given them bountiful bouquets of sunflowers
but for you theres only contempt
Though you pour yourself into that frame and present it so proudly
this world could not accept your masterpieces from the heart
So on that starry night you gave to us and you took away from us
the one thing we never acknowledged your life
Mac Mall
Yeah game laid down by Q yknawmsayin
Vocals by Rasheeda fly beat by QDIII
And flows by the M-A-C yall Mr M-A-C Mall
CHORUS Rasheeda
Starry night your life
You gave to us and took away from us
Starry night your life
You gave to us and took away from us
Mac Mall
Uhh uhh watch me live my art writin words from my soul in blood
I speak the truth on every thang I love
Ill probably sacrifice my life to send my message through mics
Its like a war drum callin soldiers at night
Its bigger than music I spit it straight from the heart
So its cold n dark and deep like a universe but nah dont start
Its for ya entertainment but its my life yall
And I cant rewind fast forward or press pause
But when you give your all its like the fans demand more
And after the tour I sit alone like before
When ya name is hot its all love the world is yours
But when you fall off you get ignored
CHORUS
Mac Mall
You on the cover of da magazine flossin on the TV screen
Toastin wit yo champagne playin life like a game
Loaded in the limousine love to hear the fans scream
Swimmin wit the sharks now aint no love - money king
People got they hands out but aint nobody lendin hands
Can you really blame dem for tryin to get what they can
Late night bright lights lust n lies
And anythang goes under the Hollywood sign
Well you might lose ya soul and who knows what you find
But go ahead main we all wanna shine
But go ahead main we all wanna shine
CHORUS
Mac Mall
There you have it
Yknow when I was younger I prayed to get in this game
Yknow to hold dis microphone in my hand
I asked the man upstairs to let me rock a crowd one day
Yknow let people out there feel the way I feel through my music
Like my homeboy Tupac did fo sho
And he gave that to me
But he didnt he didnt he didnt let me know
about all the shady Shit thats in in between
you and yo dream yknow
See its more than the music I spit it from the heart
So sometime its cold n its dark but its raw
And thats how Ima bring it to you every time yknow
CHORUSAgainst an attacker I will boldly take my stand
Because my heart will show fear for no man
But for a broken heart I run with freight
Scared to be blind in a vulnerable night
I believe this fear is in every man
Some will acknowledge it others will fail to understand
There is no fear in a shallow heart
Because shallow hearts dont fall apart
But feeling hearts that truly care
Are fragile to the flow of air
And if I am to be true then I must give my fragile heart
I may receive great joy or you may return it ripped apartFeaturing Outlawz

Cause I hate to spend
My life my life my life my life
Duckin one-time Lost Soul
How it start how it start
Started off with runnin from copses duck and hide from helicopters
We open fire who can stop us
Livin the life of trife juveniles hopin for righteous
Gettin twenty-five to life if the judge dont like us
In my clearest pictures I see authorities itchin to get us
ATF state feds scandalous bitches
I wasnt promised to it wasnt bitter or sweet
See if a nigga dont hustle then the nigga dont eat
Only streets livin do or die circle complete
Repetitive motions and felons in the rush for cheese
Please understand my history a man of many acts
Livin Thug Life comin equipped with many gats
Maybe I was just a Lost Soul trapped in time
Livin in between life and the cracks were blind
Even though we had hope for dreams that never came
Yet and still we all feel pain
Just wait until rain turn to sunshine
Cause I hate to spend my life my life my life my life
Duckin one-time Stranded in the County in the worst way
Hell of a way to spend my twenty-first birthday
Born in the ghetto as a street thug
Its for the neighborhood and weed spots that we love
Lost Souls
Lost Souls nigga for my homeboys that passed on
Words from the mind of a Lost Soul
Just wait until rain turn to sunshine
Cause I hate to spend my life my life my life my life

Young Noble
My brother Sean first on my list he stuck with
a three-five when he get out would I be dead or alive
He taught me the rules so much but still In Thugs I Trust
When in danger never hesitate to keep my fuckin trap shut
My Mom Dukes got a little bit of Thug in her
The Devil loves sinners crackheads and drug dealer
Sometimes I feel like the streets are takin over
Never stayin sober the brain over and over backtrack
My stacks fat I used to take new
One love to my crew aiyyo this ones for you

But see I saw no reason for me to celebrate let me demonstrate
Entered the world from out a poisonous womb
Heroin bein consumed already predicitin my doom soon
to be one of the many misguided
Always the first one on the block to be done tried it and liked it
Lost before I had a chance to find my way
Now I travel through life not knowin the time of day

I swear to God its just a setup
And these are the words from the mind of a Lost Soul Ima Lost Soul

But they cant do nothing to a G
Lets get ready to rumble
Now you know how we do it like a G
What really go on in the mind of a nigga
That get down for theirs
Constantly money over bitches
Not bitches over money
Stay on your grind nigga
My ambitions as a ridah
My ambitions as a ridah
So many battlefield scars while driven in plush cars
This life as a rap star is nothing without heart
Was born rough and rugged addressing the mass public
My attitude was fuck it cause motherfuckers love it
To be a soldier must maintain composure at ease
Though life is complicated only what you make it to be
Uh and my ambitions as a ridah to catch her
While she hot and horny go up inside her
Then I spit some game in her ear go to the telly ho
Equipped with money in a Benz cause bitch Im barely broke
Im smoking bomb ass weed feeling crucial
From player to player the games tight the feelings mutual
From hustling and prayers to breaking motherfuckers to pay up
I got no time for these bitches cause these hoes try to play us
Im on a meal ticket mission want a mill so Im wishing
Competition got me ripped on that bullshit they stressing booyah
Imma rhyme though clown hoes like its mandatory
No guts no glory my nigga bitch got the game distorted
Now its on and its on because I said so
Cant trust a bitch in the business so I got with Death Row
Now these money hungry bitches getting suspicious
Started plotting and planning on schemes to come and trick us
But thug niggas be on point and game tight
Me Syke and Bogart strapped up the same night
Got problems then handle it motherfuckers see me
These niggas is jealous cause deep in they heart they wanna be me
Uh yeah and now ya got me right beside ya
Hoping you listen I catch you paying attention
To my ambitions as a ridah
I wont deny it Im a straight ridah
You dont wanna fuck with me
Got the police bustin at me
But they cant do nothing to a G
It was my only wish to rise
Above these jealous coward motherfuckers I despise
When its time to ride I was the first off this side give me the nine
Im ready to die right here tonight and motherfuck they life yeah nigga
Thats what they screaming as they drill me but Im hard to kill
So open fire I see you kill me witness my steel
Spitting at adversaries envious and after me
Id rather die before they capture me watch me bleed
Mama come rescue me Im suicidal thinking thoughts
Im innocent so therell be bullets flying when Im caught
Shoot Fuck doing jail time better day sacrificing
Wont get a chance to do me like they did my nigga Tyson
Thugging for life and if you right then nigga die for it
Let them other brothers try at least you tried for it
When its time to die to be a man you pick the way you leave
Fuck peace and the police my ambitions as a ridah
I wont deny it Im a straight ridah
You dont wanna fuck with me
Got the police bustin at me
But they cant do nothing to a G
My murderous lyrics equipped with spirits of the thugs before me
Pay off the block evade the cops cause I know they coming for me
I been hesitant to reappear been away for years
Now Im back my adversaries been reduced to tears
Question my methods to switch up speeds sure as some bitches bleed
Niggasll feel the fire of my mothers corrupted seed
Blast me but they didnt finish
Didnt diminish my powers
So now Im back to be a motherfucking menace they cowards
Thats why they tried to set me up
Had bitch ass niggas on my team so indeed they wet me up
But Im back reincarnated incarcerated
At the time I contemplate the way that God made it
Lace em with lyrics thats legendary musical mercenary
For money Ill have these motherfuckers buried I been
Getting much mail in jail niggas telling me to kill it
Knowing when I get out they gon feel it
Witness the realest a hoo-ridah when I put the shit inside
The cry from all your people when they find her
Just remind ya my historyll prove authentic
Revenge on them niggas that played me
And all the cowards that was down with it
Now its yo nigga right beside ya
Hoping you listening catch you paying attention
To my ambitions as a ridahYeah ballad of a dead soldier
This is the ballad of a dead soldier
This is the ballad of a dead soldier
Come play the ballad of a dead soldier
The plan to take command of the whole family
Though underhanded to be the man it was planned
All my road dawgs official mob niggaz love to act up
The first to bomb we rob niggaz
I can be lost in my own mind
To be the boss only thoughts grip on chrome nines
Niggaz get tossed up war scars battlefield memories
Swore I saw the devil in my empty glass of Hennesey
Talkin to a nigga on a tight leash
Screamin Fuck the police as I ride through the night streets
Lil child runnin wild toward his danger
Whats the cause dont be alarmed death to all strangers
Maybe Im a madman
A pistol grabbin nigga unleash the Sandman
Promisin merciless retaliation nothin is colder
Close your eyes hear the ballad of a dead soldier
Thug for Life I will be this is the ballad of a dead soldier
A life of crime I will lead close your eyes hear the ballad of a dead soldier
If you play the game you play to win this is the ballad of a dead soldier
Its a crazy world full of sin close your eyes
Completely lost revenge at all costs
Paybacks a bitch switch now the tricks crossed
Tossed up and never to be heard of
A single witness screamin bloody murder murder
Blast tell me homey what you see now
A blind man and a dead body Im read to leave town
And get my cash though hook up with Kastro
Homey had to blast on the task force
Stupid coppers tried to play us out never that
They took my money and my stash time to get em back heh heh
Upon my secret arrival
Two glock four-fives time for survival
Death to my rivals tell me what you want lord
Nobody left after the death of a drug lord eh eh
The situations critical
Nothin is colder than hear the ballad of a dead soldier
Thug for Life I will be this is the ballad of a dead soldier
A life of crime I will lead close your eyes hear the ballad of a dead soldier
If you play the game you play to win this is the ballad of a dead soldier
Close your eyes and hear the ballad of a dead soldier
Be a coward put yo hands to the moon
When my glocks rang out the niggaz came out boom
Who want to see me in the challenge
So merciless Im terrifyin niggaz in my ballads do you feel me
Capo or Capi-tan one day Ill be the Don
Until then remain strong
My only fear of death is reincarnation
Bustin at my adversaries like a mental patient
To all my niggaz facin sixty years sheddin tattooed tears
Another suicidal on the peer
Takin private planes tryin to survive the game
For all my homies thatll never be alive again
All he promised us is death nigga
Take a breath come be the last one left nigga its real now
Villain to fantasize aint nothin colder
Listen you can hear it - the ballad of a dead soldier
Thug for Life I will be this is the ballad of a dead soldier
A life of crime I will lead close your eyes hear the ballad of a dead soldier
If you play the game you play to win this is the ballad of a dead soldier
Close your eyes and hear the ballad of a dead soldier

When your heart turns cold
I say when your heart turns cold
it causes your soul to freeze
It spreads throughout yo spirit
like a ruthless feeling disease
The walls the walls that once were down
now stand firm and tall safe from hate love pain joy
until you feel nothing at all
When your heart turns cold
I say when your heart turns cold
A babys cry means nothing
A dead corpose is tri-vial
Mothers neglecting children is daily
Loneliness becomes your routine friend
Death death death seems like tranquility
Sleeping is never pleasant
if you even sleep at all all all
You forget ideals and turn off the reason
to make sure the product gets sold
You dont UNDERSTAND how I behave just wait
I say just WAIT WAIT WAIT til your heart
I say til your hearts turns COLD

We swallow tomorrow see what we leave is hollow
We feed violence and greed let em bleed tomorrow
In time they grip a nine sippin wine hit grass

The loves gone a thugs home with no love
Feelin so strong make young boys into drug lords
Now one for adolescents now dos for dose
Keep yo friends by your side even close your foes
Now three for Johnny Law tryin to make my chips
I never pulled the trigger didnt touch that bitch
Throw yo hands in the air its a robbery
thinkin Pac would you ride with me
Lets go see what our enemies talkin bout
When Gs enter the house nobodys walkin out
This aint livin its similar to prison we trapped
My homies jealous plus they tell us that the phones is tapped
I watch my back twenty-fo seven
And never let a busta send a G to ghetto heaven you know
This is how it goes when we floss with foes
Before I toss yo hoe itll cost you mo
I do shows make a lot of dough murder my foes
But Id give it all up if it would help you grow
This aint livin
Takes a life to make a life takes a life
Livin in the world of crime tonight takes a life
Cant find a better way to break you
This aint livin I gotta do what I gotta do
Takes a life to make a life takes a life
Livin in the world of crime tonight takes a life
Cant find a better way to break you
This aint livin I gotta do what I gotta do
Peep it gunfire is produced at alarmin rates
Todays youth grip the shit get in the car and break
It Takes a Nation of Millions if we intend to stop the killin
Just search your feelings participate in some
They our seeds and when they bleed we bleed
Thats what becomes of lonely children they turn to Gs
Heavenly father can you rescue my young nation
Rest the Lord will protect you respect due
Not a threat as I step in blue and check those
That oppose when I froze them fools and who are you
To watch me fall farther
I disappeared reappeared as the follow me now
Skippin class and livin fast will get yo ass
Stuck in the pen doin life plus ten
Young brother pump yo brakes for me before you choke
Wont ya soak up some game from yo big homies
This aint livin we givin you jewels use em as tools
Explode on they industry and fade them fools
You know the rules gotta be a rider
You can run the red lights but read the street signs hey
This for all of yall that keep on raisin hell
Put a pistol in your hand and let you fade yourself
It aint right what you put your momma through young G
Gotta change your life take the game from me
This aint livin
Takes a life to make a life takes a life
Livin in the world of crime tonight takes a life

Takes a life to make a life takes a life
Livin in the world of crime tonight takes a life
Cant find a better way to break you
This aint livin I gotta do what I gotta doIf you a bad boy
If you a bad boy then you die
Westside outlawz when we ride get me high
They fed up when the rob me
Put another contract on Mobb Deep
If you a bad boy then you die
Westside outlawz when we ride get me high
They fed up when the rob me
Put another contract on Mobb Deep
I focus my locus thought on my enemies
Sip off the Hennessey its necessary to finish me
Im in this social immortal when it comes to the phone book
Jersey them ns they think Im crazy and creepy
And as we speak they tryin to find me a therapist
Rapid fire I clap and hire till you die a liar
Strap in back to the corners droppin on to spin the tires
My man define ya three hundred and fifty-seven anaconda
This enough to bring your mama then turn around and hear the drama
Havoc I gotta have it steady blastin at Prodigy
Mobb six feet deep you try to blast me till death
And I suppose you got the dopest moves like Chucky on fresh
You know the verdict who what when why he died murdered
Get your physical diverted and your vision deserted
Ever since mama got fed and papa ducked out
Look at us murderous thugs showin less love in the drug house
Similar to savage its a wonder we manage
Bring chaos causin damage on our quest for cabbage
They ask my style similar to cash we flaunt it
Most wanted by the population murdered you for it
Exploit your weakness revenge flow deep without release
Criminal orders across the waters bringin the war to the streets
Why fear me fear the s I speak
Once this s drop its heard on every fin street
Like the sound of police who run the street really
And every hood let you grow
From the hustlaz up at Harlem to the shot callers in O
And though Congress dont want us to progress our step
My homie buried at an early age hustled to death
His last breath a lesson I posses like jewels
Stay thugged out keep it movin
Halfway thugs are bugged when we stalk the streets
Sort of like thugs and narcotics when we walk the streets
You speak the big p throw down and drop it
Hit you with six shots lay the law down and throw the shells in my pocket
Getting mine with nine coked extorting
Block shots with twenty-twos with my socks with the butt hangin out the chalk
You never seen time I travel across the mean crime
My rolls like a million dollar bills folded in green slime
With my foes erased drink my henney straight no chasin
Catch my body like Haitian five minutes from the station
Hit the hole like Allen Iverson with confidence
The bigger prick dont mean no evidence or proof the I was present
At the scene of the crime around ten ns bleed
After they made this punk fag motherfer bleed
All the money was bloody as s yall ns shoulda seen it
Bust a cap and freak with bow down on your knees s
The glock to your head n dont let inside action
Hit innocent by-standers when he blasted shot fin backwards
Little homies puttin work for stripes
But is it worth your life a g-rides runnin red lights
I wish somebody would have t old me then
Since Im an outlaw like Napolean aint no cell they can hold me in
Caucasian crazy like Arabians
Hold this spot like some ns fade me in having the scene chase me
When they want the product n I got the smoke
Got the weed and the coke what you need what you want
What you working with Im some immortal s
Outlawz we straight hurtin s use artillery to murder with
Put then on the box gangsta party like Pac
Lifes hard from the ox me and my ns on top

Ridin foes cause I cant let hoes catch me slippin
Quick to blow and dispose if you block on hittin
Ridin high blazing kryptonite got a n dazing
Burpin and smurkin got on his knees before I grave em
Ride em look behind him I see him he slipped
At a stop light in a growin night this motherfen trick
Slide over so I can dip and put it in him
Damn I guess this motherfer know that I sent it
Hit the pedal now we high speeding
With the metal trying to make these motherfers die freezing
Up the way I seen him slow down
S I think Im gonna bust these hoes down
Caught them runnin on e it kind of funny to me
They know they was fin with me but they dumb to see
Open up fire watchin me spy when my shells split em
Plus all them tricks and the bes go to hell with em
F em they phony claimin they homies but the foes
Speakin on thug ns daily while we nailing they hoes
Explode boldly at my stage shows and formation
Words known to spray blaze as I raise my thug nation
Crooked thoughts cops get bought no longer caught
Did you cry when my girl died
Put out the hit politc ns worldwide grabbin my dick
Ill never learn take away the pain with sherm
Throwin gas on my enemies watchin them burn
Call my posse Im shootin up the casket take the body
Whip the corpse like a pinata and party
His last breath a straight lesson I posses like jewels
Stay thugged out keep it movin
If you a bad boy then you die
Westside outlawz when we ride get me high

To my brothers on tha block--better stay strapped black

And Ima throw a changup
Quayle like you never brought my name up
Now my homies in tha backstreets

A black song
Tellin all my brothers get they strap on
And look for me in tha struggle
Hustlin to tha other brothas bubble
Hollar if ya hear me

And the decoys
And if ya hustle like a real G
Pump ya fists if ya feel me
Hollar if ya hear me

Waitin for tha day to let tha rage free
Still me till they kill me

And get scooped up by the little homie in a regal

You got to have papers in this world
You might get your first snatch before your eyes swirl
Ya doing ya job

And then you work so hard till ya hair turn gray
Let me tell you about life and bout the way it is
See we live by the gun so we die by the blood of kids
They tell me not to roll with my glock
So now I got to throw away
Floating in the black benz
Trying to do a show a day
They wonder how I live with five shots
Niggas is hard to kill on my block
Scheme for currency and dough related
Affilliated with the hustlas
So we made it
Your answer to the question
Tryin to get up on it
My nigga dogg homie and two of the most wanted
Chorus
daz
Aint nuttin but a gangsta party until fadeSonia Sanchez
When your heart turns cold
I say when your heart turns cold
it causes your soul to freeze
It spreads throughout yo spirit
like a ruthless feeling disease
The walls the walls that once were down
now stand firm and tall safe from hate love pain joy
until you feel nothing at all
When your heart turns cold
I say when your heart turns cold
A babys cry means nothing
A dead corpose is tri-vial
Mothers neglecting children is daily
Loneliness becomes your routine friend
Death death death seems like tranquility
Sleeping is never pleasant
if you even sleep at all all all
You forget ideals and turn off the reason
to make sure the product gets sold
You dont UNDERSTAND how I behave just wait
I say just WAIT WAIT WAIT til your heart
I say til your hearts turns COLD
HA HA Cold Cold cold cold collllldI aint saying Im innocent of all this
Im just saying this song is for yall
For all the times I mess up when we mess up
Dear sister got me twisted up in prison
I miss yah crying looking at my nieces and nephews picture
They sayDont let this cruel world get yah
Kinda suspicious swearing one day you might leave me
For someone thats richer twist the cap off the bottle
I take a sip and see tomorrow
Gotta make if I have to beg and borrow
Reading love letters late night locked down and quiet
If brothers dont receive their mail
Best believe we riot eating Jack mat
Staring at walls of silence inside this cage
Where they captured all my rage and violence
In time I learned a few lessons never fall for riches
Apologizes to my true sisters far from bitches
Help me raise my black nation reparations are due its true
Caught up in this world I took advantage of you
So tell the babies how I love them precious boys and girls
Born black in this white mans world and all I heard was
Who knows what tomorrow brings
In this world where everyone lies
Where to go no matter how far I find
To let you know that youre not alone
Being born with less I must confess only adds on to the stress
Two gunshots to my homies head died in his rest shot him to death
And Left him bleeding for his family to see
I pass his casket gently asking Is there heaven for Gs
My homeboys doing life begging mama be stressing shedding tears
When her son finally ask that questions
Where my Daddy at Mama Why we live so poor Why you crying
Heard you late night through my bedroom door
Now do you love me Mama Why do they keep calling me nigger
Get my weight up with my hate and pay em back when Im bigger
Still thugging in this jail cell missing my block
Hearing brothers screaming all night wishing theyd stop
Proud to be black but why do we act like we dont love oursleves
Dont look around busta
You sucka
Check yourselves know what if means to be black
Whether a man or girl were still struggling in this white mans world
We must fight
Who knows what tomorrow brings
In this world where everyone lies
Where to go no matter how far I find
To let you know that youre not alone
So tell me why you changed choosing new direction
In a blink of an eye my time away just made perfection
You think Id die not gonna cry why should I care
Like we holding on to love thats no longer there
Can you please help me God Bless me please
Keep my seeds healthy banging on my enemies bleed
While my Gs healthy hoping they bury me
With ammunition weed and shells
Just in case they trip in heaven aint no Gs hell
Sister sorry for the pain that I caused your heart
I know Ill change if yah help me but dont fall apart
Rest in peace to Latasha Little Yummy and Kato
To much for this cold world to take ended up being fatal
Every women in America especially black
Bear with me cant you see were under attack
I never meant to cause drama to my sister and Mama
Will we make it to better times in this white man worlds
Who knows what tomorrow brings
In this world where everyone lies
Where to go no matter how far I find
To let you know that youre not aloneWe goin all out aiiiite
We goin all out aiiiite
We goin all out watch ya motherfuckin mouth niggaz
Thats right fuck these fag niggaz
Do it do it do it
Come hell or high water down to slaughter opposers
Just another lost soul stuck callin Jehovah
Outlaw til its over brand as my strap
Back like a cobra I stay drunk cause Im a mad man
Whenever sober on a one man mission
My ambition to hold up the rap game
While I pluck holes in niggaz like donuts
And still down to die for all my souljas
Like hillbillies they dont fear me
So refuse bringin war to the city
With each breath death before dishonor
Never let you swallow me no apologies your honor
A general in war Im the first to bomb
With a squad of trusted killers quick to move shit heavily armed
Im similar to Saddam sometimes I question Hussein
Like fiends frantic for that last vein stuck in the game
I hit the scene like sandstorms then transform watch me
I take the figure of dirty niggaz who all got me
While bitches wonderin who shot me
No love keep a grudge shootin sluggs like Muammar Quadaffi
Murder my friends build a new posse
We takin shots at paparazzi go and fly now nigga like Rocky
You got a lot of nerve to play me
Another gay rapper bustin caps to Jay-Z
buck buck buck buck buck buck
And still avoid capture while yall caught up in the rapture
Still after me Im in Jamacia sippin daquiris no doubt
We used to havin nothin then grabbin somethin and bustin
Wanted to be the thug-nigga that my old man wasnt
I came to a field catchin cases litigation
Niggaz playa-hatin got me crooked in all fifty states
Im screamin DEATH ROW throw my WESTSIDE aint no thang
We was raised off drive-bys brought up to bang
We claim mob MOB if you be specific
We control all cash from Atlantic-Pacific
And get this Im hard to kill when I peel with this live spot
Father how the hell did I survive these five shots
Live it up of give it up and my demons
Late night hear them screamin we goin all out
We goin all out bomb first till they fall out
Take them the war route without a doubt
Ball which means we all ride if its on
Each nigga handle ya own bring it on strong
If you got bills to pay nigga go all out
Bustas playin with ya peeps betta go all out
Tryna see the next day nigga go all out
Obstacles in ya way you better go all out
Im on my land sled walkin through the belly of the beats
Feelin like Im all out drunk as can be
Its plain to see that we mobb niggaz hidin in bushes
Claimin that they ride rough but they soft as they cushion
They softer than bitches in the worst way drownin in blood
Outlawz my blood brothers Id die for these thuggs
Say hi to this slug its a shame how some niggaz on the west coast
Was ridin with Pac but when he died they went pop
Im on the Jers to the fullest like some west coast love
But after Pac stopped rappin it aint no west coast thug
Just westcoast what To my real niggaz stuck in the street game
Cause rappers like Jay-Z be pumpin cool-Aid through they veins
Is it true what Im sayin Slap your soft ass to the floor
And watch my fo-fo put peek holes through your door

Its all from my heart when I was writin this
All out

Take them the war route without a doubt

Wanna laugh about how I got my ass caught up with this bad bitch
Thinkin I had her but she had me in the long run
Its just my luck Im stuck with fuckin with the wrong one uh
Wise decisions based on lies we livin
Scandalous times this games like my religion
You could be rollin with a thug
Instead you with this weak scrub lookin for some love
In every club
I see you starin like you want it
Well baby if you got it better flaunt it
Let the liquor help you get up on it
Im still tipsy from last night
Bumpin these walls as I pause addicted to the fast life
I try to holla but you tell me you taken
Sayin you aint impressed with the money Im makin
Guess its true what they tellin me
Fresh out of jail lifes hell for a black celebrity
So thats the reason why I call and maybe you with it
Fantasies of us sweatin can I hit it
Addicted to the things you do but still true
What Im sayin boo is this is all about you
Every other city we go

Nobody loves me Im a thug nigga
I only hung out with the criminals and drug dealers
I love niggas cause we comin from the same place
Witness me holla at a hoochie see how quick the game takes
How can I tell her Im a playa and I dont even care
Creep low weed smokes in the air
Everywhere I go its all about the groupie hoes
Waitin for niggas at the end of every show

Follow the leader and peep the drama that Im goin through

No matter where I go I see the same ho
Every other city we go

It aint about you or your bitch ass crew
Every other city we go and every video
Explain to a nigga why I see the same shitty ho
You think its all about you Well boo
I gets down like Dru and my nasty new niggas too
You couldnt hold me back itd take a fatter track
A lyrical attack perhaps it was a visual bluff
When I started to snaps all your rode em swoll
Straight in control flowsll fold while hoes cold stroll
Hold the set I told Dramacy go in next
Gold digging cold digging a gold Rolex
I slide in easily try a grizzly
Sluts know the cuts I came to fuck try skeezin me
Runnin up in ya just like Bruce Jenner when I bend ya
At the most I fucked a bitch from the west coast to West Virginia
Every other city we go
Every other video its all about you
No matter where I go I see the same ho
Every other city we go
Every other video its all about you
No matter where I go I see the same ho
Every other city we go

But youse a groupie baby and dont look surprised
I can see it in your eyes that you nuthin but a trick
Hangin with us for some superstar dick
Wanna autograph placed on her napkin
After she asks aint you the Top Dogg and dont you be rappin
She know whats crackin free shows like loot
From limos down to the Lexus Coup
We be flossin
And all females love that
Especially when youre dope platinum and you own wax
When I met you I really didnt have to say much
Cause me alone just made you wanna taste and touch
Dont be trippin if I run up to your hoe and whole crew
Im gonna still let you know girl
That its all about you you you youAight new drink

Im just tryin to turn you into motherfuckin thugs
So come and get some of this Thug Passion baby
I could pull out the drink and be good until its relevant
But Im a straight soldier

Tripping over dead presidents

Trying to clown and get a cent
And so rather than stand forever been thinking
Drinking over a felony
And hell of me and how it will be some other shit
People telling me to cool out
But they aint feeling me
A motherfucking fool about
My fucking cheddar cheese
And it pleases passion of mine
Thugging hugging plenty of Gs
And laughing while I pass through times
And all these bastards be watching
Just keep it plain
And Imma keep it the same partner just take it the simple game

Diamonds and things go blinking
Enough to hold me til Im old and wrinkling
And these adversaries
They gonna have to be worrying
Cause Imma be illing fulfilling my passion
Til Im burying my Thug Passion
I heard its the bomb
And you got it going on
Give me some of your Thug Passion baby
You got me dripping wet
From the way you make me sweat
Give me some of your Thug Passion baby
Ooh whoa

Turn this Hennessey into a robbery
The Prophecy probably suddenly
Switch and how it supposed to be and dirty money
Cant be evil cause its filling up my tummy
Born in a position death collision was futuristic
Twisting riches but there is only one way to make more
So Im standing on the corner
Trying to hustle in the snow and my bigger bro
Couldnt know but buy a forty-four blasting at playa haters wanting more
With a Thug Passion
Putting down mashin
Control by this Thugs Passion
Unlike them other bustas pistol blasting
Im asking what happened
To the niggas who kept it real
Like they claim to
Thats when I bang do see thang true
Travelling this road my poor soul has been consolidated
With all this bullshit that I done tolerated
How I made it can easily stated
Its like my heart be gripped with the Passion
To be the fucking greatest
Load up and take shit
Make it to some high dollar gangsta shit
Jack a stack til we got enough bank to split
Creep with me
Through that immortal flow
Thug Passion got you trembling like Death on the Row
Make your move
So I can throw your mind a curve
While Ill be blowing up the scene
Like my nigga Mr Herb
Take a toke as your heart goes full arrest
I got the bomb so nigga fuck the rest
You need a dub to get you flowing
And let that loc see smoke
Feeling the strokes of the nine squeeze tight and slow
I heard its the bomb
And you got it going on
Give me some of your Thug Passion baby
You got me dripping wet
From the way you make me sweat
Give me some of your Thug Passion baby
Oh whoa
They say money dont make the man
But damn Im making money
Observing you motherfuckers
Cause some of you bitches funny
Say you want it but you bullshitting
Licking them lips you got me about to act a fool quick
Sipping on some AlizÃ and Cristal
Meanwhile buy me a drink and get to winking at me
She smiles a niggas full of passion
Satisfaction is everlasting
How does it feel what Im asking
While Im rubbing on that ass
Why you laughing
See Im digging as if Im curious
Full blown and furious
Baby get a grip
When I be doing this
Its so physical
My attraction driven by alcohol
Beware of my reaction
Baby Im born to ball
Thugged out on Death Row
You better recognize and picture what I said so
Now you can feel it its a portion for my niggas in motion
Forever blasting bitches aint ready for this Thug Passion

And its a ghetto in every city and a nigga in every ghetto
I owe him thanks to my man Mike Cooley and the rest of out fathers
Motherfucker we are unstoppable
And uhh Im not goin aliveEver since I met ya I could peep the pressure
Its like your man dont understand all he does is stress ya
I can see your state of misery from the introduction
Aint bout no sucking and touching just harmless discussion
Maybe we can see a better way find a brighter day
Late night phone conversations -- would that be OK
I dont wanna take up all your time be the next in line
Tell me your size let me find you things with you in mind
I can see youre cautious and Im careful not to scare you
The anticipation of love making got you shaking when Im standing near you
News of precision will prepare ya
In case you get scared just ask the man in the mirror
Now the pictures gettin clearer all he does is hit you hard
I tell you to leave him and you tell me keep my faith in God
I dont understand I just wanna bring ya home
I wonder should I leave you alone and find a woman of my own
All the homies tell me that you dont deserve it
I contemplate but in my heart I know you worth it
Tell me Can U Get Away
So much pressure in the air I know I know
And I cant get away Just for a little while love
Im not happy here I know its hard but Can U Get Away
So much pressure in the air Lets go man get up outta there Can U Get Away
And I cant get away Do you love him
Im not happy here Do you love that man
Could it be my destiny to be lonely
Aint checkin for these hoochies that be on me cause they phony
But you was different -- I got no need to be suspicious
Cause I can tell -- my life with you would be delicious
The way you lick your lips and shake your hips got me addicted
Im sittin here hoping that we can find some way to kick it
Even though I got your digits gotta struggle to resist it
Slowly advance when its my chance not to miss it
You blow me kisses
When he aint lookin now your hearts tooken
My only wish is that you change your mind and he get shook
Wanna take you there but you scared to follow come see tomorrow
Hoping I can take you through the pain and sorrow
Let you know I care -- that someones there for your struggle
Depend on me when you have needs or theres trouble
I wanna give you happiness and maybe even more
I told you before no time to waste we can hook up at the store
Can U Get Away

He was a nice middle class nigga
But nobody knew the evil hed do when he got a little bigger
Get off the final blaze
While puffing on a Newport
Plottin on a another way to catch a case
Was only sixteen yet convicted as a felon
With a bunch of old niggas
But you the only one who aint telling
I tell you its a cold world stay in school
You tell me its a mans world play the rules
And fade fools n break rules until we major
Blaze up getting with hoes through my pager
Was raised up commencing to money makin tactics
Its getting drastic niggas got automatics
My fingers on the trigga tell the lord
To make way for another straight thug nigga
Im sitting getting buzzed looking for some luv
From the homies cause shorty wanna be a thug

Straight from the Hall to the Penn
Adolescent nigga scaling weight and standing six feet ten
He carried weight like a Mack truck
Gonna bust on some playa haters
If the mutha fuckas act tuff
Then thats when the lethal weapon with the razor
This little nigga smoking weed and getting blazed up
No one could figure when the guns blast pull the trigga
Could take the life of a young nigga guns bigger
No mother and father you see the niggas all alone
Old timers my role model the war zone
Released with this game til its a part of me
My heart dont beat no fear and it aint hard to see
The future is looking dim
Im trying to make a profit out of living in this sin
Im in the dark getting buzzed looking for some love
Out with the homies cause shorty wanna be a thug
Say hes gonna be
Said hes gonna be
One day hes gonna be
Shorties gonna be a thug

You little bad ass nigga to the young niggas
Gotta stay sharp nigga play your part
You got plenty of time you bad muthafuckas
You only get three mistakes then thats life big baby niggas crazy
Watch the signs
Damn you aint but sixteen nigga
Sixteen
Thats a bad muthafuckerStarry night an unknown creation
Written by and from the archives of Tupac Shakur
Dedicated to the memory of Vincent Van Gogh
A creative heart obsessed with satisfying
This dorment and uncaring society
You have given them the stars at night
And you have given them bountiful bouquets of sunflowers
But for you theres only contempt
Though you pour yourself into that frame and present it so proudly
This world could not accept your masterpieces from the heart
So on that starry night you gave to us and you took away from us
The one thing we never acknowledged your life
Yeah game laid down by Q whyknawmsayin
Vocals by Rasheeda fly beat by QDIII
And flows by the M-A-see whyall Mr M-A-see Mall
Starry night your life
You gave to us and took away from us
Starry night your life
You gave to us and took away from us
Uh uh watch me live my art writing words from my soul in blood
I speak the truth on every thang I love
Ill probably sacrifice my life to send my message through mics
Its like a war drum calling soldiers at night
Its bigger than music I spit it straight from the heart
So its cold n dark and deep like a universe but nah dont start
Its for ya entertainment but its my life why all
And I cant rewind fast forward or press pause
But when you give your all its like the fans demand more
And after the tour I sit alone like before
When ya name is hot its all love the world is yours
But when you fall off you get ignored
You on the cover of da magazine flossing on the TV screen
Toastin wit yo champagne playin life like a game
Loaded in the limousine love to hear the fans scream
Swimmin wit the sharks now aint no love money king
People got they hands out but aint nobody lendin hands
Can you really blame dem for tryin to get what they can
Late night bright lights lust n lies
And anythang goes under the Hollywood sign
Well you might lose ya soul and who knows what you find
But go ahead main we all want to shine
But go ahead main we all want to shine
There you have it
Whyknow when I was younger I prayed to get in this game
Whyknow to hold dis microphone in my hand
I asked the man upstairs to let me rock a crowd one day
Whyknow let people out there feel the way I feel through my music
Like my homeboy Tupac did fo sho
And he gave that to me
But he didnt he didnt he didnt let me know
About all the shady shit thats in in between
You and yo dream whyknow
See its more than the music I spit it from the heart
So sometime its cold n its dark but its raw
And thats how Ima bring it to you every time whyknowTurn it up in my head phones
Comin to a ghetto near you street fame more
Haha comin to a ghetto near you
I wasnt mad until these tricks shot me
Its time to sanitize my posse look how paranoid these niggas got me
Cellular calls are being traced since surveillance silently
Momma chill thug livin pay the bills and die violently
Closed caskets expose bastards I leave em bloody
Deloris Tucker dont let your kids hear a nigga speak
On gettin money aint nothin funny green got a nigga seein things
Why hit the lye hope to God I can fly
Lethal weapon Ima savage still a method to my madness
Blast niggas laugh call em care cabbage
Read em and weep put em to sleep they hell bound
Lyrics will leave em spell bound clown now tired of bein held down
Cross my heart hope to die blinded in some pussy millionaire
Livin care free sucka free playa haters miss me
Hope in hard times never catch me slippin
Fuck authorities they wonder why minorities be trippin
We aint havin it
Time to tear this shit back ghetto children kick back
Once I hit the mat niggas will never get this shit back
Spit it so eloquently my pistols represent me
Bust until my rounds empty back for the street fame
One love to my true thugs
Comin to a ghetto near you street fame bust
Comin to a ghetto near you street fame
All out warfare eye for a eye
Bustin on my enemies bad boy killin straight dissin you
Fuck Lil Kim you nasty bitch
Temperatures rises niggas blinded by my lyrical disguise
No time to plot retreats niggaz shiver and die
Multiple rounds found laced in his body and face
Wrapped in plastic the acid erased all traces
Criminal tactics the rap game became so drastic
Military mind mashed all the walls they blasted
If we bleed then they suffocate chokin in terror
So we strive singularize we reflect in the mirrors
The prophecy is clear niggas lock n load disappear
Strategize with no fear wagin war for years
The crack game wasnt big enough ready to rush
Bitch made motherfuckers get murdered and touched
I go to jail niggas screamin Free me speakin freely
Conversation with my comrades kickin Swahili
Indeed nature feel my first seed it gets worse
Plans are cursed to be a G on the first to breathe
Currency in stacks artillery in the back
Strapped armies we camouflaged in all black
When we attack holla out my set
Nigga tighten your jaw givin birth to outlawz
Ha ha street fame
Bust nigga bust bust
Comin to a ghetto near you hell yeah its true
Street fame
Only Makaveli the Don can put it down like this hey Nas
Comin to a ghetto near you with street fame
Positive identification got me rushed to the station
Stuck in this line up tryin hard to hide my face
They placed the name but cant recall description
I aint did shit officer that bitch trippin
Promise retaliation they plan busted no man to be trusted
Everything corrupted once man touched it
Kamikaze hopin that none of the spies find me
Thats why we bye bye daily knowin cops trail me but why cry
Floatin while we tokin on this potent branch
Flossin in the thug stance flippin pockets out inside my pants
Never underestimate me playa hate me see me and hide
Sure as hollow points shatter enemies die
Spread love dead thugs gettin buried in riches
Take a chance to advance fuck them worrin bitches
Penitentiarys a possibility bust and pray
Wear a rubber so I live to fuck another day hey

And put the game down tight
For these gamin bitches could get it right
It might be a plan that Im chosen
Dont get in confusion
Because Im known for showin examples how I do it
Thinkin Im new to this because Im younger
Where Ill only leave you suspecious and to wonder
And at the end I make a come up
Nigga was raised up off of MOB
Fetti over something thats tellin me dont run the streets
So tell me am I wrong
For tryin to communicate through a song

All my homies is waitin for me
Plottin on plans that we made and all the fun that its gonna be
So meet me at three
And dont be late nigga
We hangin out all night while drinkin straight liquor
I heard its poppin at a club
But they say I cant get in
Cause Im dressed like a thug until I die
Ill be game related
Got me strivin for a million stayin motivated
Now that we made it
Its a battle just for the big money
Im livin wild no smiles cause aint a thing funny
I came up hungry just a lil nigga tryin to make it
I only got one chance so I gotta take it
Ya never know when its all gonna happen
The rappin or the drugs
But until then give me love
And let me run the streets
You can run the streets with your thugs
Ill be waiting for you
Until you get through
Ill be waiting
You can run the streets with your thugs

I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I was raised the little young nigga doin bad shit
Talk much shit cause I never had shit
I could remember being whupped in class
And if I didnt pass mama whupped my ass
Was it my fault papa didnt plan it out
Broke out left me to be the man of the house
I couldnt take it had to make a profit
Down the block got a glock and I clock grips
Makin Gs was my mission
Movin enough of this shit to get my mama out the kitchen
And why must I sock a fella
Just to live large like Rockefeller
First you didnt give a fuck but youre learnin now
If you dont respect the town then well burn you down
God damn its a motherfuckin riot
Black people only hate police so dont try it
If youre not from the town then dont pass through
Cause some OG fools might blast you
It aint right but its long overdue
We cant have peace till the niggas get a piece too
I want Gs so you label me a criminal
And if I die I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
Here on Earth tell me whats a black life worth
A bottle of juice is no excuse the truth hurts
And even when you take the shit
Move counties get a lawyer you can shake the shit
Ask Rodney LaTasha and many more
Its been goin on for years theres plenty more
When they ask me when will the violence cease
When your troops stop shootin niggas down in the street
Niggas had enough time to make a difference
Bear witness own our own business
Word to God cause its hard tryin to make ends meet
First we couldnt afford shit now everythings free so we loot
Please dont shoot when you see
Im takin from them cause for years they would take it from me
Now the tables have turned around
You didnt listen until the niggas burned it down
And now Bush cant stop the hit
I predicted the shit in twoPacalypse
And for once I was down with niggas felt good
In the hood bein around the niggas yeah
And for the first time everybody let go
And the streets was death row
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I see no changes all I see is racist faces
Misplaced hate makes disgrace to races
We under I wonder what it take to make this
One better place lets erase the wait state
Take the evil out the people theyll be acting right
Cause both black and white are smokin crack tonight
And only time we deal is when we kill each other
It takes skill to be real time to heal each other
And though it seems Heaven-sent
We aint ready to have a black President huh
It aint a secret dont conceal the fact
The penitentiarys packed and its filled with blacks
I wake up in the morning and I ask myself
Is life worth living should I blast myself
Im tired of being poor and even worse Im black
My stomach hurts so Im lookin for a purse to snatch
Cops give a damn about a negro
Pull a trigger kill a nigga hes a hero
Mo nigga mo nigga mo niggas
Id rather be dead than a po nigga
Let the Lord judge the criminals
If I die I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
And I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
Just think if niggas decide to retaliate
Soldier in the house I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto

Bitch made ass niggas dont know my style
I could be wrong but I never got along with cops

From making niggas duck from Glocks all the time
My minds full of thoughts of ends
Im still rolling my bucket but I bought me a Benz tadow
My fake friends say they love me but I know they lie
Cause in the dark see they hearts full of homicide
My mama cried when they took me off to jail
Only me inside the cell
Straight locked up in this hell
I hear some sucka screaming like the demons inside
Will em away in the morning
Only the strong survive
I cry but in my own way
Swallow my pride pick a reason to hide
From all the niggas that die Rest in Peace
Cemetery full of brothers I buried
Its going down even now I wonder
Will I still be around my hometown is the gutter
I was born a wild came up out this dust
With my heartless style these
Niggas dont know my style
Quick to smile juvenile
Was a problem child
Try to put me in the courts
But my force was wild
Bitch made ass niggas dont know my style
These niggas dont know my style
Quick to smile juvenile
Was a problem child
Try to put me in the courts
But my force was wild
Bitch made ass niggas dont know my style

Juvenile thugs come on

And Pete and Lee young Gs
With a gift of gab and tryin to hook up with the hookers
Who was quick to stab remember mamas cooking
No school straight hookin
And tryin to get with light skinned
Cause she good looking
And jumpin over turnstiles cause we aint paying
Call the cuties cuss words but we only playing biotch
Im prayin I can get a buck no luck
I had to move around a lot
Cause my moms was stuck
I had family but I was way too wild
Had to move to the West to regain my style these
Niggas dont know my style
Quick to smile juvenile
Was a problem child
Try to put me in the courts
But my force was wild
Bitch made ass niggas dont know my style
These niggas dont know my style

And all day long lets get busyLet us pray
Heavenly Father hear a nigga down here
Before I go to sleep
Tell me who do you believe in
Who do you believe in
I see mothers in black cryin brothers in packs dyin
Plus everybodys high too doped up to ask why
Watchin our own downfall witness the end
Its like we dont believe in God cause we livin in sin
I asked my homie on the block why he strapped he laughed
Pointed his pistol as the cop car passed and blast
Its just another murder nobody mourns no more
My tear drops gettin bigger but cant figure what Im cryin for
Is it the miniature caskets little babies
Victims of a stray from drug dealers gone crazy
Maybe its just the drugs visions of how the block was
Crack came and it was strange how it rocked us
Perhaps the underlyin fact stay high explain genocide
Its when we ride on our own kind
What is it we all fear reflections in the mirror
We cant escape fate the end is gettin nearer
Who do you believe in
I put my faith in God blessed and still breathin
And even though its hard thats who I believe in
Before Im leavin Im askin the grievin who do you believe in
Cant close my eyes cause all I see is terror
I hate the man in the mirror
Cause his reflection makes the pain turn realer
Times of Armageddon murder in mass amounts
In this society where only gettin the cash counts
I started out as a beginner
Entered the criminal lifestyle became a sinner
I make my money and vacate evade prison
Went from the chosen one to outcast unforgiven
And all the Hennessy and weed cant hide the pain I feel inside
You know its like Im livin just to die
I fall on my knees and beg for mercy not knowin if Im worthy
Livin life thinkin no man can hurt me
So Im askin -- before I lay me down to sleep
Before you judge me look at all the shit you did to me my misery
I rose up from the slums made it out the flames
In my search for fame will I change Im askin
Chorus
Faith in Allah believe in me and this plastic
Cause so far I done witnessed to many dead niggas in caskets
With they chest plates stretched like elastic
And whats worse Im on front line holdin down camp still mashin
Heard my cousin one of the old heads from the block
Just came home October of ninety-five back in Yardsville stuck
with a three to five if he dont act up now he realize
If you dont stay wise then in this game you fucked
Talk to my baby girl give me the word on what she heard
One of the grimmies is snitchin Diamond a stool pigeon I talked to him
He said he didnt my man said he did in fact hes sure
Cause he just came home off of bail
Now tell me
Chorus
Who do you believe in
Is it Buddha Jehovah or Jah
Or Allah
Is it Jesus Is it God Or is just yourself
Definitely not to be imposed being a demon
Because this is the joy of believing
Men to believe in yourselves
But for sure the higher power
Resides only to ride in the heart of the true
From the soul of the man for truth never has an alibi
In the poetry or in its realm
Thats what pulls all words together
Just to understand that every man is his OWN man
And only man can satisfy the man
Only the soul of the man the feelings of the man
The for realness of the man
You cant shake the man when you feel the man you know the man
And you gotta call yourself because you are that man
Who do you believe in
I put my faith in God blessed and still breathin
Who do you believe in Put my faith in God and
Blessed and still breathin
Even though its hard Who do you believe in
Thats who I believe in Put my faith in God
Before Im leavin Even though its hard
Im askin the grievin
Before Im leavin Im askin the grievin - who do you believe in
Who do you believe in Who do you believe in
Who do you Blessed and still breathin
Oh blessed oh blessed
Before Im leavin Im askin the grievin - who do you believe in
Oh who do you
Do you believe in
Oh Oh
Who do you believe in
I put my faith in God blessed and still breathin
And even though its hard thats who I believe in
Before Im leavin Im askin the grievin - who do you believe in
Im askin Who do you believe in
Im askin you Put my faith in God
Thats who I believe in
Before Im leavin Im askin the grievin who do you believe in
Who do you believe in

Thats who I believe in
Before Im leavin Im askin the grievin
Who do you believe inI shoulda seen you was trouble right from the start
Taught me so many lessons
How not to mess with broken hearts so many questions
When this began we was the perfect match perhaps
We had some problems but we workin at it and now
The arguments are gettin loud I wanna stay
But I cant help from walkin out just a little way
Just take my hand and understand if you could see
I never planned to be a man it just wasnt me
But now Im searchin for commitment in other arms
I wanna shelter you from harm dont be alarmed
Your attitude was the cause you got me stressin
Soon as I open up the door with your jealous questions
Like where can I be youre killin me with your jealousy
Now my ambitions to be free
I cant breathe cause soon as I leave its like a trap
I hear you callin me to come back Im a sucka for love
What you wont do do for love
You tried everything but you dont give up
What you wont do do for love
You tried everything but you dont give up
Just when I thought I broke away and Im feelin happy
You try to trap me say you pregnant and guess who the daddy
Dont wanna fall for it but in this case what could I do So now Im back
To makin promises to you tryin to keep it true
What if Im wrong a trick to keep me on and on
Tryin to be strong and in the process keep you goin
Im bout to lose my composure Im gettin close
To packin up and leavin notes and gettin ghost
Tell me who knows a peaceful place where I can go
To clear my head Im feelin low losin control
My heart is sayin leave oh what a tangle web we weave
When we conspire to conceive and now
You gettin calls at the house guess you cheatin
Thats all I need to hear cause Im leavin Im out the do
Never no more will you see me this is the end
Cause now I know youve been cheatin Im a sucka for love
What you wont do do for love
You tried everything but you dont give up
What you wont do do for love
You tried everything but you dont give up
Now he left you with scars tears on your pillow and you still stay
As you sit and pray hoping the beatingsll go away
It wasnt always a hit and run relationship
It use to be love happiness and companionship
Remember when I treated you good
I moved you up to hills out the ills of the ghetto hood
Me and you a happy home when it was on
I had a love to call my own
I shoulda seen you was trouble but I was lost trapped in your eyes
Preoccupied with gettin tossed no need to lie
You had a man and I knew it you told me
Dont worry bout it we can do it now Im under pressure
Make a decision cause Im waitin when Im alone
Im on the phone havin secret conversations huh
I wanna take your misery replace it with happiness
But I need your faith in me Im a sucka for love
What you wont do do for love
You tried everything but you dont give up
What you wont do do for love
You tried everything but you dont give upLove within a storm
Love within a storm
Love within a storm
Love within a storm
First it was nothin not even a fake
Loneliness was a daily for me until you came along
There was a gleam of a star in your eyes
Thought Id never feel this way again
And you were supposed to reach my heart
And find love within love love
Ooohoooh
Love within a storm
Love within a storm
Love within a storm
Love within a storm
This sweet wonderful ghetto love
This sweet wonderful love that you give me
Wonderful
I could not ignore the magnetism when I felt you near
Any problems plaguin my mind was suddenly disappeared
It was re-birth of my heart the day that you became my friend
Cause I knew for the moment I held you that I would fall in love again
Fall in love again in a storm
Love within a storm Continues in background throughout next verses
Just when I thought Id seen it all
Our paths crossed amen
And I knew from the first glance
That you would be hard to forget
Your eyes attracted me first
But you reeked of sultry confidence
I couldnt wait to touch lips
And kiss with my hearts intention
When we didnt was what I expected
And for that moment we erased the tension
Of the awkwardness of first date jitters
And the initial blind date first impressions
We kissed again and I felt the passion
And this my love was Cupids blessin
We made love within a storm
In the midst of passion and chaos
Somewhere somehow our true bond of friendship was lost
In the eye of the storm the rain always falls harder
Those who prevail this drama
Will learn to bring their love farther
But now the storm has past
And the seas of our friendship are gone
But as long as I live I will remember
The love within a storm
Love within a storm is repeated after every line
Sweet passionate love-lusting love
Ya know that I miss you and love you
Ya know that Tupac broke my heart
We need to hear ya hear ya voice
They say this ghetto fabulous
On one hundred and twenty-fiveth street forkin around
This village and the village uptown
South Central Compton Philly
Sha-Town Southside

Talking about you getting money but its funny to me
All you niggas living bummy while you fucking with me
Im a self made millionaire thug livin out of prison pistols in the air
Biggie remember when I use to let you sleep on the couch
And beg the bitch to let you sleep in the house

Five shots couldnt drop me I took it and smiled
Now Im back to set the record straight with my AK

With fifteen shot cocked glock to your knot
Outlaw mafia click moving up another notch
And your pop stars popped and get mopped and dropped
And all your fake ass East Coast props brainstormed and locked
Youse a B writer Pac style taker
Ill tell you to face you aint nothing shit but a faker
So fill the alazhay with a chaser

E D I I mean post the scene of the caper
Like a loc with little Ceas in a choke
Toting smoke we aint no muthafuckin joke
Thug life niggas better be known be approaching
In the wide open gun smoking no need for hoping
Its a battle lost I got em crossed
As soon as the funk is bopping off nigga I hit em up
Incomprehensible
Who shot me but your punks didnt finish
Now you bout to feel the wrath of a menace
Nigga I hit em upIn todays music news the ever controversial Tupac Shakur has
Just released another album under the alias Makaveli
Music insiders are running wild trying to rearrange other artist
Street dates in fear of a wipe out in retail inter chart movement
Although no one knows the exact cause of the new album
Resources tell me a number of less fortunate rappers
Have joined together in conspiracy to assassinate the character
Of not only Mr Shakur but of Death Row records as well
Nas the alleged ring leader of it is furious at Tupac
Excuse me Makavelis verbal assault
On Mobb Sleep Notorious BIG and several other New York rappers
Jay-Z of Hawaiian Soapy fame Big Little whatever
And several other corny sounding motherfuckers
are understandably shaken up by this release
The question everybody wants to know is
Whyd they get this nigga started
Tupac rather Makaveli was not available for comment
But released this statement
Its not about East or West
Its about niggaz and bitches
Power and money riders and punks
Which side are you on
Gun cocked six shots bullets hit ground
These niggaz is still fuckin talkin

Pistol closing hands

Expose Snakes cuz they breath freely

Mos Def singing
Can you see the pride of the panther
As she nurtures her young all alone
Its the seed that must grow regardless
of the fact that its been planted in stone
Can you see the pride of the panther
In the concrete jungle alone with her cub
Its the seed that must come to harvest
Its the tree that must grow out of love
Can you see the pride in the panther
as he glows in splendor and grace
Topling obstacles placed
in the way of the progression of his race
Can you see the pride in the panther
as she nurtures her young all alone
The seed must grow regardless
of the fact that its planted in stone
Cant you see the pride of the panthers
as they unify as one
The flower blooms with brilliance and
outshines all the rays of the sun
Keeps bright like the rays of the sun
Carries out like the rays of the sun
Keeps bright like the rays of the sun
Shines bright like a new day begun

Though we exist and breathe some believe currency comes to Gs
Stresses after battle with success comes greed echo
They got me hot When they shot me
Plotted my revenge
To increase my ends
Enemies gettin dropped
Win or lose
Red or blue
We must all stay true
Play the game nigga
Never let the game play you
And for the fame
Niggas change fast
Thats a shame
Whats the game
Lost souls
Who controls our brain
Who can I blame
The world seems strange at times
Somewhat insane
Im hoping we can change with time
Im living blinded
Searching for refinement
Curse I know death follows me
But I murder him first
And worse yet
With each breathe
Steps I take
Breathless
Is there a cure for a hustler with a death wish
Cigar ashes
Coaster
Crystal glasses
We mash on them jealous bastards
With a ski mask
Im the first one to warn them
Blast it
Wrapped in plastic
Bullshitting got his ass hit outlaws
Aint nothing left now
Treated like a stepchild
Was not for me
Nothing but busters and bitches fuck em all
Be rocking beats
Fake in fame
Block run and shoot slugs
We throw them back like hardballs
Without the gloves
No love for these fake desperados
And thugs I bleed to envy
Smoke and blow out they blunts
Sipping Henney
Drunk nights
And hot days
Cocking my heat shooting it sideways
A wife on the run
Full of common blunts
Unconditionally married
To my gun
Fulfillin my destiny
On knees
And ones desires
Be pulling all my cabbage like priors
Stuck in the trance searching for something higher
Fortune and fame
One thing we all adore
Something worth dying for
Nothing but pain
Stuck in this game
Searching for fortune and fame
The one thing we all adore
Something worth dying for
Its been nothing but pain
Stuck in this game
Searching for fortune and fame
Searching for fortune and fame
Lost in the rain
A lose of the game
With life the cost of the game
We forcing the change
Mother fuck flossing the chain
All the blame
Belongs to the part of the brain
That we never use nigga
Plus my heart is in pain
And if I ever lose homey
Bet Im at it again
Outlaws dont die
So united we stand
And if family come before
All the fortune and fame
As I walk up in the crib
Laid to rest my head
Say some rhymes to angels
Hope they bless my bed
Hope they bless me the righteous way
Got a homie locked down
Outta town
I sent him a kite today
Man that hate in your heart you gotta cleanse it dog
Praying for my downfall and I can sense it dog
I was passed down the street fame
Like glock clocked and keep aim
Was raised up with a clock box
And I ran with the local street gang
They say the light is faded
But still shine in the dark
You can easy been a man
But you is a boy in your heart
And thats some game that I got
From generation of game
In the road of life dog
We need to switch up lanes
Think about it
One thing we all adore
Something worth dying for
Nothing but pain
Stuck in this game
Searching for fortune and fame
The one thing we all adore
Something worth dying for
Its been nothing but pain
Stuck in this game
Searching for fortune and fame
I cant complain
Ive seen my fair share of the fame
It wont change me
Now Ive got this piece of change
I feel strange I got so used to the hood
That when I finally got out at first it aint feel good
I was just a baby still retarded from slavery
When we struggle to shovel shit aint nobody saved me
Ghetto aint made me I made myself
Poverty raised me thinking aint no help
I pray for my health my mind and my family too
State of myself my grind and my family crew
Where one hand watches the other
No we aint blood
But we still real brothers
The struggle is real
Nothing can steal
What we build
And that remains the same
Till that day we killed
And thats real
Life that I was aimed to be
Love by my family tree
Thats fame to me
How about it
One thing we all adore
Something worth dying for
Nothing but pain
Stuck in this game
Searching for fortune and fame
The one thing we all adore
Something worth dying for
Its been nothing but pain
Stuck in this game
Searching for fortune and fameIts just me against the world
Ooh ooh
Nothin to lose
Its just me against the world baby
Oh ah ah
I got nothin to lose
Its just me against the world
Oh-hahhh
Stuck in the game
Me against the world baby
Can you picture my prophecy
Stress in the city the cops is hot for me
The projects is full of bullets the bodies is droppin
There aint no stoppin me
Constantly movin while makin millions
Witnessin killings leavin dead bodies in abandoned buildings
Carries to children cause theyre illin
Addicted to killin and the appeal from the cap peelin
Without feelin but will they last or be blasted
Hard headed bastard
Maybe hell listen in his casket the aftermath
More bodies being buried Im losing my homies in a hurry
Theyre relocating to the cemetery
Got me worried stressin my visions blurried
The question is will I live No one in the world loves me
Im headed for danger dont trust strangers
Put one in the chamber whenever Im feelin this anger
Dont wanna make excuses cause this is how it is
Whats the use unless were shootin no one notices the youth
Its just me against the world baby
Me against the world
Its just me against the world
Ooh yeah ooh-hoo
Its just me against the world
Me against the world
Cause its just me against the world baby
Hey
Me against the world
Ooh yeah
I got nothin to lose
Its just me against the world baby
I got nothin to lose
Could somebody help me Im out here all by myself
See ladies in stores Baby Capones livin wealthy
Pictures of my birth on this Earth is what Im dreamin
Seein Daddys semen full of crooked demons already crazy
And screamin I guess them nightmares as a child
Had me scared but left me prepared for a while
Is there another route For a crooked Outlaw
Veteran a villian a young thug who one day shall fall
Everday theres mo death and plus Im dough-less
Im seein mo reasons for me to proceed with thievin
Scheme on the scheming and leave they peeps grieving
Cause aint no bucks to stack up my nuts is backed up
Im bout to act up go load the Mac up now watch me klacka
Tried makin fat cuts but yo it aint workin
And Evils lurking I can see him smirking
When I gets to pervin so what
Go put some work in and make my mail makin sales
Risking twenty-five with a L but oh well
Me against the world
With nothin to lose
Its just me against the world
Ooh yeah ooh-ooh
Its just me against the world baby
Me against the world
I got nuttin to lose
Its just me against the world
Oh oh
Ha ha
Its just me against the world baby
Ha-ah ha ah
With nothin to lose
Its just me against the world baby
Me against the world ho ah
Me against the world
I got nothin to lose
Its just me against the world baby
Ha-hahh hehe heyy
With all this extra stressin
The question I wonder is after death after my last breath
When will I finally get to rest Through this suppression
They punish the people thats askin questions
And those that possess steal from the ones without possessions
The message I stress to make it stop study your lessons
Dont settle for less even the genius asks-es questions
Be grateful for blessings
Dont ever change keep your essence
The power is in the people and politics we address
Always do your best dont let the pressure make you panic
And when you get stranded
And things dont go the way you planned it
Dreamin of riches in a position of makin a difference
Politicians and hypocrites they dont wanna listen
If Im insane its the fame made a brother change
It wasnt nothin like the game
Its just me against the world
Me against the world
Nothin to lose
Its just me against the world baby
Me against the world
Got me stuck in the game
Its just me against the world
Oh ah
Id be ashamed to lose
Its just me against the world baby
Me against the world
Heh ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
Thats right
I know it seem hard sometimes but uh
Remember one thing
Through every dark night theres a bright day after that
So no matter how hard it get stick your chest out
Keep your head up and handle it
Me against the world
Me against the world
Me against the worldMos Def

From Tupac to Afeni Shakur

This is for you
One love one life
Mos Def singing
Can you see the pride of the panther
As she nurtures her young all alone
Its the seed that must grow regardless
of the fact that its been planted in stone
Can you see the pride of the panther
In the concrete jungle alone with her cub
Its the seed that must come to harvest
Its the tree that must grow out of love
Can you see the pride in the panther
as he glows in splendor and grace
Topling obstacles placed
in the way of the progression of his race
Can you see the pride in the panther
as she nurtures her young all alone
The seed must grow regardless
of the fact that its planted in stone
Cant you see the pride of the panthers
as they unify as one
The flower blooms with brilliance and
outshines all the rays of the sun
Keeps bright like the rays of the sun
Carries out like the rays of the sun
Keeps bright like the rays of the sun
Shines bright like a new day begun

After I smoke a joint come on
To keep my temper low
I parlay with my friends
Theres really no where else to go
two Pac

Rather be buried then see us party
Keep it close to my heart
Cause we the ones that got the shit started
You recollect we used to bust on snithces
Nobody come before my niggas fuck all yall bitches
All my homeboys are self sufficient
So be suspicious of your scandalous tricks
Got the police taking our pictures
Love to hang out on the corner but we known to ride
Me and my motherfucking homeboys down to die
For each other cause we closer than brothers
Its like you came in no forgetting the party popping
When my squad walks in
Throw up your hands baby buy me a drink stop acting phony
Dont forget to bring something for all my homies

When I get free motherfuckers better watch they ass
Soon as I get released Imma clock some cash

Soon as I get released Imma clock some cash
Did some time locked down but Im back on the street
Therell be trouble when they see me
Hey still sittin in my cell as I dwell on my past
Tryin to figure how a nigga turned dreams into cash
Quick call her collect aint no respect on the other side
My cellmates suicidal cause his mother died
And my CO is a lady and Im thinkin maybe
Me and her can hook up a scheme to be Swayze
Cause she keep on callin me baby to a young
Motherfucker facin eighty thats enough to make me crazy
Now how long will it take to get a hook
Got her watchin me liftin weights sneakin looks
I devised a plan Im in the trunk while she drives
But man aint no disguise Imma die as a man
If we make it then Im takin it to Hell
All them niggas that was frontin while I sat up in a cell
Locked in jail I couldnt touch her so I planned in misery
The nigga you dont wanna see
When I get free motherfuckers better watch they ass
Soon as I get released Imma clock some cash
Did some time locked down but Im back on the street
Therell be trouble when they see me
When I get free believe that shit

Fuck that Im out CO turn the fuckin lights outMalcolm Jamal Warner
Let me show you the rhyme
Excuse me - but Lady Liberty needs glasses
and so does Mrs Justice by her side
Both the broads are blind as bats stumblin through - the system
Justice bumped into MTulu trippin on Geronimo Pratt
but stepped right over Oliver and his crooked partner Ronnie
Justice stubbed her big toe on Mandela
And Liberty was misquoted by the Indians
Slavery was just a learning phase forgotten without a verdict
while Justice is on a rampage
for endangered survivin black males
I mean really if anyone REALLY valued life
and cared about the masses
Theyd take em both to Pen Optical
and get TWO pairs of glasses
Excuse me - but Lady Liberty needs glasses
Im kickin asses up and down New York City
Its a pity
Brothers wanna be grimy and gritty to each other
What would your mother think smotherin your brother
I see you sink into another level
Dancin with the devil
Turn up the bass cause Im player also a rhyme sayer
Kind of fly layer after layer
Why cause Im blessed
Cause Ive progressed
Ive learned my lessons
Class has always been in session so you better take notes

Why must you be unfaithful For women
Men you shouldnt listen to your selfish heart
It doesnt really have a brain
Besides keepin you alive its existence is in vain
And how could I be so mean and say your heart has no place
Because mortal men fall in love again
as fast as they change their face
I may be cruel but think awhile about the hearts that you have broken
and match that with the empty vows and broken promises youve spoken
Now Im not saying females are perfect
cause we know its not true
But why must you be unfaithful
if her heart is true to youRussell Simmons
Thanks for comin out God bless you good night

Little skinny kid sneakin weed in my bag lunch
And all through Junior High we was just gettin by
And drivebys robbed my homies of their young lives
I never did cry and even though I had
pain in my heart I was hopeless from the start
They couldnt tell me nothin they all tried to help to help me
The marijuana had my mind gone it wasnt healthy
I travelled places caught cases what a ill year
I felt the pain and the rain but Im still here
Never did like the police let the whole world know
Now I gets no peace cause they chasin me down
And facin me now what do I do
These thangs that a Thug goes through
And still I rise so keep ya head up and make ya mind strong
Its a struggle every day but you gotta hold on
Hold on be strong hold on
Be strong hold on
When its on its on
Hold on be strong hold on
Be strong hold on
When its on its on
Hold on be strong hold on
Be strong hold on
When its on its on
Hold on be strong hold on
Be strong hold on
When its on its on
Theres never a good day cause in my hood they
let they AKs pump strays where the kids play
And every Halloween check out the murder scene
Cant help but duplicate the violence seen on the screen
My homies dyin fore they get to see they birthdays
These is the worst days sometimes it hurts to pray
And even God turned his back on the ghetto youth
I know that aint the truth sometimes I look for proof
I wonder if heaven got a ghetto and if it does
Does it matter if you blood or you cuz
Remember how it was the picnics and the parties in the projects
Small time drinkin gettin high with them armies
Just another knucklehead kid from the gutter
Im dealin with the madness raised by a single mother
Im tryin to tell you when its on
You gotta keep your head to the sky and be strong most of all hold on
Hold on be strong hold on
Be strong hold on
When its on its on
Hold on be strong
I know them aint tears comin down your face

All respect to those who break their neck to keep their hoes in check

And I dont know why your girl keeps paging me
She tell me that she needs me cries when she leaves me
And every time she sees me she squeeze me lady take it easy
Hate to sound sleazy but tease me I dont want it if its that easy
Ay yo bust it baby got a problem saying bye bye
Just another hazard of a fly guy
You ask why dont matter my pockets got fatter
Now everybodys looking for the latter
And aint no need in being greedy
If you wanna see me dial the beeper number baby when you need me
And Ill be there in a jiffy
Dont be picky just be happy with this quickie
But when you learn you cant tie me down
Baby doll check it out I get around

You can be great
And its been this way from the cradle to the grave
So get paid
My niggaz do this every fuckin day
We parlay
Through politics and conversation
This information to my thug niggaz in the congregation
Watch and bare witness to the pleasures of participation
Separation is self destruction
Whats needed is unification
Cause the world aint hardly scared
If not prepared
Be sure to be bummy and be no longer there
But no one cares its there to share
All we get is stares
Because of fear well evaporate
Say your prayers
And whats next

Bounce wit me Cali body rock down in H-Town
We gon put these artificial bustas in they place now
Time foe a change

Some niggaz stick to the crime
Pitchin nickel and dimes

Who gon give us a job
So I tried and tried
Tried to get out the grind
But the block kept on callin me back
Fiends kept on callin for crack
So I supply em wit that
Gave em a reasonable fee
Nigga dont blame it on me
Shit just look where Im at
Niggaz in gardens
LAPD is the target
Niggaz is heartless hustle regardless
Look that dope spot use to be an apartment
But now its just a place to hide the guns in the closet
Watch ya step shift the grams under the carpet

Let me show you the rhyme
Excuse me - but Lady Liberty needs glasses
and so does Mrs Justice by her side
Both the broads are blind as bats stumblin through - the system
Justice bumped into MTulu trippin on Geronimo Pratt
but stepped right over Oliver and his crooked partner Ronnie
Justice stubbed her big toe on Mandela
And Liberty was misquoted by the Indians
Slavery was just a learning phase forgotten without a verdict
while Justice is on a rampage
for endangered survivin black males
I mean really if anyone REALLY valued life
and cared about the masses
Theyd take em both to Pen Optical
and get TWO pairs of glasses
Excuse me - but Lady Liberty needs glasses
Im kickin asses up and down New York City
Its a pity
Brothers wanna be grimy and gritty to each other
What would your mother think smotherin your brother
I see you sink into another level
Dancin with the devil
Turn up the bass cause Im player also a rhyme sayer
Kind of fly layer after layer
Why cause Im blessed

If you a bad boy then you die
Westside outlawz when we ride get me high
They fed up when the rob me
Put another contract on Mobb Deep
I focus my locus thought on my enemies
Sip off the Hennessey its necessary to finish me
Im in this social immortal when it comes to the phone book
Jersey them ns they think Im crazy and creepy
And as we speak they tryin to find me a therapist
Rapid fire I clap and hire till you die a liar
Strap in back to the corners droppin on to spin the tires
My man define ya three hundred and fifty-seven anaconda
This enough to bring your mama then turn around and hear the drama
Havoc I gotta have it steady blastin at Prodigy
Mobb six feet deep you try to blast me till death
And I suppose you got the dopest moves like Chucky on fresh
You know the verdict who what when why he died murdered
Get your physical diverted and your vision deserted
Ever since mama got fed and papa ducked out
Look at us murderous thugs showin less love in the drug house
Similar to savage its a wonder we manage
Bring chaos causin damage on our quest for cabbage
They ask my style similar to cash we flaunt it
Most wanted by the population murdered you for it
Exploit your weakness revenge flow deep without release
Criminal orders across the waters bringin the war to the streets
Why fear me fear the s I speak
Once this s drop its heard on every fin street
Like the sound of police who run the street really
And every hood let you grow
From the hustlaz up at Harlem to the shot callers in O
And though Congress dont want us to progress our step
My homie buried at an early age hustled to death
His last breath a lesson I posses like jewels
Stay thugged out keep it movin
Halfway thugs are bugged when we stalk the streets
Sort of like thugs and narcotics when we walk the streets
You speak the big p throw down and drop it
Hit you with six shots lay the law down and throw the shells in my pocket
Getting mine with nine coked extorting
Block shots with twenty-twos with my socks with the butt hangin out the chalk
You never seen time I travel across the mean crime
My rolls like a million dollar bills folded in green slime
With my foes erased drink my henney straight no chasin
Catch my body like Haitian five minutes from the station
Hit the hole like Allen Iverson with confidence
The bigger prick dont mean no evidence or proof the I was present
At the scene of the crime around ten ns bleed
After they made this punk fag motherfer bleed
All the money was bloody as s yall ns shoulda seen it
Bust a cap and freak with bow down on your knees s
The glock to your head n dont let inside action
Hit innocent by-standers when he blasted shot fin backwards
Little homies puttin work for stripes
But is it worth your life a g-rides runnin red lights
I wish somebody would have t old me then
Since Im an outlaw like Napolean aint no cell they can hold me in
Caucasian crazy like Arabians
Hold this spot like some ns fade me in having the scene chase me
When they want the product n I got the smoke
Got the weed and the coke what you need what you want
What you working with Im some immortal s
Outlawz we straight hurtin s use artillery to murder with
Put then on the box gangsta party like Pac
Lifes hard from the ox me and my ns on top
I know the law hate me dearly comin for me
We outlaws thugged out ns runnin on E
I know the law hate me dearly comin for me
We outlaws thugged out ns runnin on E
I know the law hate me dearly comin for me
We outlaws thugged out ns runnin on E

We outlaws thugged out ns runnin on E
I know the law hate me dearly comin for me
We outlaws thugged out ns runnin on E
With the leaded Pac f the law
Carry steal cause I live in the n side of the law
Ridin foes cause I cant let hoes catch me slippin
Quick to blow and dispose if you block on hittin
Ridin high blazing kryptonite got a n dazing
Burpin and smurkin got on his knees before I grave em
Ride em look behind him I see him he slipped
At a stop light in a growin night this motherfen trick
Slide over so I can dip and put it in him
Damn I guess this motherfer know that I sent it
Hit the pedal now we high speeding
With the metal trying to make these motherfers die freezing
Up the way I seen him slow down
S I think Im gonna bust these hoes down
Caught them runnin on e it kind of funny to me
They know they was fin with me but they dumb to see
Open up fire watchin me spy when my shells split em
Plus all them tricks and the bes go to hell with em
F em they phony claimin they homies but the foes
Speakin on thug ns daily while we nailing they hoes
Explode boldly at my stage shows and formation
Words known to spray blaze as I raise my thug nation
Crooked thoughts cops get bought no longer caught
Did you cry when my girl died
Put out the hit politc ns worldwide grabbin my dick
Ill never learn take away the pain with sherm
Throwin gas on my enemies watchin them burn
Call my posse Im shootin up the casket take the body
Whip the corpse like a pinata and party
His last breath a straight lesson I posses like jewels
Stay thugged out keep it movin
If you a bad boy then you die
Westside outlawz when we ride get me high
They fed up when the rob me
Put another contract on Mobb DeepHes braggin about his new Jordans
The baby just ran out of milk
Hes buyin gold every two weeks
The baby just ran out of pampers
Hes buyin clothes for his new girl
And the baby just ran out of medicine
You ask for money for the baby
What he say
The daddy just ran out the door
Girl I cant believe him I cantAlright now here we go
Tell me how many real motherfuckers feel me I smoke a blunt
And freak the funk until these jealous motherfuckers kill me
Im out the gutter pick a hero
Im one hundred and sixty-five and staying high til I die my competitions zero
Cause I could give a fuck about you better duck
Or Ill be forced to hit yo ass up I give a fuck
Im sick inside my mind why you sweatin me
Its gonna take an army full of crooked ass cops to come and get me
Niggas know I aint the one to sleep on Im under pressure
Gotta sleep with my piece an extra clip beside my dresser
Word to God Ive been ready to die since I was born
I dont want no shit but niggas trip and yo its on
Open fire on my adversaries dont even worry
Better have on a vest aim for the chest and then you buried
Its a mans world niggas get played another stray
Hope I live to see another day hey
Im getting sweated by these under covers who can I trust
Got my mama stressin thinkin its a drug bust
Gotta get paid but all the drama thats attached
We living a Drug Life Thug Life each day could be my last
Will I blast when its time to shoot Dont even ask
Thats the consequences when ya livin fast
Six bricks of tricks for my niggas I gotta come up
And recoup you keep the dope just bring me six figures
Is it a bust I hear the sirens run for cover
Over the fence and open fire Alright now here we go
These motherfuckers on my ass Im in traffic will it be tragic
Im comin round the corner like Im Magic
Doin ninety on the freeway and hittin switches
In a high speed chase with these punk bitches
Dont turn around I aint givin up cause they dont worry me
Pussy ass bitches better bury me
Runnin outta gas time to park it Im on foot
We in the hood how the fuck they gon catch a crook Haha
I got away cause Im clever
Went to my neighbors for a favor now you know players stick together
I watch the scene from the rooftop spittin loogies
At the coppers that pursue me biotch
I be a hustler til its over motherfucker
Open fire on you bustas Alright now here we go
Dont try to follow me Im headed outta state
I gotta pay my fuckin bills so Im transportin weight
Change my plates pick up my nigga and now we rollin
Droppin keys like they stolen hehe
Tell me who do you fear Im outta town until the coast is clear
Enough dope to last a year
They got me running from the police nowhere to go
With the lights out rollin down a dirt road
But I aint goin alive Id rather die than be a convict
Id rather fire on my target
I hit the corner doing ninety ah shit
Them bitches right behind me
They take a shot and hit my fuckin tires
Now jump out the car then I open fire sucka Ha ha ha thug lifeHehehe these are my words to my first born
Can you picture young nz in a rush to grow
Til hard timers in the pen had to crush his throat
Probably never even saw it comin too busy bullstin
Caught him with his mouth runnin aint this a b
They got me twisted in this game
The feds and the punk po-lice pointin pistols at my brain
I wonder if Im wrong cause Im thugged out
My homies murdered execution style runnin in the drug house
What was supposed to be a easy hit now s is flipped
Cause ns died over bulls its not my dream
Im seein pictures of a broken man no witnesses
Only the questions of who smoked the man young adolescents
In our prime live a life of crime though it aint logical
We hobble through these tryin times livin blind
Lord help me with my troubled soul
Why all my homies had to die fore they got to grow
And right before I put my head on the pillow say a prayer one love
To the thugs in heaven Ill see you there
Its written for the young and dumb that wasnt warned
Help you make it through the storm
My words to my first born feel me
My words to my first born
My words to my first born
Since my very first day on this earth I was cursed
So I knew that the birth of a child would make my life worse
And though it hurt me there was no distortion
Cause wild seeds cant grow we need more abortions
Quiet your soul cause you know what you had to do
And so did victims of a world they never came to
I understand its a better day comin
Sometimes cats be sleepin on the dead end
Drivin with the car runnin blinded
Aint no love in the hood only hearts torn
Love letters to the innocent and unborn
All the babies that died up on the table
Wasnt able to breathe cause the family wasnt able
Cant blame her I would do the same
All I could give it was my debt and my last name
Cause in the game things change livin up and down
This hard life got me walkin with my head down
Flashin frowns wasnt meant to be was I wrong
But Ill never get to know so I carry on
Its written for the young and dumb that wasnt born
My words to my first born feel me
My words to my first born
Mm Yeah These are the words to my first born
Hey n talk to your born talk to your seed n
Two thousand somethin somethin its a new era
A ns too real now see s too clear
See theres more than just this scrilla and this tilt
What else is it dawg
The velvet and the silk and makin sure my kittens got they milk
Hoo Gotta fill this mattress let my kids know Im at this
Attack this the Mack must roll hood stroll
Aint no question is it Above the Law hustlers
If its related to chips homey well handle ya
Yo
Although we never take advantage though we always into erythang
By all means stack green gangsta lean
They say money make the world go round
So only ssociate yourself with paper chasers
And nz thats truly down and keep God first
And give thanks for the good times as well as when it hurts
Its player haters every corner you hit
Touchin their tits hella thick tryin to get you for yo grip
I know you stressed out and fed up
But come out gun-blazin and keep yo head up
You can call it what you want to but it aint gon change
Above the Law twoPac OGs in this rap game
And we done lived a long hard life
And we done shed so many tears under these bright lights
Yall although we grew up corrupted and scorned
We still got a lot of wisdom to give to our first born
What you gon tell your kids n
Who was you What was you doin How did you put it down
These my words to my motherfin first born
So they can know whyknahmean He he he
Aint nothin but a motherfin rider Wessyde til I die
Thats all it was its a crooked-a hand they deal a motherfer
I just played to win just played to win
Motherfer gotta bet agains the oddsThey finally did it whats that
They stole the mic i grip
Now that its Gone whats wrong
Im feelin tired and sick
How did they do it I dont know I wasnt sleepin that long
When i woke up what happened brotha
My Microphone was gone
First I panicked how
I put the cops on the case
But they was stumped damn
Without a clue or a trace
So as sure a smoking cigarettes is bad for your health
If i want my microphone back Ill do it my self
So I picked up the phone For what
I called Dizzy Whats up
My Mics gone Wurd
Lets get Busy
Before I told Dizzy what I wanted to Do
He was over at my house with the TMS crew
He said Word is out on every mouth on the street
Now that its gone its not long til your beat
And then it hit me damn
I got a battle at six
With out my microphone
Im guaranteed to get whipped
Ya might think its unbelievable
But word to the strength
When it comes to rockin rhymes
Im a musical ninth
They Gave me other mics
But yo it wasnt no use
I tried to rock it one-two one-two
But I couldnt get loose
I said forget it
Ya microphone or not
And I got to do this
Give it all that I got Yo what if ya loose
Itd be the first time I lost
But if I beat em itd finally prove that Im the boss
I grabbed my leather jacket
Walked through the streets
Was hopin and payin
Strictly dope wont get beat
I begin to get hyped
I was ready to fight
Yo I was confident that I win
To hell with the mic
I hop on to the stage
Dizzy started the beat
The sucka shivered
Because he tasted defeat
Then I signaled to Dizzy
Bust a rhyme wit my head
Perpetrator fell back HA
And then he was dead
I was happy as hell
Cause I was lucky that night
Put my hand in my pocket
And there was my mic
Ha ha
now why you tell em that
The case of the misplaced mic
Im down with Strictly Dope
So That means Im more than you can handle
Hot Im hotter than the wax from a candle
Me Thats Rock T hes my microphone companion
Lyrics Full of knowledge truth and understandin
Hobbies Rappin is my only recreation
Retire Ya must be on some kind of medication
Why cause Ill never loosin up my mic grip
Drugs Never cause Im livin on the right tip
Sex Only with my girl because I love her
Babies Impossible I always use a rubber
Board Rarely cause Im keepin myself busy
Scratch Nah I leave the cuttin up to DizzyYoung mothers thats right
I feel ya hey
I know how it is
Mamas just a little girl
Dont nobody understand
I feel ya
She was born a heavy set girl with pigtails and curls
A heart full of gold still it wont change the world
Though she could never understand why
Some underhanded plans witnessed a man die
Was only fifteen should have been a beauty queen still
See her crying by the caskets when her parents got killed
Little girl dont cry cause even though they died
You can best believe theyre watching over thee from the sky
Never asked for this misery but look at what youre getting
Is a blessing in disguise when you find out youre pregnant
No money no home and even though youre all alone
You gots to do this on your own so baby go
I wish you luck and if you need me call
Just come to me and let me feed you all
I can understand the way it feels when youre fighting the world
Facing all this drama when mamas just a little girl
Mama dont know why
Mamas just a little girl
Living if she is or not oh
Time aint on her side
Cause mamas just a little girl mama is just a little girl
She gotta hold her head up high oh
At sixteen what a beautiful thing
The very essence of a jet-black ebony queen
And who could tell shed get pregnant at an early age what
She didnt listen had sex watch her belly raise hey
Got violated by someone she dated if this is fate
Id hate to see the seeds she created and so we waited
Though it takes time to build a body and a mind
She reclines nine months then finally its time
What do we find Little growing boy of mine
With a tortured soul addicted to a life of crime
Had no time for the growing stage
He learned his values on the streets at an early age
Watch for police dont come home why
cause mamas acting crazy at the hospital
About to have another baby like a rose from the concrete
Growing within blessed with twins
How the hell can mama raise three men
So we began closest family such insanity
A happy home from one act of inhumanity
Plus mama said they seed was corrupt it used to rub
Her belly begging to let us breathe if she loved us
Now mama since quiet sipping peppermint Schnapps
Turned the house into a spot and made her watch for cops hey
How could mama bring a thug like me into the world
She aint the cause of all this drama
Cause mamas just a little girl
Mama dont know why
Mamas just a little girl
Living if she is or not oh
Time aint on her side
Cause mamas just a little girl mama is just a little girl
She gotta hold her head up high oh
Now will she remain in the same spot
The gunshots rang they came from the caine spot
Now look here I see her clutching her son in her arms shes hurt
Her heart bleeds now she watched her seed die in the dirt
Fulfil prophecies but who could stop the grief
I walk around trying to hold the world up on top of me
Probably be an innocent man still Im the victim of a curse
What could be worse Nothing but pain since my birth
Only functions at the pen cause everybodys in
Paying back society Im guilty of a life of sin
I watch the drama occur my eyes blur before I jetted
I wonder why we all have to die before we get it
Though we shed tears so many peers Ive done buried
Worried and scared knowing Im going to see the cemetery
Must be prepared in this cold world no one cares
Knowing it aint fair but we all bear and do our share
In this land of the underhanded schemes and plans
Vivid dreams of a nigga having Gs in hand
Mama told me not to be a punk
Fuck what you talking about coward what you niggaz want hey
There aint a thing I wouldnt do for my mama in this world
Cause you know I aint mad at cha youre just a little girl
See mama is just a little girl Mama is just a little girl
Mama dont know why
Mamas just a little girl
Living if she is or not oh
Time aint on her side
They ask us why we mutilate each other like we do
They wonder why we hold such little worth for human life
Facing all this drama
To ask us why we turn from bad to worse is to ignore from which we came
mama is just a little girl
You see you wouldnt ask why the rose that grew from the concrete had damaged petals
On the contrary we would all celebrate its tenacity
We would all love its will to reach the sun
Well we are the roses we are the roses
This is the concrete this is the concrete
And these are my damaged petals and these are my damaged petals
Dont ask me why Dont ask why
Thank God nigga Thank God
Ask me how ask me how
You see mamas just a little girl hey mama
MamaHell yeah
And ugh
I started out dumb sprung off a hood rat
Listening to the radio wishing that I could rap
But nothing changed I was stuck in the game
Cause everybody in the industry was fucking me man
Listen Ive got a scheme break away do my own thing
Drop some conversation sit back and let the phone ring
Niggas they want to see me rise
ninety-seven watch me cut these motherfuckers down to size
And if I catch another case lord knows how they hate me
Got a playa in the court room please dont let them frame me
Ive been dealt a lot of bad cards living as a thug
Count my blessings dont stress in this land with no love
Maybe if they see me rolling look at all this green Im holding
I guess thats why the envious get their eye swollen
Hoping the heavenly father love a hustler
Be the hardest nigga on earth to ever bust a nut
My homies tell me have a heart fuck they feelings
Ive been trying to make a million since we started
We cold hearted niggas in masks thatll blast at the task force
Empty out my clip time to mash they asked for it
Me Makaveli Im a motherfucker
We break bread now we thug brothers huhuh
Niggas talk a lot of nonsense I choose to ignore
A war they aint ready for it huhuh

Niggaz get off your ass if you plan to be rich
Theres ten rules to the game but Ill share with you two
Know niggaz gon hate you for whatever you do
Now rule one get your cash on MOB
Thats Money Over Bitches cause they breed envy
Now rule two is a hard one watch for phonies
Keep yo enemies close nigga watch yo homies
It seemed a little unimportant when he told me I smiled
Picture jewels being handed to an innocent child
I never knew in my lifetime Id live by these rules
Initiated as an outlaw studying rules
Now papa aint around so I gotta recall
Or come to grips with bein written on my enemys wall rest in peace
Promised if I have a seed Ima guide him right

Plus the media be crucifying brothers severely
Tell me I aint Gods son nigga Mom a virgin
We got addicted had to leave the burbs back in the ghetto
Doin wild shit lookin at the sun dont pay
Criminal mind all the time wait for Judgment Day
They say Moses split the Red Sea
I split the blunt and rolled the fat one Im deadly Babylon beware
Comin from the Pharoahes kids retaliation
Makin legends off the shit we did still bullshittin
Niggaz in Jerusalem waitin for signs
God promised shes just takin her time
Living by the Nile while the water flows
Im contemplating plots wondering which door to go
Brothas getting shot comin back resurrected
Its just that raw shit nigga check it that raw shit
And I remember what my papa told me
Remember what my papa told me blasphemy
Love for dem dat steal in the name of da Lord
Dem a tell nuff lie but holdin my bird in a cloud

Should we cry when the Pope die my request
We should cry if they cried when we buried Malcolm X
Mama tell me am I wrong is God just another cop
Waitin to beat my ass if I dont go pop
Memories of a past time givin up cash
To the leaders knowin damn well it aint gonna feed us
In my brain how can you explain time in DC

They say Jesus is a kind man well he should understand
Times in this crime man my thug nation
Do whatchu gotta do but know you gotta change
Try to find a way to make it out the game
I leave this and hope God can see my heart is pure
Is Heaven just another door I leave this here
I leave this and hope God see my heart is pure
Is Heaven just another door And my people say
Love for dem dat steal in the name of da Lord
Dem a tell nuff lie but holdin my bird in a cloud

While de people in de ghetto feel nuff pain
Our father who art in Heaven

I see too many real playas fall to let these bitch niggaz to beat me
Puffy lets be honest you a punk

Remember that shit you said in vibe about me being a Thug
You can tell the people you roll with whatever you want
But you and I know whats going on
Pay back I knew you bitch niggaz from way back
Witness me strapped with macs knew I wouldnt play that
All you old rappers trying to advance

Niggas looking like Larry Holmes flabby and shit
Trying to playa hate on my shit you eat a fat dick
Let it be known this is how you made me
Love it how I got you niggaz goin crazy against all odds
I heard he was light skined stocky with a haitian accent
Jewelry fast cars and hes known for flashing whats his name
Listen while I take you back and lace this rap
A real live tale about a snitch named Haitian Jack
Knew he was working for the feds same crime different trail
Niggas picture what he said and did I mention
Promised a payback Jimmy Henchmen in due time
I knew you bitch niggaz was listening The World is Mine
Set me up wet me up niggaz stuck me up
Heard the guns bust but you tricks never shut me up
Touch one of mine on everything I own
Ill destroy everything you touch play the game nigga
All out warfare Eye For An Eye
Last words to a bitch nigga why you lie
Now you gotta watch your back nigga watch your front
Here we come gunshots to deck now you stuck
Fuck the rap game nigga nigga This MOB
So believe me we enemies I go against all odds
Puffy gettin robbed like a bitch to hide that fact
He did some shit he shouldnt have did
So we ride em for that
And that nigga that was down for me
Restin dead switch sides
Guess his new friends want him dead
Probably be murdered for the shit that I said
I bring the real be a legend or even the dead
Lord listen to me
God dont like ugly It Was Written
Hey Nas your whole damn style is weak
You heard my melody read about my life in the papers
All my run-in with authorities felonious capers
Now you want to live my life so whats the deal
Niggaz that dont ride right
Youve seen too many movies
Load em up against the wall close his eyes
Since you lie you die goodbye
Let the real life niggaz hear the truth from me
What would you do if you was me nigga against all odds
Against all oddsAlright alright people applauding
Tre
I know my heart has lied before
but now it speaks with honesty
of an invisible bond of friendship that was formed in secrecy
Coming from me this may seem hard but but to God I swear - its truth
We are friends for eternity and for-ever I will always love you
sung
What of a love unspoken
Is it weaker without a name
Does love exist without a title
because I do not share its name
Tre
All my life Ive dreamed of
of meeting one with immense beauty and
and once I found her I would charm her and
and shed be mine forever mine forever
I found her and indeed she is all that I wished for and more but she
is not charmed nor intrigued not charmed nor intrigued
Then I think to myself what can I offer her
The tears warm my eyes and blur my vision I
stick to my stance of bravado and give her
the same uninterested look that she gave me
She was so beautiful She was so beautiful
But what can I offer her
You say that youll love me forever but
but what about today
As the dusks become the dawns and the years pass on will you
love me love me the same way the same way
If so let us rejoice and bathe in this constant pleasure
If not spare my heart today and I shall recover before forever
And if my doubts and questions upset you
forgive my fragile heart forgive my fragile heart
I just wanted to know if youd love me forever before today
would start would you love me would you love me
sung
What of a love unspoken
What of a love unspoken
applause and shoutingGuess whos back
Drop the drums here it comes only got
Two minutes to bounce and every second counts
Better press wreck on your tech here we go set pass the Moet
My trickerys more slippery when wet
Wicked as I flip dont trip get a grip
Itll kick if the bass lines thick its a hit
Everybodys got a mic now its like a hobby
But more like a job cause bootleggers trying to rob me
And little man wants to be a rap star
Make papes hit skins drive a fat car
It aint easy sleazy even
Deceiving those we believe in
No benefits just tricks and chicks
Knock a pig to pick so heres a stick to lick
I shoot a gift til there aint none left
And if I find that the track sound def
I catch wreck till I lose my breath
Thats how it goes in the land of broke

Now Im sure to be rich for ninety-six
I pull my capes on tapes and make papes
Trace the bass to the tape with the baddest bass to date
I try to shake it but the pace is hard to break
Good thoughts I wait cause they hate my black take
Yeah its on and its packed in the rap race
But if ya got a black face its a rat race
I struggle to be rugged and raw Dukes
Trying to survive in the trials and lawsuits
Everybody wants to test me why me
No lie niggas cried when they try me
Giving up the roughness justice
Ima bust as Im ripping up nough hits
And guess whos back No longer trapped
Cause I snapped on the ones that held me back feel the contact
Ride the track get I grip as I flip
Ghetto wickedness I kick guess whos back
Guess whos back
Yes Im back cause I never did frontI got a head but aint no screws in it
Roll up and get swoll up

Cali Love to my true Thugs picture me now
Still down for that Death Row sound searching for paydays
No longer Dre Day arrivederci
Blown and forgotten rotten for plotting Childs Play
Check your sexuality as fruity as this Alize
Quick to jump ship punk trick what a dumb move
Cross Death Row now who you gonna run to
Looking for suckers cause you similar
Pretending to be hard oh my God check your temperature
Screaming Compton but you cant return you aint heard
Brothers pissed cause you switched and escaped to the burbs
Mob on to this new era cause we untouchable
Still cant believe that you got Pac rushing you
Up in you bless the real all the rest get killed
Who can you trust Only time reveals
Toss it up
Let me see you toss it up Toss it up
Wont you toss it up
Let me see you toss it up
Let me see you toss it up
Let me see you toss it up
Toss it up now ye ye
Toss it up now ye ye
Toss it up nowSometimes its hard to wake up in the mornin
Mind full of demons I dont wanna hear em anymore
Got me heartbroken fine so many babies screamin
Cause they seein destruction before they a see human bein
So they start smokin weed well never get our day
Until we learn to pray keep our families in shape
Cause they all broke an why do ghetto birds die
Before we learn to fly somebody elses child caught in guns
Smokin weed can all make a change
So Im told but I havent seen the change unfold
I keep hopin please if you prefer to breathe
Communities in need of people that will lead
Keep your eyes open now can only say Ill try
Until the day I die I promise to be wise
With my heart open greed brings only misery
A way to tragedy so I stay sucker free
Only a few chosen rise my ghetto queens rise
Dont be afraid to try too many of us die
For the door to open wide my brothers be wise
Stay focused on the prize though everybody dies
We can only learn to take our anger an our hate
Control our mental state settle down an just set it straight
Maybe we can learn to take a second to pump our brakes
For we said it regret it later an let it escalate
Cause by then its too just late theres so much we can take
And theres only so much someone can swallow an tolerate
Up to the point that he just breaks snaps an thats all it takes
Youd think that we was learnin from other rappers mistakes
But we aint
Its plain to go against with every artists comes the image
He portrays an a picture that he paints
But in the midst of all this anger an this angst
Never once did you hear me say Im a gangster
An I aint hear no complaints
But I know that I will always continue to grow
As long as I lead an never follow no one elses shadow
There will never be another me an that I can guarantee
Thats why the fuck I remain sucker free
To this day the game will never be the same
No matter how much fame or success they attain
There will never be another me an no matter what they do
There will never be another you
You can search but youll never find
You can try to rewind time
But in your hearts an your minds we will never die
We are forever alive an we continue growin one day at a time
Dont be caught in the publicity an caught in the hype
Rappers are regular people minus money an light
Searchin for fortune an fame an super stardom
All the jewelry all the cars whose crew is the hardest
Now the hip hop police the villains is watchin
An kids think beef is they only option
Outlaws born filthy guilty as charged
My memories could die but Makaveli lives on
You think the industry is fun an no pity with guns
An when your money is up thats when your enemies come
So if he died an came back would he try to save rap
We needin a change the drama remains
I spent my whole life fightin myself
That I cant win so Im invitin some help
An every now an then I take rights from the left
Im still just like a kid lookin for stripes on my belt
An that there is a fight in itself
So I just pray an hope God take a like to myself
No matter how much I try stay alive
Im gonna die mad still standin there in love with my pride
My heart frivolous beats we past that
Im tryin to keep some income comin in an collect on my ass cap
The rappers in the game aint changed
An I finally realized that we not in the same game
The hatin will never end so I guess Ill deal wit it
Them four five with cop killers just some steel wit it
The streets is military you gotta be a soldier
Gotta stay leery an keep your eyes on the rollers
They do what they gotta do to shackle an hold us
So we gotta do what we gotta do to keep rollin
One way at a time keep the faith in your mind
An we continue growin one day at a time damnI want to dedicate this one to Robert Yummy Sanderford
And all other lil young niggas thats in a rush to be gangstas
As a young nigga Im almost swellin in the wind
Give anything to be that innocent again when I was ten
I didnt bang but I was hangin with the homies
Tell them niggas started slangin that they dont know me
I got my hustle on learned to ignore what couldnt pay me
Lately Ive been tryin to make a bill-ion can you play me
With that jealousy they need to miss me dont sweat me
If them cowards really want me come get me and even I
Someday will die but Im cautious Im fin to ride
Put down the top now we flossin
Hit the freeway let the wind blow drop the window
Workin with a twenty sack of indo feelin good
Stop through the hood grab the young thugs
And I cant help but reminisce back when we slung drugs know its bad
But all we had was our hopes and dreams
Couldnt see unless we learned to slang dope to fiends
As young niggas
Hes the kind of G like everybody knows
As a young nigga
Hes always Gd up from head to toe
My memories as a young nigga
Always got it blown like Al Capone
Young nigga
Hes the downest G Ive ever known
Back in Junior High when we was barely gettin by when daddy died
Thats when my momma started gettin high
My neighborhood was full of drivebys couldnt survive
All our homies livin short lives I couldnt cry
Told my momma if I did die just put a blunt in my casket
Let me get my dead homies high
Come follow me throughout my history its just
Me Against the World stuck in misery as a young nigga
My only thing was to be paid
Life full of riches avoid snitched cause they shady back in the days
We always found the time to play
But thats before they taught them gang-bangers how to spray
Not just LA but in the Bay and in Chicago and even St Louis
Every stadium that I go when will they change
Stuck in the game like a dumb nigga
Remember how it was to be a young nigga
Hes the kind of G like everybody knows
As a young nigga
Hes always Gd up from head to toe
My memories as a young nigga
Always got it blown like Al Capone
Young nigga
Hes the downest G Ive ever known
Im telling you
To be young have your brains and have every and all that
Yo yall niggas dont know how good you really do got it
Motherfuckers need to just calm down
And peep what the fuck they want to do for the rest of the life
Fore you end your life before you begin your life
You dumb nigga
Now that Im grown I got my mind on bein somethin
Dont want to be another statistic out here doin nuttin
Tryin to maintain in this dirty game keep it real
And I will even if it kills me my young niggas
Break away from these dumb niggas
Put down the guns and have some fun nigga the restll come nigga
Fame is a fast thing that gang bangin
Puttin niggas in a casket murdered for hangin
At the wrong place at the wrong time no longer livin
Cause he threw up the wrong sign and every day
I watch the murder rate increases and even worse
The epidemic and diseases what is the future
The projects lookin hopeless where
More and more brothers givin up and dont care
Sometimes I hate when brothers act up I hit the weed
And I proceed to blow the track up for young niggas
Hes the kind of G like everybody knows
As a young nigga
Hes always Gd up from head to toe
My memories as a young nigga
Always got it blown like Al Capone
Young nigga
Hes the downest G Ive ever known
Hes the kind of G like everybody knows
As a young nigga
Hes always Gd up from head to toe
My memories as a young nigga
Always got it blown like Al Capone
Young nigga
Hes the downest G Ive ever known

Anonymous pictures of other niggas tryin to kiss her
Will I love her or shall I diss her

Tryin to paint a perfect picture
My memories of jealousy no longer carefree

Leaving no trace they see my face and then they buried
Bitches die in a hurry

Preoccupied with homocide my lifes in danger

Like twenty-five to life never crossed they mind
Tell me young nigga never learned a thang
Dead at thirteen cause he yearned to bang
Sniffed a lot of flowers but how could I cry
Tried to warn the little nigga either stop or die
Mercy is for the weak when I speak I scream
Afraid to sleep Im havin crazy dreams
Vivid pictures of my enemies family times
God to forgive me cause its wrong but I plan to die
Either take me in heaven and understand I was a sheep
Did the best I could raised in insanity
Or send me to hell cause I aint beggin for my life
Aint nuthin worse than this cursed-ass hopeless life

Make niggas think
And help you check a fat-ass bank
So why dont you kick some of that shit nigga only you know how
Ha feel me
Im barely standin and plus my secondhand say its midnight
Some Alize and Cristal guaranteed to get right
Like misdemeanors is a small thang
With DJ Quik in this bitch I let my balls hang
Runnin through the street lights cause we like yo nigga
Get your mobb on show em what a G like
Around the corner its like Vegas or better yet like Reno
Niggas poppin welcome to our casino cause you and me know
Hundred percent like a c-note
Lookin for a bitch thats half-black and Filipino
And when I meet her Ima offer her some indo
Tongue-kissing on the window of a pearl white limo
Dont wanna be your man Im your nigga
Touch me here Ill get bigger
While Im diggin Ill get deep into your liver
Im game type
Love fuckin bitches in the same night
My words are aphrodisiacs if you say em right
The club be poppin so Im stoppin at the Fat Burger
Look through the paper its another black crack murder
The citys full of surprises you can live or you can die
You can fuck on the first night or try in the late night
Last night last night changed it all
In the late night
Last night
I dont give a fuck where you gon be

In the late night
Last night last night changed it all
In the late night
Last night
I dont give a fuck where you gon be

In the late night
Around my way we lamp many styles get cramped
I clock rocks in the rain til my socks is damp
Aint nothin like bein a thug when I can just
Sit on the Row of Death straight knowin that Im blessed
Hussein Fatal flawless fatality
Overdosin on crime three steps from reality
Get up to get down represent your town last night
Was poppin like like cocked Glocks with hollow-tip rounds
From booty calls to bail sheets it aint no tellin
If I wake up in the county in my jail sheets
My intuitions and ambitions up in the late night
Probably involves me comin up with just to see another day
Might be me who bites the bullet
In these streets where a man journey
With crooked cops and a society who tryin to burn me
Im like a pit in a cage spittin my shells in a gauge
Deadly as AIDS niggas gettin crossed like a maze
Now picture me livin my life like a king maybe one day
Until then Im livin Monday through Sunday
Bringin the Gunplay for all these beefs and battles
When we collide Im a ride on that hide like cattle
Cowards best to skedaddle in the late night
Last night last night changed it all
Last night
I dont give a fuck where you gon be

Last night last night changed it all
Last night
I dont give a fuck where you gon be

Money and multiple gunshots are shown large amps are blown
Niggas in low-lows pursuin mo hoes then go home
The life of a California star and when you see me
In the drop-top Jag how many niggas wanna be me
Game is automatic mandatory I sell
To Live or Die I survive but with a story to tell
Cause when you gettin some riches watch for dumb bitches
They have you labelled a rapist before you get to tongue-kissing
Its a mean world nigga you strapped or be a throwaway
Will I survive the late night to see dawn of day
Nobody knows me Im a shadow
My army fatigues made for battle pockets full of ammo
Cause when Im out in the streets Im on point where the static
Too many done died from semis so now we automatic
I disappear whenever heated ride whenever needed
For my niggas up in Clentin gettin weeded
Continue to roll until Im old ride until I die
Supply long as you motherfuckers buy
My homies rolled by in a bucket but they aint short and duckin
Slappin niggas known for tellin bitches fuck it in the late night
Last night last night changed it all
Its in the late night
Last night
I dont give a fuck where you gon be

In the late night
Last night last night changed it all
Holla at me in the late night
Last night
I dont give a fuck where you gon be

And let me hit it where it counts and flee
Remember me I Get Around and Im haunted by my temptations

Doggie style steady pumpin on that ass until I blast
And then I laugh as we lay back
See I wait til you asleep and thats the payback
Cause you actin like you did somethin givin me a piece
I had you mufflin your screams in the sheets fuckin with me
A true digger that love triggers a thug nigga
Hustlin bitches like drug dealers

I try to effect by kicking the facts
And stacking much mail
Im packing a gat cause guys wanna jack
And fuck goin to jail
Cause I aint equipped to stop how I look
I dont sell ya-yo
They teachin a brother like I was in books
Follow me into a flow
Im sure you know which way to go
Im hittin em out of the dopes
So slip on the slope lets skip on the flow
Im fuckin the sluts and hoes
The bigger the butts the tighter the clothes
The gimminy jimminy grows
Then whaddya know its off with some clothes
Rowd when the crowd says hoe
That lets me know they know I can flow
Love when they come to my shows
I get up and go with skins before
When Im collecting my dough
I never respect the one that I back
The quicker the nigga can rap
The bigger the check now watch how they sweat
What kind of style is that
The style of a mack and ready to jack
I rendered up piles of black
The wacker the pack the fatter the smack
I hate it when real nigga bust
They hate when I cuss they threaten to bust
I had enough of the fuss
I bust what I bust and cuss when I must
They gave me a charge for sales
For selling the tales of young black males
Yes nigga N-I-G-G-A niggaz
Ay nigga you cant handle that shit
Pass that man
Hit that shit thats the shit
It smell like skunk skunk smell like that nigga momma
We aint nothin but some low down dirty niggaz
Keep it real nigga fuck you nigga
You aint givin me near a dime on this real motherfucker
Fuck St Ides its an Old E thing baby
Strictly some of that Hennesey
Can I drink with you fellas
Can I get it on it
Fuck you capo
You aint in baby
I tell you what
You guys are not gonna be talking
All that shit when I come back OK
We gonna say who the big mouth when I come back
Young black maleSometimes when Im alone
I cry because Im on my own
All the tears I cry are bitter and warm
They flow with life and take no form
Ah the world moves fast
and it would rather pass you on by
than to stop and see what makes you cry
Its painful so sad sometimes I cry
But no one really cares
To ask why why why
Well I cry because my heart is torn
I find it hard to carry on
And if I had an ear to confide in
I would cry amongst my treasured friends
A-but who do you know that stops that long
to help another carry on
Ah the world moves fast
and it would rather pass you on by
than to stop and see what makes you cry
Its painful so sad sometimes I cry
And no one really cares
To ask why why whyGrowing up as an inner city brotha
Where every other had a pops and a motha
I was the product of a heated lover
Nobody knew how deep it screwed me
And since my pops never knew me
My family didnt know what ta do with me
Was I somebody they despise
Curious look in they eyes
As if they wonder if Im dead or alive
Poor momma cant control me
Quit tryin ta save my soul I want to roll with my homies
A ticken timebomb
Cant nobody fade me
Packin a three hundred and eighty
And fiendin for my Mercedes
Suckers scatter
But it dont matter Im a cool shot
Punks drop from all tha buckshots tha fools got
Im tired of being a nice guy
Ive been poor all my life but dont know quite why
So they label me a lunatic
Could care less
Death or success
Is what I quest
Cause Im fearless
Now the streetz are Deathrow
Cause Ill beat you down like it aint nothin
Tha streetz are Deathrow
Cause Ill beat you down like it aint nothin
Tha streetz are Deathrow
I just murdered a man Im even more stressed
Wearin a vest
Hopein that their aimin at my chest
Much too young to bite tha bullet
Hand on tha trigga
I see my life before my eyes each time I pull it
I hope I live to be a man
Must be part of some big plan to keep a brotha in tha state
Penn
Counting pennys over tha years
Id done stacked many
Proven wrong those
Who swore Id wouldnt live till twenty
Now they gotta cope
Since its tha only thing I know
Its difficult to let it go
Im startin to loose my hair cause I worry
Hustlin to keep from gettin buried
But now I gImagine if we could go back
Actually talk to the motherfuckers that persevered hehehe
I mean the first motherfuckers that came in the slave ships
Hey excuse me excuse me whyknow Look
We back for everything you owe no longer oppressed
cause now we overthrow those that placed us in this rotten mess
But lets agree on strategy and pick out enemies right
Who stands accused of the abuse my own kind do right
Pardon not disregardin what you thinkin but you musta been the ship
cause once I rip your whole shit is sinkin
Supreme ideology you claim to hold
Claimin that we all drug dealers with empty souls
That used to tempt me to roll commit to violence
In the midst of an act of war witnesses left silent
Shatter black talon style thoughts I throw
It remains in your brain then of course it grows
Maybe even your babies can produce and rise
Picture a life where black babies can survive past five
But we must have hope quotin the reverand from the pulpit
Refuse to turn the other cheek we must defeat the evil culprit
Lace me with words of destruction and Ill explode
But supply me with the will to survive and watch the world grow
This aint bout talkin bout problems I bring solutions
Wheres the restitution stipulated through the constitution
You violated now Im back to haunt your nights
Listen to the screams of the lives you sacrificed
And in case you dont know ghetto born black seeds still grow
We comin back for everything you owe
Im comin collectin the shit that belong to me
Motherfuckers are runnin and duckin
Im a crazy nigga on a mission wit a bad mentality
Armed with missiles guns grenades
Pull out the pin free Im comin
How do you plead Mr Shakur how do you plead
How do I plead
Yes sir how do you plead
Shit you know how I plead
Cmon
Psssh
Not guilty on the grounds of insanity it was them or me
Bustin at my innocent family say they lookin for kis
I was home alone blind to the prelude
Bust in talkin bout Where is the Quaaludes What you say fool
Where in the hell is the search warrant
No feedback is what he uttered before he screamed Nigga motherfucker
Dropped me to my knees I proceed to bleed
Sufferin a rain of blows to my hands and knees
Will I survive is God watchin
I grab his gat and bust in self-defense my only option God damn
Now they got me goin to the county jail
And my family cant pay this outrageous bail
Try to offer me a deal they told me if I squeal
Move me and my people to a mansion in Brazil
Not me so this is how it ends no friends
Ill be stressed and they just repossessed my Benz
Told the judge it was self-defense he wont listen
So Im bumpin this in federal prison givin everything I owe
Im comin collectin the shit that belong to me
Motherfuckers are runnin and duckin
Im a crazy nigga on a mission wit a bad mentality
Armed with missiles guns grenades
Pull out the pin free Im comin
How do you plead Mr Shakur how do you plead
How do I plead
Yes sir how do you plead
Shit you know how I plead
Cmon

Dear baby its me again stuck inside this mad pen
Tryin to pay my debt for all my sins these is penitentiary times
Be so heavy on my mind at times its like Im livin just to die
Im livin in hell stuck in my jail cell
Stranded in the county jail waitin for my chance to post bail
I wanna be paid in large stacks and mash in fast Jags
I blast and wonder how long will I last
My memories fade when Im intoxicated
Bustas is shady
So Im dumpin on cowards crazy whenever faded

You send me money and nude pictures beggin for some sex
Stay wide open keep your eyes peeled
And my advice is keep it it real or you could die squealin
Plus I never have to worry about a visit
Cause youre there daily guards tryin to get your number
You dont dare tell me tongue kissin steady humpin
Tryin to touch you somethin fore the CO in the corner jump in
Frontin late nights reminiscin
Everybodys quiet I think somethins in the air
Prepare for the riot its padlocks in my socks
Steel from the bed springs I touch em with thug love
And then let they heads ring started a war but now Im gone

Aint no heaven for a thug nigga
Thats why we go to thug mansion
Thats the only place where thugs get in free and you gotta be a G
At thug mansion
A place to spend my quiet nights time to unwind
So much pressure in this life of mine
I cry at times I once contemplated suicide
and woulda tried but when I held that nine all I could see was my mommas eyes
No one knows my struggle they only see the trouble
Not knowin its hard to carry on when no one loves you
Picture me inside the misery of poverty
No man alive has ever witnessed struggles I survived
Prayin hard for better days promise to hold on
Me and my dawgs aint have a choice but to roll on
We found a family spot to kick it
Where we can drink liquor store and no one bickers over trick shit
A spot where we can smoke in peace and even though we Gs
We still visualize places that we can roll in peace
And in my minds eye I see this place the players go in fast
I got a spot for us all so we can ball at thugs mansion
Aint no place Id rather be
Chilren dead homies and family
Sky high iced out paradise in the sky
Aint no place Id rather be
Only place thats right for me
Chromed out mansion in paradise in the sky
Will I survive all the fights and the darkness
Trouble sparks they tell me home is where the heart is dear departed
I shed tattooed tears and couldnt sleep good
For multiple years witness peers catch gunshots
Nobody cares seen the politicians ban us
Theyd rather see us locked in chains please explain
Why they cant stand us is there a way for me to change
Or am I just a victim of things I did to maintain
I need a place to rest my head
With the little bit of homeboys that remains cause all the rest dead
Is there a spot for us to roll if you find it
Ill be right behind ya show me and Ill go
How can I be peaceful Im comin from the bottom
Watch my daddy scream peace while the other man shot him
I need a house thats full of love when I need to escape
The deadly places slingin drugs in thugs mansion
Aint no place Id rather be
Chilren dead homies and family
Sky high iced out paradise in the sky
Aint no place Id rather be
Only place thats right for me
Chromed out mansion in paradise in the sky
Dear momma dont cry your baby boys doin good
Tell the homies Im in heaven and they aint got hoods
Seen a show with Marvin Gaye last night
it had me shook drippin peppermint Schnapps with Jackie Wilson and Sam Cooke
Then some lady named Billie Holiday sang sittin there kickin it with Malcolm til the day came
Little LaTasha sho grown tell the lady in the liquor that shes forgiven so come home
Maybe in time youll understand only God can save us
When Miles Davis cuttin lose with the band
Just think of all the people that you knew in the past
That passed on they in heaven found peace at last
Picture a place that they exist together
There has to be a place better than this in heaven
So right before I sleep dear God what Im askin
Remember this face save me a place in thugs mansion
Aint no place Id rather be
Chilren dead homies and family
Sky high iced out paradise in the sky
Aint no place Id rather be
Only place thats right for me
Chromed out mansion in paradise in the sky
Aint no place Id rather be
Chilren dead homies and family
Sky high iced out paradise in the sky

These hypocrites are havin fits cause Im not buyin it
Defyin it envious because I will rebel against
any oppressor and this is known as self defense
I show no mercy they claim that Im the lunatic
But when the shit gets thick Im the one you go and get
Dont look confused the truth is so plain to see
Cause Im the nigga that you sell-outs are ashamed to be
In every Jeep and every car brothers stomp this
Im never ignorant getting goals accomplished
The underground railroad on an up rise
This time the truths gettin told heard enough lies
I told em fight back attack on society
If this is violence then violents what I gotta be
If you investigate youll find out where its comin from
Look through our history Americas the violent one
Unlock my brain break the chains of your misery
This time the payback for evil shit you did to me
They call me militant racist cause I will resist
You wanna censor somethin motherfucker censor this
My words are weapons and Im steppin to the silent
Wakin up the masses but you claim that Im violent
They claimin that Im violent
Just because we play what the people want
Violent
Just because we play what the people want
Violent

Violent
The cops cant stand me but they cant touch me
Call me a dope man cause I rock dope beats
Jacked by the police didnt have my ID
I said Excuse me why you tryin to rob me
He had tha nerve to say that I had a curfew
Do you know what time it is
Get out the fucking car or Ill hurt you
Get out the car or Ill hurt you
So here I go I better make my mind up
Pick my nine up or hit the line-up
I chose B stepped into the streets
The first cop grabbed me the other ripped my seat
They grabbed my homie and they threw him to the concrete
Ay man Aye yo ay man just cmon
What you doin man They tried to frame me
They tried to say I had some dope in the back seat
But Im a rap fiend not a crack fiend
My homie panicked Im out he tried to run
Freeze nigga I heard a bullet fire from the cops gun
My homie dropped so I hit the cop
I kept swingin yo I couldnt stop
Before I knew it I was beatin the cop senseless
The other cop dropped his gun he was defenseless
Argh fuck you Ungh
Now Im against this cop who was racist
Given him a taste of tradin places
And all this cause the peckerwood was tryin this
frame up but I came up
Now they claimin that Im violent
They claimin that Im violent
Just because we play what the people want
Violent
Just because we play what the people want
Violent
Just because we play what the people want
Violent
As I was beatin on a cop I heard a gun click uh-oh
Then the gun shot but I wasnt hit
I turned around it was my homie with the gun in hand
He shot the cop damn now hes a dead man
I said come on its time for us to get away
Lets go we gotta get the fuck outta here
They called for backup and theyll be on their way
Jumped in the car and tried to get away quick
The car wouldnt start damn we in deep shit
So we jumped out Cmon lets take the cops car
We drove a little ways thinkin that we got far
But I looked up and all I saw was blue lights
If I die tonight Im dying in a gunfight
I grabbed the AK my homie took the twelve gauge
Load em up quick its time for us to spray
Well shoot em up with they own fuckin weapons
And when we through sprayin audi then we steppin
This is a lesson to the rednecks and crooked cops
You fuck with real niggas get ya fuckin ass dropped
So here we go the police against us
Dark as dusk waitin for the guns to bust Whats next man
Whats next I dont know and I dont care
One things fo sho tomorrow I wont be here
But if I go Im takin all these punks with me
Pass me a clip G now come and get me
You wanna sweat me never get me to be silent
Givin them a reason a reason to claim that Im violent
Just because we play what the people want
Violent
Just because we play what the people want
ViolentFriends how many of us have them
Friends how many of us have them
Friends how many of us have them
Friends how many of us have them
Every since I could remember
I had friends I could depend on
Clothes to lend em
Money to spend on
But as time went by
My life got a little strange
And the rules of the game seem to change
Trust honesty and devotion
And money money money is the poison potion
Theres no way that I can even say
That this game has been good to me
Or even bad to me it had to be
Cause tragically the way this shit
Cracked off for Doggy Dogg was magically
And now Im gettin everything Im supposed to get
But my friendship with niggas always ends up as bullshit
I listen to my momma though
She always tried to prepare me
But how could she do what I
I mean Im do or die
But my life on the streets
That shit is suicide
So to cope I got a dogg and a locc
And keep my heat close in case these jokes go for broke
Im mashin with the click two-one-three that is
They my homeboys ever since kids
Real friends to the end
Chorus
Hangin out with my homies and Im feelin just fine
Ive been ponderin lately
A lot of different things on my mind
It seems lately my friends list
Done took a slight decline
And if you wanna know the trith man man
Them wasnt no friends of mine
You jackin me up you takin my cash
All my life L-B-C for my city I mash
All those OGs and BGs and wannabes and L-O-Cs
The only friends I got is my two-one-threes
Thats my nigga Snoop D Woop and my nigga N-A-T-E
I cant forget about my nigga H to the Deezy
Pressure and strikes
Dont wanna take no lives
But these jaws cracks and hood cracks
Will make you break bizacks
Whats up homie can I borrow some cash
Last week I gave you five hundred so kiss my ass

A familly to see through
And shake busta snitches tweekin like you

Peter stepped from the ship to the sea
there was hope for Job like a cut down tree
I hope that theres such hope for me
dust be on my minds conceptions
and anything I thought I knew
each word of my lips description
and on all that I compare to You
the preference of the sun was
to the south side of the farm
I planted to the north in a terra-cotta pot
blind as Id become I used to wonder where you are-
these days I cant find where youre not
mines been a yard carefully surgace level tended
foxes burrowed underground
my gardening so highly self-recommended
what could I have done but let you down
the sun and the moon
I want to see both worlds as One
mines been a vivid story dimly remembered
and by the hundredth time its told halfway true
of bad behavior well engendered
what good is each good thing we think we do
find a friend and stay close and with a melting heart
tell them whatever youre most ashamed of-
our parents have made so many mistakes
but may we forgive them and forgive ourselves
the sun and the moon are my Fathers eyes One two
To a nigga nature
Hehe
No need to cry now go wipe your tears
Be a woman why you actin surprised
You showed the bullshit commin fake hair
fake nails fake eyes too
So why you bound to fuck wit fake guys too
aint nothin hard about it
Why you lookin sad shoulda though about it
Say you learn i truly doubt it
I guess you got a problem with affection kinda loose with the love
Gettin freaky with the thug niggaz up in the club
Ask to buy you a drink you holla Don Perione spellin
Knowin Im a cash dealer still I remain calm
Let you chill with me
Plus you was smilin til the bill miss me
Thats what you get for trynna dick me
Missed me with that buy me this buy me that- syndrome shit
Bitch get a job if you want to be rich
Gettin mad cause i cursed and i screamed i hatecha
Introduced you to a nigga nature feel me
Chorus
Probably too nice at first
I lettin you kiss where it hurts
Me and you gettin busy slangin dick in the dirt
Met you at a pool party it was cool to kick it
See us toungkissin you was trouly with it
Little Exstacy Hennesey mix with me
Picture me pray for pussy when the dicks for free
Hey now where my niggaz at Tell these hoes
Before I pay I jerk off word to Moses
Visions of you sittin there sweaty and wet
Pointin at the places that you want me to hit
Give me room all up in the room call the cops
Nigga hit them walls til the bastard drop
Label me Makaveli - Thug Nigga with pipe
Livin life as a Rock Star friday nights
Make money get pussy
Always keep a pager cell-phone in the ride
To complete my Nature now
Started as a seed from the semen
Straight outta Papas nuts lustin for creamin
Bitches wit big butts curves make a nigga cry tits and shit
When Im locked down beggin you for porno fleeks
Sneak weed in helped a nigga passed the time
With my name tattood so that ass is mine
Tell everybody Pac put it down for good
A local legend through the whole hood
Follow me I got a gun on me
Goin for nun on the run baby
You know a nigga need some is my son crazy

It aint my fault thats a nigga nature

I was raised the little young n doin bad s
Talk much s cause I never had s
I could remember being whupped in class
And if I didnt pa mama whupped my a
Was it my fault papa didnt plan it out
Broke out left me to be the man of the house
I couldnt take it had to make a profit
Down the block got a glock and I clock grip
Makin Gs was my mission
Movin enough of this s to get my mama out the kitchen
And why must I sock a fella
Just to live large like Rockefeller
First you didnt give a f but youre learnin now
If you dont respect the town then well burn you down
God damn its a motherfin riot
Black people only hate police so dont try it
If youre not from the town then dont pa through
Cause some OG fools might blast you
It aint right but its long overdue
We cant have peace till the nz get a piece too
I want Gs so you label me a criminal
And if I die I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
Here on Earth tell me whats a black life worth
A bottle of juice is no excuse the truth hurts
And even when you take the s
Move counties get a lawyer you can shake the s
Ask Rodney LaTasha and many more
Its been goin on for years theres plenty more
When they ask me when will the violence cease
When your troops stop shootin nz down in the street
Nz had enough time to make a difference
Bear witness own our own business
Word to God cause its hard tryin to make ends meet
First we couldnt afford s now everythings free
So we loot please dont shoot when you see
Im takin from them cause for years they would take it from me
Now the tables have turned around
You didnt listen until the nz burned it down
And now Bush cant stop the hit
Predicted the s in twoPacalypse
And for once I was down with nz felt good
In the hood bein around the nz yeah
And for the first time everybody let go
And the streets is death row
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I see no changes all I see is racist faces
Misplaced hate makes disgrace to races
We under I wonder what it take to make this
One better place lets erase the wait state
Take the evil out the people theyll be acting right
Cause both black and white are smokin crack tonight
And only time we deal is when we kill each other
It takes skill to be real time to heal each other
And though it seems Heaven-sent
We aint ready to have a black President huh
It aint a secret dont conceal the fact
The penitentiarys packed and its filled with blacks
I wake up in the morning and I ask myself
Is life worth living should I blast myself
Im tired of being poor and even worse Im black
My stomach hurts so Im lookin for a purse to snatch
Cops give a damn about a negro
Pull a trigger kill a n hes a hero
Mo n mo n mo nz
Id rather be dead than a po n
Let the Lord judge the criminals
If I die I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
And I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto

And now Im in the rap game like the crack game I got enemies
Cant pretend to see my friends are not my enemies
And even thug muthafuckas wanna have fun
Stuck it buckin my muthafuckin Magnum what does it take to be a G
Silence is a must violence is a plus plus shots at my adversaries

Yeah nigga thug life from now till the muthafuckin ever
Have notz in this muthafucka
Yeah no doubtAgainst an attacker I will boldly take my stand
Because my heart will show fear for no man
But for a broken heart I run with freight
Scared to be blind in a vulnerable night
I believe this fear is in every man
Some will acknowledge it others will fail to understand
There is no fear in a shallow heart
Because shallow hearts dont fall apart
But feeling hearts that truly care
Are fragile to the flow of air
And if I am to be true then I must give my fragile heart
I may receive great joy or you may return it ripped apartChorus
Stay showing loving to my hustlers and thugs
And this is for the righteous only for the righteous
Stay with your man baby this is
For the righteous only for the righteous
Niggaz never understand the game I got it mapped out

Never been a mask out ride to riches
This game is vicious understand how the rhymes are wicked
Before we kick it lets get some understandin boo

Lyrics full of knowledge truth and understandin
Hot beats rappin is my only recreation
Retire you must be one some kind of medication
Why because I never loosen up my mic grip
Drugs no because Im livin on the right tip
Sex only with my man because I love him
Babies impossible we always use a rubber
Bored rarely cuz I keep myself busy
Scratch nah I leave the cuttin up to dizzy
Dizzy yeah thats my DJ hes the greatest
Word nah he just payin me to say this
The most cultivatin treasure
Thanks your welcome signed to its my pleasure
Chorus
You know when I first met Tupac
We were both on the road both new on the road
I was with Ice Cube he was with Digital Underground
The first time I met a young brother who had so much power then
You know we were on the road for a long time together
I had the opportunity to dream with Tupac
Before his dreams became a reality
He used to always talk about music you know
And Im just so happy so thankful to be a part of this project
It touches my heart to be able to give something back
Chorus Shit Im a changed man
Ay turn the lights out
Big baller twoPac up in this bitch
Whyknow how we swing this shit look
By age sixteen I sold to dopefiends
Not yet a drug dealer but I watched em closely
Until they noticed me I got the feds wonderin who broke the law
Far too inhibited for gunsmoke I broke his jaw
Words harder than a fuckin diamond
Mobile phone call to Simon niggas trippin homey when we ridin
Fuck them slowly like Jodeci
And stick a needle in my eye if I dont live and die for MOB
And fuck your homeboys nigga we can drop the guns
I hit your block and we can box for fun
Nigga one on one last to fall is a baller cat
Its Death Row why the fuck you think we call it that
So if you knew me in my past life
Dont act like we homeboys aint no love in the fast life
I switch gears on them jealous bitches who do you fear

Changed manAs real as it seems the American Dream
Aint nothing but another calculated schemes
To get us locked up shot up back in chains
To deny us of the future rob our names
Kept my history of mystery but now I see
The American Dream wasnt meant for me
Cause lady liberty is a hypocrite she lied to me
Promised me freedom education equality
Never gave me nothing but slavery
And now look at how dangerous you made me
Calling me a mad man cause Im strong and bold
With this dump full of knowledge of the lies you told
Promise me emancipation in this new nation
All you gave my people was our patience
Fathers of our country never cared for me
They kept my answer shackled up in slavery
And Uncle Sam never did a dam thing for me
Except lie about the facts in my history
So now Im sitting hear mad cause Im unemployed
But the governments glad cause they enjoyed
When my people are down so they can screw us around
Time to change the government now panther power
Chorus
Panther power
Panther power
Panther power
Coming straight that resides within
Go toe to toe with a panther and you just cant win
Suffered fame bats suppressed the rest
The rich get richer and the poor take less
The American Dream was an American nightmare
You kept my people down and refuse to fight fair
The Klu Klux Klan tried to keep us out
Besides drew they know no blacks allowed
With intimidation and segregation was a way for our freedom
But now were impatient
Blacks the other skin dead or sell outs
Freedom equality then Ill yell out
Dont you ever be ashamed of what you are
Its ya panther power that makes you a star
Panther power
Chorus
Panther power
Panther power
Panther power
My Mother never let me forget my history
Hoping I was set free chains never put on me
Wanted to be more than just free
Had to know the true facts about my history
I couldnt settle for being a statistic
Couldnt survive in this capitalistic
Government cause it was meant to hold us back
Using ignorant drugs to sneak attack
In my community think of unity
But when I charged them tried to claim immunity
I strike America like a case of hard disease
Panther power is running through my arteries
Try to stop oh boy youll be clawed to death
Cause Ill be fighting for my freedom with my dying breath
Do you remember that is what Im asking you
You think you living free dont let me laugh at you
Open your eyes realize that you have been locked in chains
Said you wasnt civilized and stole your name
Cause some time has passed seem you all forget
There aint no liberty to you and me we all aint free yet
Panther power
Chorus
Panther power
Panther power
Panther power
As real as it seems the American Dream
Aint nothing but another calculated schemes
To get us locked up shot up back in chains
To deny us of the future rob our names
Kept my history of mystery but now I see
The American Dream wasnt meant for me
Cause lady liberty is a hypocrite she lied to me
Promised me freedom education equality
Never gave me nothing but slavery
And now look at how dangerous you made me
Calling me a mad man cause Im strong and bold
With this dump full of knowledge of the lies you told
Promise me emancipation indispute nation

So now Im sitting hear mad cause Im unemployed
But the governments glad cause they enjoyed
When my people are down so they can screw us around
Time to change the government now panther power
Chorus
Panther power
Panther power
Panther powerNow of course I want peace on the streets but realistically
Paintin perfect pictures aint never worked my misery
Was so deep couldnt sleep through all my pressures
In my quest for cash I learned fast usin violent measures
Memories of adolescent years there was unity
But after puberty we brought war to our community
So many bodies droppin its gotta stop I wanna help
But still Im steppin keep my weapon must protect myself
The promise of a better tomorrow aint never reached me
Plus my teachers was too petrified in class to teach me
Sippin Thunderbird and grape Kool-Aid callin Earl
Since my stomach was empty it seduced me to fuck the world
Watch my lil homies lose they childhoods to guns
Nobody cries no more cause we all die for fun
So why you ask me if I want peace if you cant grant it
Niggas fightin cross the whole planet so it could never be peace
Will there ever be peace or are we all just
Headed for doom still consumed by the beast
And I know therell never be peace
Thats why I keep my pistol when I walk the streets
Cause there could never be peace
Somebody owes me will they control me Not
I aint a hater player but I want all you got
Yall babies had babies now we fightin each other
My dawgs got rabies they bitin each other
And it aint hard to find a friend like mine
Bigfully is a bullet and he dont mind dyin
And I gotta be blind missed sign after sign
Time after time after time after time
And I dont like nobody they dont like me more
And Im good with that finally but it heard it before
Dawg we livin in a prison losin our religion
On Thanksgiving we thankful just for livin in hell
Damn homey I dont mean to be harsh
But theres a devil in the ghetto tryin to tear it apart
And if we make it up out we still stuck in the dark
Will there ever be peace Just a piece of my heart never
The only peace we got is the peace of our heart
Peace of our mind or that damn piece
That we hold in our waistline
You feel me dawg Cmon uh
So will there ever be peace or are we all just
Headed for doom still consumed by the beast
And I know therell never be peace never
Thats why I keep my pistol when I walk the streets
Cause therell never be peace
Thangs is changin nigga you better read the signs
Im only concerned about me and mine in these times
The world is a ghetto and peace is not a part of it
We all believe Gods new plan to make it out of this
Niggas spendin too much time hatin on each other
Niggas buyin guns loadin em up aimin at each other
And the victim is you and me its sick but its true indeed
The good die mostly over bullshit repeatedly
Deep in me theres a part that wants nothin but love
But the rest of me know war is whats waitin for us
So I stays ready keep my pay heavy and boss up
Stack my funds and my guns never rely on luck
Asking God to point out the impostor
Never let no weapon formed against me prosper
Cause therell never be peace so dont rely on it
Soldiers dyin for it and in the ghetto
They cryin for it but fuck peace
Will there ever be peace or are we all just
Headed for doom still consumed by the beast
And I know therell never be peace
Thats why I keep my pistol when I walk the streets
Fool therell never be peace
Will there ever be peace or are we all just
Headed for doom still consumed by the beast
And I know therell never be peace
Thats why I keep my pistol when I walk the streets
Nigga therell never be peace
Will there ever be peace or are we all just
Headed for doom still consumed by the beast
And I know therell never be peace
Thats why I keep my pistol when I walks the streets
Nigga therell never be peace
Will there ever be peace
Shit fuck peace
On the strength til my niggas get a piece we cant have peace
How the fuck we gon live happy when we aint got nuttin
You muhfuckers are smilin but Im mean muggin
Why cause I gotta be thuggin
It seems drugs done turned this whole motherfuckin hood out
All us niggas actin up wild-ass motherfuckin adolescents
These niggas aint even got no childhoods no more
How the fuck can you have a childhood
And you at the funeral every muhfuckin weekend
Pssh and you muhfuckers talkin about peace
Nigga it aint no motherfuckin peace
You aint seen the news motherfucker You aint heard
Lil babies gettin smoked muhfuckers killin they whole family
Lil kids gettin thrown off buildings muhfuckers gettin abused

Til you motherfuckers clean up this mess you made
Till you fuckin clean up the dirt you dropped
Til we get s piece fuck peace WestsideThe blind stares
Of a million pairs of eyes
Lookin hard but wont realize
That they will never see
The P
You must be goin blind
Give me my money in stacks
And lace my bitches with nine figures
Real niggas fingers on nickle plated nine triggas
Must see my enemies defeated
I catch them
While they coughed up and weeded
Open fire
Now them niggas bleedin
See me in flesh
And test
And get your chest blown
Straight out the west dont get blown
My adversaries cry like hos
Open and shut like doors

Nigga you aint know
They got me stressed out on Death Row

Visions of cops and sirens

Buncha Thug Life niggas on the rise
Until I die
Ask me why Im a Boss Player gettin high
And when Im rollin by
Niggas Cant C Me
The stares of a million pairs of eyes
And youll never realize
You cant C Me
Been gettin word that these square motherfuckers with nerves
Saying they can get with us
But picture me gettin served
My own mama say Im thugged out

As if it was a drug house
My lyrics bang like a Crip or Blood
Nigga what

And there I was
A young nigga with heart
Aint had shit to loose
Pullin my pistol on them fools
You know the rules
D-R-E you got me heated
My words like a penitentiary dick
Hittin bitches where its most needed
Money and weed
Alize and Hennesse
To my Thug niggas in lock down

Bail on these hos in floss mode
The life of a Boss Player
Fuck what ya thought tho
My enemies deceased
Die like a bitch
When my album hit the streets
Niggas Cant C Me
Niggas Cant C Me
The stares of a million pairs of eyes
And youll never realize

Think crack had you fiendin waitll they get a load of me
Bitches on my dick like a motherfuckin conda

While your bitch is callin me tellin me to come again
Nigga Im loced when I smoke from the indo

Thanks to Poppa for supplyin the dank
Now its money in the bank

Compared to this shit
Fuck yall punk bitches
Tha LunaticPerhaps I was addicted to tha dark side
Some where inside my childhood witnessed my heart die
And even though we both came from the same places
The money and the fame made us all change places
How could it be through the misery
That cant get past the hard times
Made a true friend afraid to ask for currency
But you could run to me when you need me Ill never leave
I just needed someone to believe in as you can see
Its a small thang through and true
What could I do Real homies help ya get through
And coming new hed do tha same thang if he could
cause in the hood true homies make you feel good
And happy times we be acting up call tha cops
Bringing the cease to tha peace that was on my block
It never stop when my mama ask me will I change
I tell her yeah but its clear Ill always be tha same
Until the end of time
So take these broken wings
Use your hands to come and heal me once again Until the end of time
So I can fly away until the end of time
Until the end of time until the end of time
Please Lord forgive me for my life of sin
My hard stare seem to scare all my sisters kids
So you know I dont hang around tha house much
Diss all night money making got me outta touch shit
Aint flashed a smile in a long while
An unexpected birth worst of the ghetto childs
My attitude got me walking solo
Ride out alone in my low-low
Watching the whole world move in slow-mo
For quiet times disappear to the ocean
Smoking Ports think my thoughts
Then its back to coasting
Who can I trust in this cold world
My phony homey had a baby by my own girl
But I aint trippin Im a player
I aint sweating him
I sex his sister had her mo good like a Mexican
His next of kin
No remorse it was meant to happen
Besides rapping the only thing I did good was scrapping
Until the end of time
So take these broken wings
Use your hands to come and heal me once again Until the end of time
So I can fly away until the end of time
Until the end of time until the end of time
So take these broken wings
Use your hands to come and heal me once again Until the end of time
So I can fly away until the end of time
Until the end of time until the end of time
Now whos to say if I was right or wrong
To live my life as an outlaw all along
Remain strong in this planet full of playa haters
They conversate but Death Row full of demonstrators
And in tha end drinking henessy made all my enemies envy me
So cold when I flow eliminating easily
Falls to they knees they plead for they right to breath
While beggin me to keep the peace haha
Well I can see close into achieve
In times of danger dont freeze time to be a g
Follow my lead I supply everything you need
An ounce of game and the trainin to make a g
Remember me as an outcast outlaw
Another album out thats what Im about more
Gettin raw till the day I see my casket
Buried as a g while tha whole world remembers me
Until the end of time
So take these broken wings
Use your hands to come and heal me once again Until the end of time
So I can fly away until the end of time
Until the end of time until the end of timeI wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I was raised the little young nigga doin bad shit
Talk much shit cause I never had shit
I could remember being whupped in class
And if I didnt pass mama whupped my ass
Was it my fault papa didnt plan it out
Broke out left me to be the man of the house
I couldnt take it had to make a profit
Down the block got a glock and I clock grips
Makin Gs was my mission
Movin enough of this shit to get my mama out the kitchen
And why must I sock a fella
Just to live large like Rockefeller
First you didnt give a fuck but youre learnin now
If you dont respect the town then well burn you down
God damn its a motherfuckin riot
Black people only hate police so dont try it
If youre not from the town then dont pass through
Cause some OG fools might blast you
It aint right but its long overdue
We cant have peace till the niggas get a piece too
I want Gs so you label me a criminal
And if I die I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
Here on Earth tell me whats a black life worth
A bottle of juice is no excuse the truth hurts
And even when you take the shit
Move counties get a lawyer you can shake the shit
Ask Rodney LaTasha and many more
Its been goin on for years theres plenty more
When they ask me when will the violence cease
When your troops stop shootin niggas down in the street
Niggas had enough time to make a difference
Bear witness own our own business
Word to God cause its hard tryin to make ends meet
First we couldnt afford shit now everythings free so we loot
Please dont shoot when you see
Im takin from them cause for years they would take it from me
Now the tables have turned around
You didnt listen until the niggas burned it down
And now Bush cant stop the hit
I predicted the shit in twoPacalypse
And for once I was down with niggas felt good
In the hood bein around the niggas yeah
And for the first time everybody let go
And the streets was death row
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I see no changes all I see is racist faces
Misplaced hate makes disgrace to races
We under I wonder what it take to make this
One better place lets erase the wait state
Take the evil out the people theyll be acting right
Cause both black and white are smokin crack tonight
And only time we deal is when we kill each other
It takes skill to be real time to heal each other
And though it seems Heaven-sent
We aint ready to have a black President huh
It aint a secret dont conceal the fact
The penitentiarys packed and its filled with blacks
I wake up in the morning and I ask myself
Is life worth living should I blast myself
Im tired of being poor and even worse Im black
My stomach hurts so Im lookin for a purse to snatch
Cops give a damn about a negro
Pull a trigger kill a nigga hes a hero
Mo nigga mo nigga mo niggas
Id rather be dead than a po nigga
Let the Lord judge the criminals
If I die I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
And I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
Just think if niggas decide to retaliate
Soldier in the house I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghettoHa ha what you say

You devils are so two faceted
Wanna see me locked in chains dropped in shame
And gettin stalked by these crooked cops a-gain

When I was comin up rough that wasnt even what you called it
Thats why I smoke blunts now and run with alcoholics
Im gettin threats to me comin from my enemies
And in they dreams its Hell where they sendin me
Have I lost control or just another soul
A car full of motherfuckers when we roll
Sippin on yak as I sit back YES life as a big mack
Brothers come up and say You did that uh uh uh
Never take yo eyes off the prize and even if you gettin high

But when I get my check they takin tax out
So we payin for these pigs to knock the blacks out
Aint that a bitch some officers are gettin rich
Whoopin on thugs and robbin drug dealers for they shit
As far as jealousy bein a celebrity
No matter who committed the crime they all yell at me
And the media is greedier than most
You could sell em your soul or theyll be on ya til a niggas ghost
And everyday I read the paper theres another lie
They show my picture for the crimes of another guy
Now hows that for the life of a big shot

DedicatedNiggas fucking with the wrong nigga
My seductive introduction be specific still elusive
But exclusives what I give you when I kick it and Im still lifted
Niggas cant get with Mr Wicked
Picture me flipping my adversaries gettin the dick swiftly
Niggas are swinging wild but they styles miss me
You can bring that bitch but you whole clickll still get treated shitty
Business never personal Im up before the sun come up on thai
Just a ghetto star a dropped up double-R is what Im riding
Nigga if you was half the man your bitch was bring you artillery
When you come for me cause we sick thugs
No hesitation when I pull and blast cause Syke was busting
Plus bow had em ducking screaming Get they cash
So now I got the law on me my phones tapped
So I had to send word through my little homies
Tell them niggas this the year when they pull the trigger
Shit this is what you get for fucking with the wrong nigga
This is what you get when you fucking with the wrong nigga
Hehe hehe yeah nigga peep it
Before I lay me down to sleep I pray and thank the Lord
For giving me another fruitful day
I wanna be a peaceful man but still when niggas come for me
All I can see is getting em killed
For real its how I feel reflect my thoughts flowing on these reels
Make my enemies deal with my steel they caps peeled
We still cool but you played yourself
Give him the mac and make him spray hisself hey
Falling legends clutching chrome three-five-seven
Puttin two bullets to they dome wanted to die in heaven
Why call in shots nobody really as clear as me
Aint trying to help the feds get a case for conspiracy
Murder my foes get disposed of
We all homies to the death so my true niggas show me love
God forgive me for my lifestyle a negative figure
But why they fucking with the wrong nigga you know
Its like why you fucking with the wrong nigga
I was raised by thugs schooled by killers
Learned my mathematics skills from real drug dealers
Tried to rise but they tried me
I guess they all had to die cause we tried peace
I die in these streets blast til they recognize
Still do or die all my niggas gettin high watching time fly
Best strategize on the way to profit
Best organize how you ride so they cant stop it
Then keep it poppin lot of busters wanna see me fall
I fucked your bitch and now this new shit gonna fade em all
My niggas ball made a call for some backup
For little homies and my dogs in the black truck
Buck buck was the sound as they gats burst
No need for ambulance baby bring the black hearse
Shouldve never fucked around buster how you figure
Makin moves on the wrong nigga is what it sounds like
Ding ding ding when you fuck with the wrong nigga
Niggas gettin hit when they fuck with the wrong nigga
Fucking with the wrong niggaAh yeah

You probably crooked as the last trick
Wanna laugh about how I got my ass caught up with this bad bitch
Thinkin I had her but she had me in the long run
Its just my luck Im stuck with fuckin with the wrong one uh
Wise decisions based on lies we livin
Scandalous times this games like my religion
You could be rollin with a thug
Instead you with this weak scrub lookin for some love
In every club
I see you starin like you want it
Well baby if you got it better flaunt it
Let the liquor help you get up on it
Im still tipsy from last night
Bumpin these walls as I pause addicted to the fast life
I try to holla but you tell me you taken
Sayin you aint impressed with the money Im makin
Guess its true what they tellin me
Fresh out of jail lifes hell for a black celebrity
So thats the reason why I call and maybe you with it
Fantasies of us sweatin can I hit it
Addicted to the things you do but still true
What Im sayin boo is this is all about you
Every other city we go
Every other video its all about you
No matter where I go I see the same ho
Every other city we go
Every other video its all about you
No matter where I go I see the same ho
I make a promise if you go with me
Just let me know Ill have you hollerin my name out before I leave
Nobody loves me Im a thug nigga
I only hung out with the criminals and drug dealers
I love niggas cause we comin from the same place
Witness me holla at a hoochie see how quick the game takes
How can I tell her Im a playa and I dont even care
Creep low weed smokes in the air
Everywhere I go its all about the groupie hoes
Waitin for niggas at the end of every show
I just seen you in my friends video
I never put a bitch before my friends so here we go
Follow the leader and peep the drama that Im goin through
Its all about you
Yeah nigga
Its all about you
Every other city we go
Every other video its all about you
No matter where I go I see the same ho
Every other city we go
Every other video its all about you
No matter where I go I see the same ho
Is you sick from the dick or is it the flu
It aint about you or your bitch ass crew
Every other city we go and every video
Explain to a nigga why I see the same shitty ho
You think its all about you Well boo
I gets down like Dru and my nasty new niggas too
You couldnt hold me back itd take a fatter track
A lyrical attack perhaps it was a visual bluff
When I started to snaps all your rode em swoll
Straight in control flowsll fold while hoes cold stroll
Hold the set I told Dramacy go in next
Gold digging cold digging a gold Rolex
I slide in easily try a grizzly
Sluts know the cuts I came to fuck try skeezin me
Runnin up in ya just like Bruce Jenner when I bend ya
At the most I fucked a bitch from the west coast to West Virginia
Every other city we go
Every other video its all about you
No matter where I go I see the same ho
Every other city we go
Every other video its all about you
No matter where I go I see the same ho
Every other city we go
Every other video its all about you
No matter where I go I see the same ho
Every other city we go
Every other video its all about you
No matter where I go I see the same ho
Every other city we go
I see the same hoes in the studio
Or kickin it in the video

But youse a groupie baby and dont look surprised
I can see it in your eyes that you nuthin but a trick
Hangin with us for some superstar dick
Wanna autograph placed on her napkin
After she asks aint you the Top Dogg and dont you be rappin
She know whats crackin free shows like loot
From limos down to the Lexus Coup
We be flossin
And all females love that
Especially when youre dope platinum and you own wax
When I met you I really didnt have to say much
Cause me alone just made you wanna taste and touch
Dont be trippin if I run up to your hoe and whole crew
Im gonna still let you know girl
That its all about you you you youDee tha Mad Bitch
What goes on in the mind of a bad boy Nothin but payback
Whos next the clip callin murder could nothin the contract
Better watch your back
Since hes makin that comeback
The one-eighty-seven will stop em
The hollow point will drop ya
Go on heres a scene for your soul
So take heed when you meet face-to-face here comes the grim reaper
You better from the depths of hell
Hes a real McCoy
But aint no stoppin this girl is bad boy
He aint no joke
Muthafucka grab your throat
Before you find yourself cut with a blade
As your bloody body lays on top of cement
In front of your president
It was a murder for hire
Hit an innocent child in the crossfire
Now hes confined to a jail
Got shot six times in his spine
But his mind is still down at the grind
Hes willin to destroy
Thats what he lives for to be a bad boy
Chorus
Bad Boy Bad Boy watcha gonna do
Watcha gonna do watch out we commin at you
Bad Boy Bad Boy watcha gonna do
Watcha gonna do were comin after you
Bad Boy Bad Boy watcha gonna do
Watcha gonna do watch out we comin at you
Bad Boy Bad Boy watcha gonna do
Watcha gonna do watch out we comin at you

I got these bustas on my block and they after me
Runnin round tellin these niggas how they gonna capture me
Its gettin crazy its hard to make my mind up
Now should I buck em down or put my nine up
You see I aint a bad boy just a boy who had it bad

Chorus
Dee tha Mad Bitch
Now how many bad boys in the house
So hurry boys got the biggest nuts
What the fuck I gave em the blunts
Havin a grudge against the whole fuckin world
A sixteen shot-block-glock thatll stop em
Theyre sure to hit the ground
Nothin bustin a cap on no more every round
A bad boy is the big shot on the block
He got knots bigger rocks for the cops
Before he gets props
So you petty boys you cant fuck with em
You can eat the biggies good friend
Or become a victim of a dead man
Its sad to see when you end up six-feet deep
So rest in peace muthafucka join the pow
he got nothin but the realest style
Flavors when on the mic
and packin the meal like life
Savers sweep up on you at night
His grip on tight and make you take a bite
Thats all she wrote barrel went down your throat
Killin off these niggas for fun
Murder one and throw away your gun
Hes livin his life like a soldier
Thats what he lives for to be a Bad Boy
ChorusYou are appreciated
When I was a youngin and ma mama had me
Seventeen years old kicked out on the streets
Though back at the time I never thought Id see her face
Aint a woman alive that could take my mamas place
Suspended from school and scared to go home I was a fool
With the big boys breakin all the rules
I shed tears with my baby sister
Over the years we was poorer than the other little kids
And even though we had different daddys the same drama
When things went wrong wed blame mama
I reminisce on the stress I caused it was hell
Huggin on my mama from a jail cell and high school elementary
Hey I see the penitentiary one day
And runnin from the police thats right
Mama catch me put a whoopin to my backside
And even as a crack theme mama
You always was a black queen mama
I finally understand for a woman it aint easy
Tryin to raise a man you always was committed
A poor single mother on welfare tell me how ya did it
Theres no way I can pay you back
But the plan is to show you that I understand you are appreciated
Lady dont cha know we love ya Sweet lady
Dear mama place no one above ya sweet lady
You are appreciated dont cha know we love ya
Now aint nobody tell us it was fair
No love from my daddy cause the coward wasnt there
He passed away and I didnt cry cause my anger
Wouldnt let me feel for a stranger
They say Im wrong and Im heartless but all along
I was lookin for a father he was gone
I hung around with the Thugs and even though they sold drugs
They showed a young brother love
I moved out and started really hangin
I needed money of my own so I started shaggin
I aint guilty cause even though I sell rocks
It feels good puttin money in your mailbox
I love payin rent when the rents due
I hope ya got the diamond necklace that I sent to you
Cause when I was low you was there for me
And never left me alone because you cared for me
And I could see you comin home after work late
Youre in the kitchen tryin to fix us a hot plate
Ya just workin with the scraps you was given
And mama made miracles every thanksgivin
But now the road got rough here alone
Youre tryin to raise two bad kids on your own
And theres no way I can pay you back
But my plan is to show you that I understand you are appreciated
Lady dont cha know we love ya Sweet lady
And dear mama place no one above ya sweet lady
You are appreciated dont cha know we love ya
Pour out some liquor and I reminisce cause through the drama
I can always depend on my mama
And when it seems that Im hopeless
You say the words that can get me back in focus
When I was sick as a little kid
To keep me happy theres no limit to the things you did
And all my childhood memories
Are full of all the sweet things you did for me
And even though I act crazy
I gotta thank the Lord that you made me
There are no words that can express how I feel
You never kept a secret always stayed real
And I appreciate how you raised me
And all the extra love that you gave me
I wish I could take the pain away
If you can make it through the night theres a brighter day
Everything will be alright if ya hold on
Its a struggle everyday gotta roll on
And theres no way I can pay you back
But my plan is to show you that I understand you are appreciated
Lady dont cha know we love ya Sweet lady
And dear mama place no one above ya sweet lady
You are appreciated dont cha know we love ya
Sweet lady and dear mama
Dear mama lady lady ladyAy what time is it nigga

Just another sunny day in California
I got my mind focused on some papers while Im into sexy capers
Give a holla to them hoochies last night that tried to rape us
Will these rap lyrics take us plus room all up in Vegas
Im a boss playa death before I let these bitches break us
Last night was like a fantansy AlizÃ and Hennessy
A hoochie and her homie dirty dancin with my man and me
Told her I was interested picture all the shit we did
I got her hot and horny all up on me what a freaky bitch
First you argued then I fight it til you lick me where I like it
Got a nigga all excited it dont matter just dont bite it
I never got to check out the scence
Too busy tryin to dig a hole in your jeans
Now it seems its check out time

We gotta go Yall know what time it is Ay cmon man get yall bags man
We gotta go call that valet motherfucker tell him to get a nigga shoe

They label me an outlaw so its time for the panty raid
My fantansies came true with Janet on Im in a escapade
But did it all end too soon
All the homies runnin through the halls room to room
So I assume since Im a playa like my nigga Syke
Then its only right for me to disappear into the night
My games trump tight so I find time to recline
Sneak in your room instant Messiah shit wines of all kinds
I aint got that much time
So hurry up and pop the Dom and let me hit it from behind
Since Im only here for one night I got to get you hot and heated
Play like Micheal Jackson and beat It
One more thing I like to mention Im done and Im out
Cause theres someone else who deserves my attention
So all the homies round up in the lobby
Cause bustin bitches is a hobby nigga
Its check out time
We gotta go ayo man Pac ay

If walls could talk theyd say you tried to fade me

Carressin your thoughts cause Im livin Fed
Heard what I said Passion is crashin the room
From the liquor we consumed I heard a boom
Im blackin out youre yellin out Big Syke Daddy
We did it in the caddy on the highway my way
Im lost in a dream and so it seemed to be the night
Five bottles of Cristal and Im still tight
Out of sight from Pac and Kurupt

In a heaty sticky situation

Hmm yeah yeah hey heyDominique Street Science youre on the air
What do you feel when you hear a record like Tupacs new one
I love Tupacs new record
Right but dont you feel like that creates
A tension between East and West
Hes talking about killing people
I had sex with your wife and not in those words
But hes talking about I want to see you deceased
No doubt to live and die in LA
California what you say about Los Angeles
Still the only place for me that never rains in the sun
And everybody got love
To live and die in LA where everyday we try to fatten our pockets
Us niggas hustle for the cash so its hard to knock it
Everybody got they own thing currency chasing
Worldwide through the hard times warrior faces
Shed tears as we bury niggas close to heart
What was a friend now a ghost in the dark cold hearted bout it
Nigga got smoked by a fiend trying to floss on him
Blind to a broken mans dream a hard lesson
Court cases keep me guessing plea bargain
Aint an option now so Im stressin cost me more
To be free than a life in the pen
Making money off of cuss words writing again
Learn how to think ahead so I fight with my pen
Late night down Sunset liking the scene
Whats the worst they could do to a nigga got me lost in hell
To live and die in LA on bail my angel sing
To live and die in LA its the place to be
Youve got to be there to know it what everybody want to see
Its the City of Angels and constant danger
South Central LA cant get no stranger
Full of drama like a soap opera on the curb
Watching the ghetto bird helicopters I observe
So many niggas getting three strikes tossed in jail
I swear the pen the right across from hell I cant cry
Cause its on now Im just a nigga on his own now
Living life Thug style so I cant smile
Writing to my peoples when they ask for pictures
Thinking Cali just fun and bitches
Better learn about the dress code be	s and sees
All them other niggas copycats these is Gs
I love Cali like I love woman
Cause every nigga in LA got a little bit of Thug in him
We might fight with each other but I promise you this
Well burn this bitch down get us pissed
To live and die in LA
Let my angel sing
Chorus
Cause would it be LA without Mexicans
Black love brown pride and the sets again
Pete Wilson trying to see us all broke Im on some bullshit
Out for everything they owe remember K-DAY
Weekends Crenshaw M-L-K
Automatics rang free niggas lost they way
Gang signs being showed nigga love your hood
But recognize and its all good where the weed at
Niggas gettin shermed out
Snoop Dogg in this motherfucker perved out MOB
Big Suge in the Low-Low bounce and turn
Dogg Pound in the Lex wit a ounce to burn
Got them Watts niggas with me O-F-T-B
They got some hash took the stash left the rest for me
Neck bone Tre Head Ron Punchy too
Big Rock got knocked but this ones for you
I hit the studio and drop a jewel hoping it pay
Getting high watching time fly to live and die in LA
Let my angel sing
Chorus
This go out for nine hundred and twenty-three and one hundred and six
All the radio stations that be bumping my shit
Making my shit sells quadruple quitraple platinum
This go out to all the magazines that supported me
All the real motherfuckers
All the stores the mom and pop spots
AR people all yall motherfuckers

FlipBoy Ye its just us against the world
Can you picture my prophecy
Stress in the city the cops is hot for me
The projects is full of bullets the bodies is droppin
There aint no stoppin me
Constantly movin while makin millions
Witnessin killings leavin dead bodies in abandoned buildings
Carries to children cause theyre illin
Addicted to killin and the appeal from the cap peelin
Without feelin but will they last or be blasted
Hard headed bastard
Maybe hell listen in his casket -- the aftermath
More bodies being buried -- Im losing my homies in a hurry
Theyre relocating to the cemetary
Got me worried stressin my visions blurried
The question is will I live No one in the world loves me
Im headed for danger dont trust strangers
Put one in the chamber whenever Im feelin this anger
Dont wanna make excuses cause this is how it is
Whats the use unless were shootin no one notices the youth
Its just me against the world baby
Chorus
Have u ever thought of livin life in a blur
when your emotionally scarred and u cant be heard
every word sounds absurd and deep down your hurt
waiting for a hero of life to emerge
to take away all the pain struggle misery and trouble
but first if u could go back in time in reverse
and change everything bad and erase the worse
all is solved in one word
and its us against the world
Ive seen so many thing in my life that caught my eye
the soldier who fights back but in the end he dies
and when he dies noone even cries
noone asked why he died
they just patrionise him for being real
he was the real deal but he wasnt the man of steel
he had the appeal to make people kneel
his identity revealed he was so concealed
he didnt what to feel so he chose to steal
he didnt know how two change he didnt know how two heal
he found another way of life and accepted his guilt
now he stands tall as the soldier he built
never gonna fall never could be tilt
he has an army that he uses as a shield
not sending his men to war he sits and wields
not cheating his way through life he would never cheat
cause im that guy whos just looking four peace
its just me against the world
Chorus
Have u ever thought of livin life in a blur
when your emotionally scarred and u cant be heard
every word sounds absurd and deep down your hurt
waiting for a hero of life to emerge
to take away all the pain struggle misery and trouble
but first if u could go back in time in reverse
and change everything bad and erase the worse
all is solved in one word
and its us against the world
With all this extra stressin
The question I wonder is after death after my last breath
When will I finaly get to rest Through this supression
they punish the people thats askin questions
And those that possess steal from the ones without possesions
The message I stress to make it stop study your lessons
Dont settle for less - even the genius asks-es questions
Be grateful for blessings
Dont ever change keep your essence
The power is in the people and politics we address
Always do your best dont let the pressure make you panic
And when you get stranded
And things dont go the way you planned it
Dreamin of riches in a position of makin a difference
Politicians and hypocrites they dont wanna listen
If Im insane its the fame made a brother change
It wasnt nuttin like the game
Its just me against the world
Chorus
Have u ever thought of livin life in a blur
when your emotionally scarred and u cant be heard
every word sounds absurd and deep down your hurt
waiting for a hero of life to emerge
to take away all the pain struggle misery and trouble
but first if u could go back in time in reverse
and change everything bad and erase the worse
all is solved in one word
and its us against the world
Outro twoPac
Through every dark night theres a bright day after that
so keep your chess up head up and handle itA coward dies a thousand deaths
A soldier dies but once
They say pussy and paper is poetry power and pistols
Plotting on murdering motherfuckers fore they get you
Picturing pitiful punk niggas copping pleas
Puffin weed as I position myself to clock Gs
My enemies scatter in suicidal situations
Never to witness the wicked shit that they was facing
Pockets is packed with presidents pursue your riches
Evading the player hating tricks while hitting switches
Bitches is bad-mouth cause brawling motherfuckers is bold
But yall some hoes the game should be sewed
Im sick of psychotic society somebody save me
Addicted to drama so even mama couldnt raise me
Even the preacher and all my teachers couldnt reach me
I run in the streets and puffin weed wit my peeps
Im ducking the cop I hit the weed as Im clutching my glock
Niggas is hot when I hit the block what if I die tonight
If I die tonight
If I die tonight
If I die tonight
Tonights the night I get in some shit
Polishing pistols prepare for battle pass the pump
When I get to popping niggas is dropping then they done
Calling the coroner come collect the fucking corpse
He got it by killer preoccupied with being boss
Revenge is the method whenever stepping keep a weapon close
Adversaries are overdosed over deadly notes
Jealous niggas and broke bitches equal packed jails
Hit the block and fill your pockets making crack sales
Picture perfection pursuing paper with a passion
Visions of prisons for all the pussies that I blasted
Running with criminals individuals with no remorse
Try to stop me my pistol posses using deadly force
In my brain all I can think about is fame
The police know my name a different game aint a thing changed
Im seeing cemetery photos of my peers
Conversatin like they still here if I die tonight
If I die tonight
If I die tonight
If I die tonight
Tonights the night I get in some shit
Pussy and paper is poetry power and pistols
Plotting on murdering motherfuckers fore they get you
Pray to the heavens three-fifty-sevens to the sky
And I hope Im forgiven for Thug Living when I die
I wonder if heaven got a ghetto for Thug niggas
A stress free life and a spot for drug dealers
Pissing while practicing how to pimp and be a player
Overdose of a dick while drinking liquor when I lay her
Pistol whipping these simps for being petrified and lame
Disrespecting the game praying for punishment and pain
Going insane never die live eternal who shall I fear
Dont shed a tear for me nigga I aint happy here
I hope they bury me and send me to my rest
Headlines reading murdered to death my last breath
Take a look picture a crook on his last stand
Motherfuckers dont understand if I die tonight
If I die tonight
If I die tonight
If I die tonight
Tonights the night I get in some shit
like a mother-fuckin Jew throws cashUh world wide mob figgaz for real

World wide mob figga let me see a nigga nuts hangI would share the definition of ballin with you white folks
But now the game if for the soldier not so fuck you
Im up before the sunrise first to hit the block
Little bad mothafucka with a pocket full of rocks
Learn to throw them thangs get my skinny little ass kicked
And niggas laugh til tha first mothafucka got blasted
I put the nigga in his casket
Now they coverin the bastard in plastic
I smoke blunts on a regular buck when it counts
Im tryin to make a million dollars outta quarter ounce
And gettin lost on the five-o fuck them hos
Got a forty-five screamin bout survival
Hey nigga can I lay low cook some yay-yo
Hollar one-time when I say so
Dont want to go to the pen Im hittin fences
Narcs on a nigga back missin me by inches
And they say how do you survive weighin one-sixty-five
In a city where the skinny niggas die
Tell Mama dont cry
Even when they kill me
They can never take the game from a young G
Im straight ballin
Straight ballin
Straight ballin
Still on parole and Im the first nigga servin
Pour some liquor on the curb for my niggas that deserve it
But if I want to make a million gotta stay dealin
Its kinda boomin and today Ill make a killin
Dressin down like Im dirty but only on the block
Its a clever disguise to keep me runnin from the cops
Ha Im gettin high I think Ill die if I dont get no ends
Im in a bucket but Im ridin it like its a Benz
I hate to stip but let my music bump
Drinkin liquor and Im lookin for some hos to fuck
Rather die makin money than live poor and legal
As I slang another ounce I wish it was a kilo
I need money in a major way
Time to fuck my Beyatch Hey and gettin paid
You other mothafuckas fallin
But me and my mothafuckin thug niggas
We straight ballin
Straight ballin
Straight ballin
Damned if I dont and damned if a nigga do
So watch a young mothafucka pull a trigga just to raise up
But dont let them see you cry - dry your eyes
Young nigga time to do or die
I keep a pistol in my pocket
Ready on my block
Aint no time for a nigga to even cock it - shit
And I done seen that mothafucka beat pain
At point blank range cause he slept on the game
Aint a damned thing changed
Shakin the dice now roll em
If you cant stand pain better hold em
Cause aint no tellin what you might roll
You might go catch AIDS from a slight cold nigga
Best to live your life to the fullest
Be quick to kill a fool got a pistol mothafucka better pull it
Cause even when they kill me
They can never take the game from a young G
We straight ballin
Straight ballin
Straight ballin
To my niggas in the penitentiary
Locked up like a mothafucka when they mention me
Cause you fuckin with the realest mothafucka ever born
And once again its on
Im bustin on these bitches till they gone
Who the hell can you get to stop me
Im in the projects parlaying with my posse
I keep my glock cocked
I need it cause theyre all shady
I finally made it
Now these jealous bitches tryin to fade me
I aint goin out Id rather blast back
Im on the corner with my niggas watchin cash stack
And I came up a long way from food stamps
And takin shit from the low-life ghetto tramps
Could you blame me If they sweat me Im a open fire

See you in the crossroads real soon
For now let me pour out some brew
Ill be always thinkin of ya homie
Rest in peace how long will they mourn me
We know lifes a fuckin trip
And everybody gotta go
But why the fuck it have to be my nigga Kato
Another nigga fell victim to the chrome
Its enough to make you crazy its fuckin with my dome
You only live once on this earth a nigga had it bad
Since the day of my motherfuckin birth uh
But niggas say they down and they always be my homie
But when a nigga gone how long will ya mourn me
Yeah I wish it would have been another Mac ten in this motherfucker yeah
How long will you mourn me
How long will they mourn my brother Thug Life boy Nate blowin that shit
I wish it would have been another Nate Dogg do that shit nigga yeah
How long will you mourn me
How long will they mourn my brother This for my nigga Kato and all his kids
How long will you mourn me
I wish it would have been another
How long will they mourn my brotherThey got a nigga shedding tears reminiscin on my past fears
Cause shit was hectic for me last year
It appears that Ive been marked for death
My heartless breath the underlying cause of my arrest
My life is stressed and no rest forever weary
My eyes stay teary for all the brothers that are buried in the
cemetery
Shit is scary how black on black crime legendary
But at times unnessecary Im gettin worried
Teardrops and closed caskets the three strikes law is drastic
And certain death for us ghetto bastards
What can we do when were arrested but open fire
Life in the pen aint for me cause Id rather die
But dont cry through your despair
I wonder if the Lord still cares for us niggaz on welfare
And who cares if we survive
The only time they notice a nigga is when he clutchin on a four-five
My neighborhood aint the same
Cause all these little babies goin crazy and they sufferin in the game
And I swear its like a trap
But I aint given up on the hood its all good when I go back
Hoes show me love niggaz give me props
Forever hop cause it dont stop on my block
Now shits constantly hot on my block it never fails to be gunshots
Cant explain a mothers pain when her son drops
Black male slippin in hail when will we prevail
Fearin jail but crack sales got me livin well
And the systems sucidal with this Thugs Life
Stayin strapped forever strapped in this drug life
God help me cause Im starvin cant get a job
So I resort to violent robberies my life is hard
Cant sleep cause all the dirt make my heart hurt
Put in work and shed tears for my dead peers
Mislead from childhood where I went astray
Till this day I still pray for a better way
Cant help but feel hopeless and heartbroke
From the start I felt the racism cause Im dark
Couldnt quit the bullshit make me represent
Hit the bar and played the star everywhere I went
In my heart I felt alone out here on my own
I close my eyes and picture home on my block
And I cant help but wonder whhhy so many young kids had to die
Caught strays from AKs and the driveby
Swollen pride and homicide dont coincide
Brothers cry for broken lives mama come inside
Cause our block is filled with danger
Used to be a close knit community but now were all cold strangers
Time changes us to stone them crack pipes
All up and down the block exterminatin black life
But I cant blame the dealers
My mamas welfare check has brought the next man chrome wheels
Shits real I know ya feel my tragedy
A single mother with a problem child daddy free
Hangin out pickin up game sippin cheap liquor
Gamin the hoochies hopin I can get to sleep with her
Its a mans world stayin strapped
Fantasies of a nigga livin phat but held back
Pipe dreams can make the night seem hopeless
Wide eyed and losin focus on my block
And block parties in tha projects lastin way past daylight
A young nigga learned to break nine
Used to play fight with my homies but they stuck in the pen
I send them ends but its tough on a friend in my mind
I see the same motherfuckers ballin
Alcohol will make a lazy nigga slip and fall miss his call
I know the young niggaz understand this
Growing up in this world where everything is scandalous
I reminisce on tha fast times past crimes
Tryin to cop a slice of pizza with my last dime
Cant explain just what attracts me to this dirty game
Gold chains some extra change and the street fame
And whats strange is that everybody knows my name swear they all
know me
And lots of cash make a nigga change
I hit the green just to maintain feelin pain
For all the niggaz that I lost to the game from my blockAh yeah
Uh
Uh
Hollar if ya hear me
Yeah
Here we go
Turn it up
Lets start
From block ta block
Were snatchin hearts
And jackin marks
And tha punk police cant fade me
And maybe
We can have peace someday G
But right now I got my mind set up
Lookin down tha barrell of my nine
Get up
Cause its time to make tha pay back phat
To my brothers on tha block--better stay strapped black
And accept no substitutes
I bring truth to tha youth tear tha roof off tha ol school
Oh no I wont turn tha other cheek
In case ya cant see us while we burn the other week
Now we gotta make it smash
Blast
How long will it last till tha broke get more cash
Until then
Raise up

Blaze up
Lifes a mess dont stress

Does not mean we are not created equally

Or in the vast forest in which it breathes
I find greatness in the tree that grows against all odds
It blossoms in darkness and gives birth to promising pods
I was that tree that grew from the weeds and wasnt meant to be
Ashamed Im not in fact I am proud of my thriving family tree
The rose that grew from concrete yeah
The tree that wasnt meant to be
Though I struggle in my life I never give up
And you know that I will always be by your side
My family tree yeah a family tree
Yeah my family tree my family tree
I find greatness in the tree that grows against all odds
It blossoms in darkness and gives birth to a promising pod
Youll never see me give up
I will press on never hold my head alone
Never no my family tree my family tree yeah
My family tree family tree
Because we all spring from different trees
Does not mean we are not created equally
Is the true beauty in the tree
Or in the vast forest in which it breathes
The tree must fight to breathe
Among the evils of the weeds
I find greatness in the tree that grows against all odds
Ashamed Im not in fact I am proud of my thriving family treeUh oh uh oh oh Oh Oh

My after time is narrow peepin down the barrel of a foe
Just a nigga or a killer I dont know so
Who makes the call will I fall a victim like the rest
Slug in the chest one in the dome and make sure Im gone
Send me home all alone in these cold streets
In desperation constantly drinkin and I cant sleep
Neck deep strugglin tryin to survive
Some want to die I want to stay alive eyes on the prize
Let me modify this whole region
I declare this sucker duckin season give me the reason
Why I should change into a softie
after living so loftily
It cost me my soul out of control in a devils world

So you say that like that means somethin to me
Youve been gone a mighty long motherfuckin time
For you to be comin home talkin that daddys home shit
We been gettin along fine just without you
Me my brother and my mother
So if you dont mind you can step the fuck off pops fuck you
Had to play catch by myself what a sorry sight
A pitiful plight so I pray for a starry night
Please send me a pops before puberty
The things I would do to see a piece of family unity
Moms always work I barely see her
Im startin to get worried without a pops Ill grow to be her
Its a wonder they dont understand kids today
So when I pray I pray Ill never grow to be that way
And I hope that he answers me
I heard God dont like ugly well take a look at my family
A different father every weekend
Before we get to meet him they break up before the week ends
Im gettin sick of all the friendships
As soon as we kick it he done split and the whole shit ends quick
How can I be a man if theres no role model
Strivin to save my soul I stay cold drinkin a Forty bottle
Im so sorry
For all this time
For all this time
For all this time
Im so sorry
For all this time
For all this time
For all this time so sorry baby
Moms had to entertain many men
Didnt wanna do it but its time to pay the rent again
Im gettin a bit older and Im startin to be a bother
Moms cant stand me cause Im lookin like my father
Should I stay or run away tell me the answer
Moms ignores me and avoids me like cancer
Grow up rough and its hard to understand stuff
Moms was tough cause his poppa wasnt man enough
Couldnt stand up to his own responsibilities
Instead of takin care of me hed rather live lavishly
Thats why Ill never be a father
Unless you got the time its a crime dont even bother
Thats when I started hatin the phony smiles
Said I was an only child look at mamas lonely smile
Its hard for a son to see his mother cry
She only loves you but has to fuck with these other guys
Im so sorry
For all this time
For all this time
For all this time
Im so sorry
For all this time
For all this time
For all this time so sorry baby
Man child in the promised land couldnt afford many heroes
Moms was the only one there my pops was a no-show
And oh I guess ya didnt know that I would grow to be so strong
Lookin kinda pale was it the ale or pops was wrong
Where was the money that you said you would send me
Talked on the phone and you sounded so friendly
Ask about school and my welfare
But its clear you aint sincere and who the hell cares
You think Im blind but this time I see you comin Jack
You grabbed your coat left us broke now aint no runnin back
Ask about my moms like you loved her from the start
Left her in the dark she fell apart from a broken heart
So dont even start with that wanna be your father shit
Dont even bother with your dollars I dont need it
Ill bury moms like you left me all alone G
Now that I finally found you stay the fuck away from me
Im so sorry
For all this time
For all this time
For all this time
Im so sorry
For all this time
For all this time
For all this time so sorry baby
I never meant to leave but I was wanted
Crossed too many people every house Id touch was haunted
Had to watch the strangers every brother was in danger
If I was to keep you breathin had to be out of range
Had to move one to lost my name and pick the number
Made me watch my back I had no happy home to run to
Maybe its my fault for being a father livin fast
But livin slow mean half the dough why dont you get some ass
Hindsight shows me it was wrong all along
I wanted to make some dough so you would grow to be so strong
It took a little longer than I thought
I slipped got caught and sent to jail by the courts
Now Im doin time and I wish youll understand
All I ever wanted was for you to be a man
And grow to be the type you was meant to be
Keep the war fightin by the writings that you sent to me
Im so sorry
For all this time
For all this time
For all this time
Im so sorry
For all this time
For all this time
For all this time so sorry baby
Sorry
For all this time
For all this time
For all this time
I am sorry
For all this time
For all this time
For all this time so sorry baby
Sorry

Nickel bag full of sess weed laced with hash

Two childhood friends just died I couldnt cry

Arguments with my Boo is true

But everywhere its the same thing thats the game
Ill be damned if a thing changed fuck the fame

Aint no love for us ghetto children so we cold
Rag top slowing down time to stop for gas
Beep my horn for a hoochie with a proper ass
It aint easy thats my motto
Drinking Tanqueray straight out the bottle
Everybody wanna know if Im insane
My baby mama gotta mind full of silly games
And all the drama got me stressing like Im hopeless I cant cope
Me and the homies smoking roaches cause we broke
Late night hanging out til the sunrise getting high
Watching the cops roll by
It aint easy thats right
It aint easy being me
Will I see the penitentiary or will I stay free
It aint easy being me
Will I see the penitentiary or will I stay free
It aint easy being me
Will I see the penitentiary or will I stay free
I cant sleep niggas plotting on to kill me while Im dreaming
Wake up sweaty and screaming cause I can hear them suckers scheming
Probably paranoid problem is them punks be fantasizing
A brother bite the bullet open fire and I died
I wonder why this the way it is even now
Looking out for these killer kids cause they wild
Bill Clinton can you recognize a nigga representing
Doing twenty to life in San Quentin
Getting calls from my nigga Mike Tyson aint nothing nice

Lately been reminiscing
Bout Peppermint Schnapps in Junior High hit the block
Keep an eye on the cops while D-Boys slang rocks
Its the project kid without a conscience Im having dreams
Of hearing screams at my concerts me all my childhood peers
Through the years trying to stack a little green
I was only seventeen when I started serving fiends
And I wish there was another way to stack a dollar
So my apoli cause these hard times make me wanna holler
Will I live to see tomorrow am I falling off
I hit the weed and then proceed to say fuck all of yall
Aint nobody down with me Im thugging I cant go home
Cause muh-fuckers think Im bugging so now Im in
This high powered cell at the county jail
Punk judge got a grudge cant post no bail what
Do I do in these county blues
Getting battered and bruised by the you know who
And these fakes get to shaking when they face me
Snakes aint got enough nuts to replace me
Sitting in this living hell listening to niggas yell
Trying to torture em to tell Im getting mail
But aint nobody saying much the same old nuts
Is making bucks while these sluts is getting fucked
They violated my probation and it seems
Ill be going on a long vacation meanwhile
It aint easy
No it aint easy
It aint easy being me
Will I see the penitentiary or will I stay free
It aint easy being me
Will I see the penitentiary or will I stay freeLadies and gentlemen And gentlemen

Cause when we fuck I refuse to bust a nut until I beat it up
Drop the top time to fuck while the wind blow

And let me hit it where it counts and flee
Remember me I Get Around and Im haunted by my temptations

Instead of fakin like you cant hear the bed shakin
In bed naked you so twisted think yo legs breakin

Doggie style steady pumpin on that ass until I blast
And then I laugh as we lay back
See I wait til you asleep and thats the payback
Cause you actin like you did somethin givin me a piece

A true digger that love triggers a thug nigga
Hustlin bitches like drug dealers

Its said that every revolutionary act is a act of love
And this is an act of love
All power to the people
I said the P is for power the A for action
The N-T because now is the time to get it done
See the H is for heart and the E for effect
The R hold it down at the end for respect
Who am I A panther
Who am I A panther
What I got I got SOUL what I got I got LOVE
What I got I got PRIDE what I wanna be FREE
Raise your hands in the air if you feel like me
Mos Def w group emphasizing
Who am I A panther
Who am I A panther
What I got I got SOUL what I got I got LOVE
What I got I got PRIDE what I wanna be FREE
Raise your hands in the air if you feel like me
Mos Def
Can you see the pride of the panther
as he glows in splendor and grace
Topling obstacles placed
in the way of the progression of his race
Can you see the pride in the panther
as she nurtures her young all alone
The seed must grow regardless
of the fact that its planted in stone
Cant you see the pride of the panthers
as they unify as one
The flower blooms with brilliance
and outshines the rays of the sun
Outshines like the sun
Shines out like the sun
Shines bright like the sun
Brings light like the sun
Mos Def w group emphasizing
P is for power the A for action
The N-T because now is the time to get it done
See the H is for heart and the E for effect
The R hold it down at the end for respect
Who am I A panther

What I got I got SOUL what I got I got LOVE
What I got I got PRIDE what I wanna be FREE
Raise your hands in the air if you feel like me
Who am I A panther
Who am I A panther

What I got I got PRIDE what I wanna be FREE
Raise your hands in the air if you feel like me

And love love love is the engine to the revolutionYou are appreciated
When I was young me and my mama had beef
Seventeen years old kicked out on the streets
Though back at the time I never thought Id see her face
Aint a woman alive that could take my mamas place
Suspended from school and scared to go home I was a fool
With the big boys breaking all the rules
I shed tears with my baby sister
Over the years we was poorer than the other little kids
And even though we had different daddys the same drama
When things went wrong wed blame mama
I reminisce on the stress I caused it was hell
Hugging on my mama from a jail cell
And whod think in elementary
Hey I see the penitentiary one day
And running from the police thats right
Mama catch me put a whooping to my backside
And even as a crack fiend mama
You always was a black queen mama
I finally understand
For a woman it aint easy trying to raise a man
You always was committed
A poor single mother on welfare tell me how ya did it
Theres no way I can pay you back
But the plan is to show you that I understand
You are appreciated
Lady
Dont ya know we love ya Sweet lady
Dear mama
Place no one above ya sweet lady
You are appreciated
Dont ya know we love ya
Now aint nobody tell us it was fair
No love from my daddy cause the coward wasnt there
He passed away and I didnt cry cause my anger
Wouldnt let me feel for a stranger
They say Im wrong and Im heartless but all along
I was looking for a father he was gone
I hung around with the Thugs and even though they sold drugs
They showed a young brother love
I moved out and started really hanging
I needed money of my own so I started slanging
I aint guilty cause even though I sell rocks
It feels good putting money in your mailbox
I love paying rent when the rents due
I hope ya got the diamond necklace that I sent to you
Cause when I was low you was there for me
And never left me alone because you cared for me
And I could see you coming home after work late
Youre in the kitchen trying to fix us a hot plate
Ya just working with the scraps you was given
And mama made miracles every Thanksgiving
But now the road got rough youre alone
Youre trying to raise two bad kids on your own
And theres no way I can pay you back
But my plan is to show you that I understand
You are appreciated
Lady
Dont ya know we love ya Sweet lady
And dear mama
Place no one above ya sweet lady
You are appreciated
Dont ya know we love ya
Pour out some liquor and I reminisce cause through the drama
I can always depend on my mama
And when it seems that Im hopeless
You say the words that can get me back in focus
When I was sick as a little kid
To keep me happy theres no limit to the things you did
And all my childhood memories
Are full of all the sweet things you did for me
And even though I act crazy
I gotta thank the Lord that you made me
There are no words that can express how I feel
You never kept a secret always stayed real
And I appreciate how you raised me
And all the extra love that you gave me
I wish I could take the pain away
If you can make it through the night theres a brighter day
Everything will be alright if ya hold on
Its a struggle everyday gotta roll on
And theres no way I can pay you back
But my plan is to show you that I understand
You are appreciated
Lady
Dont ya know we love ya Sweet lady
And dear mama
Place no one above ya sweet lady
You are appreciated
Dont ya know we love ya
Sweet lady
And dear mama
Dear mama
Lady lady ladyHes braggin about his new Jordans
The baby just ran out of milk
Hes buyin gold every two weeks
The baby just ran out of Pampers
Hes buyin clothes for his new girl
and the baby just ran out of medicine
You ask for money for the baby
The daddy just ran out the door
Girl I cant believe him

If the old school didnt pave the way
What more could I say I wouldnt be here today
If the old school didnt pave the way
What more could I say I wouldnt be here today
If the old school didnt pave the way
What more could I say I wouldnt be here today
If the old school didnt pave the way
I remember Mr Magic Flash Grandmaster Caz
LL raising hell but that didnt last
Eric B Rakim was the shit to me
I flip to see a Doug E Fresh show with Ricky D
And Red Alert was puttin in work with Chuck Chill
Had my homies on the hill getting ill when shit was real
Went out to steal remember Raw with Daddy Kane
When De La Soul was puttin Potholes in the game
I cant explain how it was Whodini
Had me puffin on that buddha gettin buzzed cause there I was
Them block parties in the projects and on my block
You diggy dont stop sippin on that Private Stock
Through my speaker Queen Latifah and MC Lyte
Listen to Treach KRS to get me through the night
With T La Rock and Mantronix to Stetsasonic
Remember Push It was the bomb shit nuttin like the old school
What more could I say I wouldnt be here today
If the old school didnt pave the way
What more could I say I wouldnt be here today
If the old school didnt pave the way
What more could I say I wouldnt be here today
If the old school didnt pave the way
What more could I say I wouldnt be here today
If the old school didnt pave the way
What more could I say I wouldnt be here today
If the old school didnt pave the way
What more could I say I wouldnt be here today
If the old school didnt pave the way
I had Shell Toes and BVDs
A killer crease inside my Lees when I hit the streets
Im playing skelly ring to leavey or catch a kiss
Before the homies in my hood learned to smack a bitch I remember
Way back the weak weed they had
Too many seeds in the trey bag
Im on the train headin uptown freestyling
With some wild kids from Bucktown profiling
Cause the hoochies was starin thinking Why them niggas swearing
Im wondering if thats her hair I remember
Stickball pump the hoochies on the wall
Or taking leaks on the steps stinking up the hall
Through my childhood wild as a juvenile
A young nigga tryin to stay away from Rikers Isle
Me and my homies breakin nights tryin to keep it true
Out on the roof sipping ninety proof aint nuttin like the old school
What more could I say I wouldnt be here today
If the old school didnt pave the way
What more could I say I wouldnt be here today
If the old school didnt pave the way
What more could I say I wouldnt be here today
If the old school didnt pave the way
What more could I say I wouldnt be here today
If the old school didnt pave the way
What more could I say I wouldnt be here today
If the old school didnt pave the way
What more could I say I wouldnt be here today
If the old school didnt pave the way
Remember popping and locking to Kurtis Blow the name belts
And Scott LaRock the Super Ho back in Latin Quarters
When Slick Rick was spittin La-Di-Da-Di
Gaming the hoochies at the neighborhood block parties I remember
Breakdancing to Melle Mel
Jekyll and Hyde LL when he Rocks the Bells
Forget the TV about to hit the streets and do graffiti
Be careful dont let the transit cops see me
It aint nothing like the old school
What more could I say I wouldnt be here today
If the old school didnt pave the way
What more could I say I wouldnt be here today
If the old school didnt pave the way
What more could I say I wouldnt be here today
If the old school didnt pave the way
What more could I say I wouldnt be here today
If the old school didnt pave the way
What more could I say I wouldnt be here today
If the old school didnt pave the way
What more could I say I wouldnt be here today
If the old school didnt pave the wayGet money nigga yeah aw yeah
Dedicate this one to all the hustlers
That get up every motherfuckin morning
And put they work down
I see you I see you boy
Im up before sunrise first to hit the block
Lil bad motherfucka with a pocket full of rocks
Learned to throw them thangs
Get my skinny lil ass kicked
Niggas laughed till the first motherfucka got blasted
I put the nigga in his casket
And now they covering the basket with plastic
I smoke blunts on the regular fuck peelin caps
Tryin to make a million dollars out a quarter ounce
Gettin chased by the five O fuck them hoes
Gotta forty-five screamin out survival
Hey nigga can I lay low
Cook some ya-yo and holla five O when I say so
Dont want to go to the pen
Im hittin fences
Cops on a nigga back missin me by inches
And they say how do you survive
Weighing one hundred and fifty-five in the city where the little niggas die
Tell mama dont cry cause even if they kill me
They can never take the life of a real G
Im gettin money
Im gettin money
Im gettin money
Im gettin money
Still on parole and Im the first nigga
Servin postin liquor on the curb
For my homies that deserve it
If I want to make a million
Gotta stay ill and kinda cool around the way
I think today I make a killing
Dressed down like Im dirty
But only on the block just a clever disguise
To keep ya runnin from the cops
Gettin high I think I die if I dont get no ends
In a bucket but Im ridin it like its a Benz
I hit the strip I let my music buck
Drinking liquor and Im looking for a bitch to fuck
Rather die making money than live poor and legal
As I slang another ounce I wish it was a kilo
I need money in a major way
Try to fuck my girl she gettin paid today
I live thug life and let the money come to me
Cause they can never take the game from a young G
Im gettin money
Im gettin money
Im gettin money
Im gettin money
Damned if I dont and damned if a nigga do
Now watch a young motherfucka pull a trigger too
Craze out and dont let them see ya cry
Dry ya eyes young nigga time to Do or Die
I pack a pistol in my pocket
Ready on my Glock
Aint no time for a nigga to even cock shit
I done seen a motherfucka peep pain
At point blank range cause he slept on the game
Aint a damn thing changed
They checking the time
Snap rolling if you cant stand playin betta hoe
Cause aint no telling what ya might roll
You might fold catch AIDS from a slight cold
You better live ya life to the fullest
Be quick to kill a bull got a pistol
Motherfucka better pull it
And even if they kill me they can never take the life of a young G
Im gettin money
Im gettin money
Im gettin money
Im gettin moneyAh shit ha ha ha
When I enter the first zone
Worst known mic holder
My Hummer roll up
Evacuating strapped soldiers
Inside strategy
Manifestin military styles
Casually try da G
When niggas battle me
My prophesied prediction
Switch and move positions
Separated from his gun and bitch
And watch em start snitchin
I keep spittin still stupid niggas fail to listen
I personify this thug livin
Hell or prison
My ammunition varies
My voice carries
Watch me invite the whole world
Me and the mob gettin married
It seems all the fine screams pierce the dark
This is expected
A trick bitch where is your heart
You mark
Watch niggas fall when I call they name
We outlaws hold your head niggas all the same
Except some who want more out of life than stress
We still thuggin til its none left
Dont sleep

Keep my pistol on my side
Always creep wit the nine when I ride when I ride

Always hustlin on the grind

Dumpin on motherfuckers at random
Rapidly
Wit accuracy
They shouldnt talk bad to me
It had to be
A motherfuckin murder
Im glad to be
A nigga that did the murder
So sad to see
Another motherfucker floatin
In plastic reef
Sleep wit his head wide open head smokin
Rapid release
Keep the police coastin
Casualties
Warrant in deep east Oakland doors wide open
Yolk the nigga off the asphalt
Drove off to the hills
Positioned him on his knees and blew the back off
Death with the lex ruger
Death to ya
Niggas cry when the bullets fly
Kill and execute em
I blast first til they body me
Like my guns in variety
Runnin wit the real big willies you silly punks try to be
But front
Doin my walk bys rollin a blunt
Hand on my nuts in a getaway car full of stunts
Addicted to my nine
Movin like crime through time
Poppin niggas like pimples
Nigga nothin simple bout mine
Etch-a-sketchin
Dumpin on all you punks at intersections
Day in and day out
Aint no easy way outs or easy exits
Dont sleep

Gs up
A-Town
When I hit the street
All I can see is the grind
Blood sweat and tears when I bust my rhyme
Yeah I un- for my folk like I load my nine
And when I let loose
Then no crew standin but mine
I gives a damn bout lame nigga actin schiesty
Same one knew I was in jail and didnt write me
Wanna fight me then come find me
What eva you do shawty you betta think wisely
You might see me wit a stack in the trap Aye
I use my thoughts and pen
Similar to a saran wrap
A lil lame nigga Ill neva be

Dont sleep
Blowin pine
Always hustlin on the grind
Cause I gotta get mine all the time all the time
Dont sleep
Dont Sleep
Dont sleepThe only way to change me is maybe blow my brains out
Stuck in the middle of the game to get the pain out
Pray to my God everyday but he dont listen
The poverty bothers me but mamas working wonders in the kitchen
Listen I can hear her crying in the bedroom
Praying for money we never think would she be dead soon
Am I wrong for wishing I was somewhere else
At thirteen cant feed myself
Can I blame daddy cause he left me
Wish he wouldve helped me
Too much like him til my mama dont love me
On my own at a early age gettin paid
And Im strapped so Ill never be afraid
Where did I go astray Im hanging in the back streets
Running with Gs and dope fiends will they jack me
Cant turn back my eyes on the prize
I got nothing to lose
Everybody gotta die
Say good-bye to the bad guy
That one you fucked when you passed by
Buck buck from a Glock
Tempered glass fly
Do or Die walk a mile in my shoes
And youd be crazy too
With nothing to lose
I got nothing to lose Thats why I got gang related
Got nothing to lose
Nothing to lose
I thank the Lord for my many blessings
Though Im stressin keep a vest for protection
From the barrel of the Smith Wesson
And all my niggas in the pen
Here we go again
Aint nothing separating us from a mack ten
Born in the ghetto as a hustla older
Straight soldier bucking at them bustas
No matter how you try niggas never die
We just retaliate with hate then we multiply
See me striking down the block hittin coners
Mobbin like a motherfucka livin like I want to
Aint no stoppin at the red lights Im sideways
Thug Life muthafucka crime pays
Let the cops put they lights on
Chase me niggas
Zig-zaggin through the freeway
Race me nigga
In a high speed chase with the law
The realest muthafucka that you ever saw
Im livin raw til they bury me dont worry me
Im high livin like I aint afraid to die
And you could walk a mile in my shoes
And youd be crazy too
I got nothing to lose Thats why I got gang related
Got nothing to lose
Nothing to lose
Aint no escape from a deadly fate
And everyday theres a million black bodies put away
Im startin to lose hope
It seems everybodys on dope
Mama told me to leave cause she was broke
Sometimes I choke on the indo
Peepin out the window alone on my own
Im a criminal
Got no love from the household Im out cold
In the streets give me motherfuckin peace
I got nothing to lose
And something to prove
What do I do live Thug Life nigga stay true
I wonder when they kill me
Is there a Heaven for a real G
Lord forgive me if you feel me
Cause all my life I was dirt broke
With no hope lil skinny muthafucka wantin dough
I hated cutting suckers with my razor blade
But everyday its a struggle to get major paid
Anyway its so hard on a nigga in this city
No pity and aint no love for the scrubs that be buyin time
If you could walk a mile in my shoes youd be crazy too
With nothing to lose
I got nothing to lose Thats why I got gang related
Got nothing to lose
Nothing to lose
It was a what type nigga be a Thug Life nigga
We be the craziest motherfucka
You know
It was a what type nigga be a Thug Life nigga
We be the craziestDamnanother funeralanother mothafucken funeral

Number oneFrom the cradle to the grave
Life aint never been easy livin in the ghetto
From the cradle to the grave
Life aint never been easy
June sixteenth one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-one
Mama gave birth to a hell-raisin heavenly son
See the doctor tried to smack me but I smacked him back
My first words was Thug for life and Papa pass the Mac
Im bustin on these motherfuckers ballin
Listen you can hear my mini fourteen callin
From out the window of my drop top I got my Glock cocked
Bustin at niggas when will it stop
Now tell me are you scared of the dark
Cant close my eyes I see visions
And even with this thug livin will I escape prison
Penitentiary chances was an all day thang
The only way to advance and if you slang
Then youd better have yo Nikes on - cause when we fight
Its in the middle of the night with no lights on hey
There must be a God cause I feel lucky
Paranoid out my mind cause motherfuckers tryin to rush me
Am I goin to jail Look at me bailin
Comin out the court house all about my mail and bank
Never never die Ill be a hustler motherfuckers
And makin thugs out you suckers from the cradle to the grave
From the cradle to the grave
Life aint never been easy livin in the ghetto
From the cradle to the grave since a little bitty child
Ive been known to get ill and kinda buck wild
Pop pop Just like the part thats in my walk with street talk
Im runnin up the block in the dark where lead spark
Surveillance on a nigga every day
Waitin on my daddy just to take his ass away
Now Mama always workin tryin to make ends meet
So now a young niggas bein raised by the streets
And then the only other one that ever showed me love
Was my dope fiend uncle strung out on drugs
A straight - thug just me my mama out here on our own
So I got two gats - one black and one of chrome
Now I dont wanna hurt nobody but I must defend mine
Its all the fuck I got so stop and walk a thin line
Young niggas be brave
And keep on thuggin from the cradle to the grave
From the cradle to the grave
From the cradle to the grave
Life aint never been easy livin in the ghetto
From the cradle to the grave
Im glad to say I made it this far
Many Gs died hogs and all they got was they name hit up on a wall
Its sad thinkin about the times
Life goes on Im steady lost in this land
Thats the war zone I gots no home dont have no friends neither
Its just me by my lonely so I married my nina
I keeps her wherever I go I love my ho
Never leave home with out my sugar Im hafta plug a nigga
Mama told me not to trust no punks
And kick his ass if he lay a hand on me since then I been knowin
Sometimes I think my own self stupid
Cause I stay shootin at marks get twisted up in police reports
Since the cradle Ive been ungrateful
My first toy was a gun I got sprung and learned to love weapons
But now Im through with money and through with street fame
Somebody peeled my cap and put me in my grave
From the cradle to the grave
Life aint never been easy livin in the ghetto
From the cradle to the grave
Life aint never been easy livin in the ghetto
March eighteenth a rainy day my mama gave birth
To a baby boy trapped in hell on Earth
From day one it wasnt fun I never had a crumb
Daddy worked two jobs and Mama wont stop drinkin rum
I tried to cope loc but my familys broke
And my pockets short so now I got ta slang dope
In the game filled with pain its a fuckin shame
The white man got a motherfucker slangin caine
So now its on from dusk to dawn Im gettin my serve on
Always in the spot with my Glock slingin rocks at the Rox
The shit dont stop Im steady dodgin cops
I never flip-flop hear my Glock cock thug til I drop
And if I hit the pen I gotta do my time
Sittin on my bunk reminiscin bout the good times
Its fucked up a nigga gotta grow up doin dirt
But from the cradle to the grave Ima put in work
From the cradle to the grave
Life aint never been easy livin in the ghetto
From the cradle to the grave
Life aint never been easy livin in the ghetto
Times movin fast will I last another day
So I pray and I lay with my A-K
Did I sell my soul as a young kid
All the things I did wishin someone held me but they never did
I cant take it will I make it to my older age
Before Im shot up or locked up in a fuckin cage
Lord help me guide me save me
Cause thats the way that Daddy raised me crazy
Do or die nigga pull the trigger dont give a fuck
Youd rather be in jail than get yo ass bucked
Nobody cares its me against the world
Keepin murder on my mind and my tec-nine
I got nothin to lose payin dues nigga you wanna die
I get high and then my mission is a walk-by
Youd better jet when I hit your set cause Im comin
Start runnin yellin evil mind as Im gunnin
One in the chamber for the anger that I build inside
For the mothers that cried for my homies that died
The beginning is an ending am I just a slave
So I got to be brave from the cradle to the grave
From the cradle to the grave
Life aint never been easy livin in the ghetto
From the cradle to the grave
Life aint never been easy livin in the ghettoMakaveli Im in the studio drunk then a muthafa
Ready to freestyle this s and do it wild
Live for all my dogs For all my dogs out there raising hell
Just to see ya young n raise the bail
Stepped out on the streets fresh from jail
All the police want to rag and tell
Not knowing that I stacks my mail
All these ns want to see me fail
Thats just the intro as I sit back and rock this instrumental
After the fire comes the rain after the pleasure its pain
Even though we broke for the moment we ballin the game
Time to make yo mind military be prepared for the bustas
Similar to bes too scary and too near me be rushing
Visions of over-packed prisons
Feens and ns thug livin
Pressures and three Strikes hope they dont tell us
They call it heater amminition at grace
Move without a sound let me slide down pistols in place
They got me feenin for currency the money it goes
Its like Im a dreamin senior season me ballin
Official hated and my enemies be hated got the cops four-five stanchin ns pagers
Laid with a mark soon as we start but its hard to quit
Started out drinkin fortys the hardest s
God Damn now Im a grown man I follow no man

Young Noble bring the soul to the troop let em know we come through in a bucket of BMWs

We never hide we ride and die together
And when you see my click we always ride forever

That they can come against me
You cant see me on TV or live ns die when they try to come against me
Never hide in my own zone in my own dome

Came from India Felizimo was the call yeah n I got Vasache on
On mighty all them ns want to f with me whyall know
I always represent my people to the fullest
Yeah Im that same muthafa that took five bulletsStraight outta Oakland California where we spark it on ya
Give a shout out to my partners in the darkest corners
I remember drinkin Hennesey smokin weed
Fantasize about the things wed grow to be
Had a partner named Snoop loved to clown a stank
Smoke a pound a day commenced to down a drank
Shooting craps in the alley til they chased us off
Pour a little for my homies but dont waste it all
Ooh wee who popped that coochie best
On my tattooed chest is where the hoochies rest
Having house parties in a crowded spot
And you can tell its hot they talk loud a lot
Everybody wanna dance when the slow jam come
lookin dumb cause you waitin for your chance to hump
Straight grindin everybody havin fun
And its cool til a fool pull a loaded gun
Cause another dude kicked his Bacardi over
He had to act a fool now the partys over
Gun shots rang like its thunder
And everybody bum rushing and Im rushing to get a number
Says she got a man but shes lying
Why I seen her talking to this other guy and
Hes a dealer so you know she gonna sweat him
I aint trippin I just hope he get em I got nothin but love
Aint got nothin but love for ya
Im down for yours nothin but love
Aint got nothin but love for ya
Im down for yours nothin but love
Aint got nothin but love for ya
Im down for yours nothin but love
Aint got nothin but love for ya
Im down for yours nothin but love
I love to go back to the block I got my game from
And pay respect to the place that I came from
Cause uh old man still drinkin his breath still stinkin
Hed love to tell ya what hes thinkin
But I cant diss him hes my elder
He been livin here longer what that tell ya
And little girls playin double dutch
Still blush cause she dont get in trouble much
Its uh ponytails and barrettes
I gotta make it back home before the sun decides to set
And little boys playin stick ball quick yall
Get out the street before they hit yall
And as I reminisce I think about my ghetto bliss
And wonder how we came to this
I help an old lady across the street the cost is free
I cant take what she offers me
And this is how the world could be
This is how the world should be
Feels good to be back on the streets
Cause I know they got love for me nothin but love
Aint got nothin but love for ya
Im down for yours nothin but love
When I was young I used to want to be a dealer see
Cause the gold and cars they appealed to me
I saw our brothers getting rich slangin crack to folks
And the squares getting big for these sack of dope
Started thinking bout a plan to get paid myself
So I made myself raised myself
Til the dealer on the block told me That aint cool
You aint meant to slang crack you a rapper fool
I got my game about women from a prostitute
And way back used to rap on the block for loot
I tried to make my way legit ha ha
But it was hard cause rhymes dont pay the rent
And uh it was funny how I copped out
I couldnt make it in school so finally I dropped out
My family on welfare
Im steady thinking since dont nobody else care
Im out here on my own
At least in jail I have a meal and I wouldnt be alone
Im feelin like a waste tears rollin down my face
Cause my life is filled with hate
Until I looked around me
I saw nothing but family straight up down for me
Panthers Pimps Pushers and Thugs
Hey yo thats my family tree I got nothin but love
Aint got nothin but love for ya
Im down for yours nothin but love
Aint got nothin but love for ya
Aint got nothin but love for ya
Aint got nothin but love for ya
Aint got nothin but love for yaPac in a slurred drunken voice
Ha ha ha fuck all yall fuck all yall I dont need nobody

When all these motherfuckin cops be on me
I got problems aint nobody calling back
Now what the fuck is happenin with my ballin cats
Remember me Im ya homie that was down to brawl
Sippin Hennessy hanging with the clowns and
All we used to do is drink brew screw and common knew
We had bitches by the dozens huh we fuckin cousins
You can throw ya middle finger if ya feel me loc
A nigga just got paid and we still was broke
It took time but finally the cash was mine
All the rewards of a hustler stuck in the grind
Look around and all I see is snakes and fakes
Its like scavengers waitin to take a hustlers place
And if you stuck where the fuck is all ya friends
They straight busted and cant be trusted fuck yall
Fuck all yall fuck all yall
Im sippin Tanqueray and juice and whats the use
Cause Im a hopeless thug
Aint no love reminiscing on how close we was
Way back in the day before they put the crack in the way
And hey how much money can you stack in a day
Its gettin rough collect calls from my niggas in cuffs
I recollect we used to ball now just livings enough
I stand tall in the winter summer spring or fall
Thug for life sprawled all across the wall
And all about my dollars make me wanna holla
Drop an album sell a million give a fuck about tomorrow
I know its gettin crazy after dark
These marks keep on huffin and puffin
Aint no fear in my heart
Whats going on in the ghetto still struggle and strive
I still roll with the heater smokin chocolate Thai
In ninety-four Ill be going solo
Too many problems of my own so Im rollin dolo
Fuck all yall
Fuck all yall fuck all yall
Fuck all yall fuck all yall
Fuck all yall fuck all yall
I went from rags to riches
Quick to socializing with the baddest bitches
Went from a bucket to a rag with switches
Im seein death around the corner
Im bumpin Gloria doin ninety cause I wanna
Im getting high and like I said it was some chocolate Thai
Mixed with some indonesia watch me fly
And even though I know the cops behind me
Hit the weed and uh I continue doing ninety Biotch
Until I get caught another ticket get to kick it in court

I know they wanna see a nigga buried
But I aint worried still throwing these thangs
Got me locked in these chains
And hey nigga what the fuck is you wailin bout

And when I hit the streets Im in a rush to ball
Im screaming Thug Life nigga fuck yall
Ha ha ha fuck all yall fuck all yall I dont need nobody
Fuck em fuck all yallSarah Jones
Why must you be unfaithful For women
Men you shouldnt listen to your selfish heart
It doesnt really have a brain
Besides keepin you alive its existence is in vain
And how could I be so mean and say your heart has no place
Because mortal men fall in love again
as fast as they change their face
I may be cruel but think awhile about the hearts that you have broken
and match that with the empty vows and broken promises youve spoken
Now Im not saying females are perfect
cause we know its not true
But why must you be unfaithful
if her heart is true to youOutlaw Immortalz
Bow down to somethin greater than yourself trick
Individuals capable of enormous amounts of chin checks and eye swolls
They know
You watchin but you aint seein what lies before you biatch
Picture if you will seven deadly human beings blessed with the gift of speech
The power to reach
Each nigga on every street
May the heavenly father look down and be proud of what transpired
Since the day the seed was planted
The G grew but we knew hed rise up quick
Smoked out loced out all into shit
Just me and my dogs livin like hogs
Outlaw Immortalz

Rap-related criminally activated and evil

You see what I got to make you freeze to touch me you need ten of these
Complete most wanted on the streets of the East coast
Young Gunz fire and niggas bleed I see Mo

Million billion dollar baller potential

But it aint nothin and I got no time for no bluffin
Befo a nigga finish with puttin in work I betta end up with somethin

Cause my mama say Im good for nothin so Im out
Since I only got one life to live God forgive me for my sins

Want to let you know I love you
Love you if you didnt know I feel this way

And you can never understand til we trade places
Tell the world I feel guilty to bein anxious
Aint no way in hell that I could ever be rapist
Its hard to face this cold world on a good day
When will they let the little kids in the hood play
I got shot five times but Im still breathin
Livin proof theres a God if you need a reason
Can I believe in my own fate
Will I raise my kids in the right or the wrong way
Dear mama Im a man now
I want to make it on my own not a handout
Make way for a whirlwind prophesied
I want to go in peace when I gotta die
On these cold streets aint no love no mercy and no friends
In case you never see my face again
To my unborn child
Im writing you a letter
This is to my unborn child
Want to let you know I love you
Love you if you didnt know I feel this way
How I think about you every day
I have so much to say
Dear Lord can you hear me tell me what to say
To my unborn seed in case I pa away
Will my child get to feel love
Or are we all just cursed to be street thugs Cause bein black hurts
And even worse if you speak first
Livin my life as an Outlaw what could be worse
Cause maybe if I tried to change

Touch bases eat lunch at plush places
Regular criminal oasis awaits us
If theres a ghetto for true thugs Ill see you there

My AK told me to shove him up some niggas ass
Im having long conversations with Mr Millometer

And Miss Mossburg love it in the back trunk

And splitting motherfuckers by the seams

Heavenly Father hear a nigga down here
Before I go to sleep
Tell me who do you believe in
Who do you believe in
I see mothers in black cryin brothers in packs dyin
Plus everybodys high too doped up to ask why
Watchin our own downfall witness the end
Its like we dont believe in God cause we livin in sin
I asked my homie on the block why he strapped he laughed
Pointed his pistol as the cop car passed and blast
Its just another murder nobody mourns no more
My tear drops gettin bigger but cant figure what Im cryin for
Is it the miniature caskets little babies
Victims of a stray from drug dealers gone crazy
Maybe its just the drugs visions of how the block was
Crack came and it was strange how it rocked us
Perhaps the underlyin fact stay high explain genocide
Its when we ride on our own kind
What is it we all fear reflections in the mirror
We cant escape fate the end is gettin nearer
Who do you believe in
I put my faith in God blessed and still breathin
And even though its hard thats who I believe in
Before Im leavin Im askin the grievin
Who do you believe in
Who do you believe in
I put my faith in God blessed and still breathin
And even though its hard thats who I believe in
Before Im leavin Im askin the grievin
Who do you believe in
Cant close my eyes cause all I see is terror
I hate the man in the mirror
Cause his reflection makes the pain turn realer
Times of Armageddon murder in mass amounts
In this society where only gettin the cash counts
I started out as a beginner
Entered the criminal lifestyle became a sinner
I make my money and vacate evade prison
Went from the chosen one to outcast unforgiven
And all the Hennessey and weed cant hide the pain I feel inside
You know its like Im livin just to die
I fall on my knees and beg for mercy not knowin if Im worthy
Livin life thinkin no man can hurt me
So Im askin before I lay me down to sleep
Before you judge me look at all the shit you did to me my misery
I rose up from the slums made it out the flames
In my search for fame will I change Im askin
Who do you believe in
I put my faith in God blessed and still breathin
And even though its hard thats who I believe in
Before Im leavin Im askin the grievin
Who do you believe in
Who do you believe in
I put my faith in God blessed and still breathin
And even though its hard thats who I believe in
Before Im leavin Im askin the grievin
Who do you believe in
Faith in Allah believe in me and this plastic
Cause so far I done witnessed to many dead niggas in caskets
With they chest plates stretched like elastic
And whats worse Im on front line holdin down camp still mashin
Heard my cousin one of the old heads from the block
Just came home October of ninety-five back in Yardsville stuck
with a three to five if he dont act up now he realize
If you dont stay wise then in this game you fucked
Talk to my baby girl give me the word on what she heard
One of the grimmies is snitchin Diamond a stool pigeon I talked to him
He said he didnt my man said he did in fact hes sure
Cause he just came home off of bail
Now tell me
Who do you believe in
I put my faith in God blessed and still breathin
And even though its hard thats who I believe in
Before Im leavin Im askin the grievin
Who do you believe in
Who do you believe in
I put my faith in God blessed and still breathin
And even though its hard thats who I believe in
Before Im leavin Im askin the grievin
Who do you believe in
Who do you believe in
Is it Buddha Jehovah or Jah Or Allah
Is it Jesus Is it God Or is just yourself
definitely not to be imposed being a demon
Because this is the joy of believing
Men to believe in yourselves
But for sure the higher power
Resides only to ride in the heart of the true
From the soul of the man for truth never has an alibi
In the poetry or in its realm
Thats what pulls all words together
Just to understand that every man is his own man
And only man can satisfy the man
Only the soul of the man the feelings of the man
The for realness of the man
You cant shake the man when you feel the man you know the man
And you gotta call yourself because you are that man
Who do you believe in
I put my faith in God blessed and still breathin
Blessed and still breathin even though its hard
Who do you believe in Who do you believe in
I put my faith in Godbefore Im leavin even though its hard
Im askin Before Im leavin Im askin the grievin
Who do you believe in

Cause once you look at it
You know Really do
They dont give a fuck about us
They dont give a fuck about us
They dont give a fuck about us
If I choose to ride thuggin til the day I die
Nobody gives a fuck about us
And when I start to rise
A hero in their childrens eyes
Now they give a fuck about us
Some say niggas is hard headed cause we love to trick
Equipped with game so we bang with this thuggish shit
I see you tryin to hide hopin that nobody dont notice
You must always remember
Youre still a member of the hopeless
See youre black like me so you snap like me
When these devils try to plot trap our young black seeds
Look it cops are just as crooked as the niggas they chasin
Lookin for role models our father figures is basers
Some say they expect Illuminati take my body to sleep
Niggas at the party with they shotties just as rowdy as me
Before I fear computer chips I gotta deal with brothers flippin
I dont see no devils bleedin only black blood drippin
We can change what your mouth say
Im watchin niggas work their lives out without pay
Whatever it takes to switch places with the busters on top
Im bustin shots make the world stop
They dont give a fuck about us
Now if I choose to ride thuggin til the day I die
Nobody gives a fuck about us
But when I start to rise
A hero in their childrens eyes
Now they give a fuck about us
If I choose to ride thuggin til the day I die
Nobody gives a fuck about us
But when I start to rise
A hero in their childrens eyes
Now they give a fuck about us
Its the morning after and now all the laughter is gone
Time to reflect on what you did cause they saying you wrong
Im sure you had your reasons dawg I dont doubt you
See the simple fact of the matter is they dont give a fuck about you
Or them five mouths you forced to feed Uh-huh
Not including yourself all you want is wealth they perceive it as greed
So as you loaded up that MAC and continue to bust
I was on paper thinkin they dont give a fuck about us
Im seein it clearer hatin the picture in the mirror
They claim we inferior so why the fuck these devils fear ya
Im watchin my nation die genocide the cause
Expect a blood bath the aftermath is yalls
I told you last album we need help cause we dyin
Give us a chance help us advance cause we tryin
Ignore my whole plea watchin us in disgust
And then they beg when my guns bust
They dont give a fuck about us
Now if I choose to ride thuggin til the day I die
Nobody gives a fuck about us
But when I start to rise
A hero in their childrens eyes
Now they give a fuck about us
If I choose to ride thuggin til the day I die
Nobody gives a fuck about us
But when I start to rise
A hero in their childrens eyes
Now they give a fuck about us
Now all my homies got love for me
Down to catch a slug for me
Guaranteed to bleed deeply now thats love
Shit nobody else could give a fuck
If Im tore down from the floor down six-feet deep in the cut
What the fuck done went wrong
How long will I be mourned
When Im gone same song aint gave a fuck all along
And who am I to blame em
Just do or die through the rainin
Since they dont give a fuck I dont feel what Im sayin
Now thug niggas die but multiply in doubles
Wrapped in plastic or closed casket for our troubles
Pressed in times we busted like bubbles
With the police this nations peace sent here to run you
Now look at what this crooked world has come to
I grew up on the other side of perfect a life of hurtin
Master a hustle soon dyin certain
So I spent your time in poor and workin I see no reason
So I stay ballin season to season
Why you stuck thinkin that they give a fuck
You tell me my world is in peace but nigga youre lyin
Cause half of my niggas long gone
Buried in the dirt just for tryin
Sometimes I think my block is dyin and that is awful
To wake up to another day shit aint changed thats all fool
I wake up sweatin dreamin coughin
Seein me upside down backwards head twisted
While Im layin in the coffin
The shit comes around so often so tell me somethin
Before I take it out on the world and get to dumpin
Nigga I be so in vain go through the struggle
And Im doin the same thing you did at my age and thats hustlin
On the edge of straight bustin
Well since you dont give a fuck I be frontin
Imma drink my Hennessy like it aint nothin
Now if I choose to ride thuggin til the day I die
They dont gives a fuck about us
But while Im kickin rhymes
Kick it to their childrens minds

Nothing more I despise than a liar
Cowards die
My mama told me when I was a seed
Just a vicious motherfucker while these devils left me free
I proceed to make them shiver when I deliver
Criminal lyrics from a world wide mob figure
Thug niggas from everywhere Mr Makaveli
Niggas is waiting for some thug shit thats what they tell me
So many rumors but Im infinite Immortal Outlaw
Switching up on you ordinary bitches like a southpaw you get left
And every breath I breathe until the moment Im deceased
Will be another moment ballin as a G
I rip the crowd then I start again
Eternally I live in sin until the moment that they let me breathe again
The hearts of men
The hearts of men
My lyrical verse was so much pain to some niggas it hurts
My guns bust and if you aint one of us it gets worse
Bitch niggas get their eyes swoll
In fly mode Im a homicidal outlaw
And five-zero get your lights on the fights on
Tonights gonna be a fucking fight so we might roll
My own homies say Im heartless
But Im a G to this until the day Im gone thats regardless
Ride by niggas bow down
Thought Id rot in jail paid bail well niggas out now
Throw up your hands if you thugged out
First nigga act up
First nigga getting drugged out
I can be a villian if ya let me
A motherfucker if you do upset me
Tell the cops to come and get me
Rip the crowd like a phone number
Then start again dont have no mutherfuckin friends nigga
Look inside the hearts of men
In the hearts of men
In the hearts of men
To all my niggas engaged in making money in the fifty states
Keep your mind on your chips and fuck a punk bitch
No longer living in fear my pistol close in hand
Convinced this is my year like Im the chosen man
Give me my money and label me as a don
If niggas is having problems smoke em fire and bomb
I died and came back
I hustle with these lyrics as if its a game of crack
Thugging is in my spirit
Im lost and not knowing
Scard up but still flowing
Energized and still going
Uh can it be fate
That makes a sick motherfucker break
On these jealous ass coward cause they evil and fake
What will it take
Give me that bass line Im feeling bomb
Death Row baby dont be alarmed
The homie Quik gave a nigga a beat and let me start again
Represent cause Ive been sent
The hearts of menAgainst all odds Im still here nigga
Aiyyy I got to get my props for twoPacalypse

And the more you try to keep niggaz away from me
The more I unite with mo niggaz and mo niggaz and mo niggaz
Extra special thanks to my nigga Big John Major
And its a ghetto in every city and a nigga in every ghetto
I owe him thanks to my man Mike Cooley and the rest of out fathers
Motherfucker we are unstoppable
And uhh Im not goin aliveIn the life we live as thugs
Everbody fuckin wit us so cant you see
Its hard to be a man
Ridin wit my gun in hand
Why explain the game Niggas aint listenin
Stuck in positions If victims cant stand the heat
Then stay the fuck out the kitchen
Have these bustas switchin lookin at me mean
Itchin givin suckas plenty space
Have these bitch niggas snitchin
Where are we now Guns found daily
The feds surely hope that they could finally nail me for sellin dope
They backwards make tracks burst whenever I rap
Attack Words bein known to explode on contact
Extreme at times Blinded by my passion and fury
Look at me laugh at my competitions flashin my jewelry
Youd stay silent if you niggas knew me Truely effective
The shit you heard aint do me justice Got a death wish bitch
Run up face me and trace wit an infared beam
It seems niggas aint recognize my team
Aint nobody holdin you back Explode the track to confetti
Unload it cause niggas aint ready The life of an outlaw
Code three Attack formation Pull out your pistols
Keep an eye out for the devils cause they itchin to get you
Mercy to this madman screamin kamikaze in tongue
Automatic gunfire makin all my enemies run
Who should I call when Im shot and bleedin
Indeed the possibility has part a chase in cream
Dope got me hatin fiends Scheam wit my team just a chosen few
My foes victim of explosives Come closer Exhale the fumes
We got memories fadin fast A slave for cash
Accelerate mash blast then dash
Dont look now How you like it raw
Niggas aint ready for the wrath of the outlaws Never surrender
Death is for a son to stay free Im thugged out
Fuck the world cause this is how they made me
Scarred but still breathin
Believe in me and you could see the victory
A warrior with jewels Can you picture me
Life of and outlaw
City under siege Its like I cant even breathe
Im from the state of car theives G deep from the street
Plenty beef I play for keeps arrange the whole crime scene
Mobb Deep This nigga from behind tryin to creep
No halfs wit no straps jack
Its on to bounce back
And an ounce so fat they snatch my style
Get this grip wit hollows to get cha
Snip wit clippers Get the picture
I wrote my life down like a scripture
And Im still on lost in the land of the lonely
Where aint nobody holy A matter of a fact we unholy
Everybody livin soley for themselves Too hostile on a land hell
Somebody need me You know we lost hope and we needin it
Wit the evil its forever But it might be low down scandalouz
Like a tramp is All for the street fame on how to be managed
To plan shit six months in advaced to what we plotted
Approved to go on swole and now I got it
Un uh crack my window Knowin theyd love to catch Kastro sleepin
Attach a strap under my pillow and a hand like we freakin
Creepin deep into morning Peepin out the weak
While they yawnin and let my cloud speak for its self
No doubt Outlaw Outta my mind outta time Youre all blind
Some kind of life of mine Kato dont mind
Findin it funny matter of fact cause it is
Perhaps finally I look at that true over the years as an outlaw
Eh Noble
Whats up nigga
Would you die for me nigga
Hell yeah
Would you kill for me
On my grandmother nigga
Ah yo
Whats up
Lets ride on them stupid bitches right now
Watch out
Well now they all say they roaches and parasites
Snakes and all they might
Thug Life break night
Drink till we fist fight
Life or death But you cant win with a vest
But there wont be no breathing for the reason
Punk bitch on your breath
I see day is dark and I admit its dark
So chase
Beware foolin marks
And yo Makaveli give me them bullets that was left for POs belly
And let me bust back to them niggas till they all sweatyShit tired of gettin shot at
Tired of gettin chased by the police and arrested
niggas need a spot where we can kick it
A spot where we belong thats just for us
niggas aint gotta get all dressed up and be Hollywood
Yknahmean Where do niggas go when we die
Aint no heaven for a thug nigga
Thats why we go to thug mansion
Thats the only place where thugs get in free and you gotta be a G
At thug mansion
A place to spend my quiet nights time to unwind
So much pressure in this life of mine
I cry at times I once contemplated suicide
and woulda tried but when I held that nine all I could see was my mommas eyes
No one knows my struggle they only see the trouble
Not knowin its hard to carry on when no one loves you
Picture me inside the misery of poverty
No man alive has ever witnessed struggles I survived
Prayin hard for better days promise to hold on
Me and my dawgs aint have a choice but to roll on
We found a family spot to kick it
Where we can drink liquor store and no one bickers over trick shit
A spot where we can smoke in peace and even though we Gs
We still visualize places that we can roll in peace
And in my minds eye I see this place the players go in fast
I got a spot for us all so we can ball at thugs mansion
Aint no place Id rather be
Chilren dead homies and family
Sky high iced out paradise in the sky
Aint no place Id rather be
Only place thats right for me
Chromed out mansion in paradise in the sky
Will I survive all the fights and the darkness
Trouble sparks they tell me home is where the heart is dear departed
I shed tattooed tears and couldnt sleep good
For multiple years witness peers catch gunshots
Nobody cares seen the politicians ban us
Theyd rather see us locked in chains please explain
Why they cant stand us is there a way for me to change
Or am I just a victim of things I did to maintain
I need a place to rest my head
With the little bit of homeboys that remains cause all the rest dead
Is there a spot for us to roll if you find it
Ill be right behind ya show me and Ill go
How can I be peaceful Im comin from the bottom
Watch my daddy scream peace while the other man shot him
I need a house thats full of love when I need to escape
The deadly places slingin drugs in thugs mansion
Aint no place Id rather be
Chilren dead homies and family
Sky high iced out paradise in the sky
Aint no place Id rather be
Only place thats right for me
Chromed out mansion in paradise in the sky
Dear momma dont cry your baby boys doin good
Tell the homies Im in heaven and they aint got hoods
Seen a show with Marvin Gaye last night
it had me shook drippin peppermint Schnapps with Jackie Wilson and Sam Cooke
Then some lady named Billie Holiday sang sittin there kickin it with Malcolm til the day came
Little LaTasha sho grown tell the lady in the liquor that shes forgiven so come home
Maybe in time youll understand only God can save us
When Miles Davis cuttin lose with the band
Just think of all the people that you knew in the past
That passed on they in heaven found peace at last
Picture a place that they exist together
There has to be a place better than this in heaven
So right before I sleep dear God what Im askin
Remember this face save me a place in thugs mansion
Aint no place Id rather be
Chilren dead homies and family
Sky high iced out paradise in the sky
Aint no place Id rather be
Only place thats right for me
Chromed out mansion in paradise in the sky
Aint no place Id rather be
Chilren dead homies and family
Sky high iced out paradise in the sky
Aint no place Id rather be
Only place thats right for me
Chromed out mansion in paradise in the skyOutlawz in this no doubt

Youre looking at a bitch who specialize in telling lies
She got a body make a motherfucker fantasize
Her face aint never shed a tear through them scandalous eyes
My sister Precious in poverty
Plus I knew she was a freak bitch so why should it bother me
Id probably be sprung addicted to the heat of her tongue
And though I dont where were going shes making me come
Ive been trained as a boss player so what you saying

Before I let her get me off guard
Went in the purse took a hundred dollars
Nigga Im so scandalous

Shes so scandalous shes so scandalous shes so scandalous
Scandalousshes so scandalous shes so scandalous
Shes so scandalous shes so scandalous shes so scandalous
Dangerous and ambitious while scheming on getting riches
Im spitting at tricks cause Im addicted to pretty bitches
Currency motivated not easily terminated
Now that we made it my niggas can never be faded
This is my prophecy I gotta be paid
All you cowards that try to stop me is begging for early graves
I thought we was cool I was a fool thinking you could be true
When I dont fuck with your punk crew
These are the tales for my niggas doing time in the cell
I went from hell to living well
Busting at niggas who said my name in vain
I got no time for them tricks Im heavy in the game
I wanna be a baller please
But the bitches and the liquor keep on calling me
Im floating free on the highway formulating plans
Cant wait til I see LA cause its so scandalous
Scandalous shes so scandalous shes so scandalous

You dont work you dont fuck you dont
You dont do a goddamn thing
I see death around the corner gotta stay high while I survive
In the city where the skinny niggas die
If they bury me bury me as a G nigga no need to worry
I expect retaliation in a hurry
I see death around the corner any day
Trying to keep it together no one lives forever anyway
Struggling and striving my destinys to die
Keep my finger on the trigger no mercy in my eyes
In a ball of confusion I think about my daddy
Madder than a motherfucker they never should of had me
I guess I seen too many murders the doctors cant help me
Got me stressin with my pistol in my sheets it aint healthy
Am I paranoid Tell me the truth
Im out the window with my AK ready to shoot
Ran out of endo and my mind cant take the stress
Im out of breath
Make me wanna kill my damn self
But I see death around the corner
When we were kids belonging felt good
I see death around the corner
But having respect that feels even better
I see death around the corner
When we were kids belonging felt good
I see death around the corner
But having respect that feels even better
I see death around the corner
The pressures getting to me
I no longer trust my homies
Them phonies tried to do me
Smoking too much weed
Got me paranoid stressed
Pack a gat and my vest
Under my clothes when I dress
Heres hopin I die the way I lived
Straight thuggin
Huggin my trigger for all them niggas
Who was buggin
My homie told me once
Dont you trust them other suckers
They fought like they your homies
But they phony motherfuckers
And even if I did die young who cares
All I ever got was mean mugs and cold stares
I got homies in my head
Who done passed away screaming please
Young nigga make Gs
I cant give up although Im hopeless
I think my minds gone
All I can do is get my grind on death around the corner
When we were kids belonging felt good
I see death around the corner
But having respect that feels even better
I see death around the corner
When we were kids belonging felt good
I see death around the corner
But having respect that feels even better
I was raised in the city shitty
Ever since I was an itty bitty kitty
Drinkin liquor out my mommas titty
And smokin weed was an everyday thing in my household
And drinking liquor til you out cold
And tho Im gone now nigga its still on- Pow
Busting on them niggas til they gone
How many more jealous ass bitches coming for my riches
Now I gotta stay suspicious when I bone
Cause if I aint sharp and heartless
Them bitches will start shit
Excuse me but this is where we part bitch
No more game for free please explain to me
Why niggas trip bitch who you came to see
Murderin now but see me later man as for my pops
I got homies that will hunt you til you drop
I hope the Lord will forgive me I was a G
And getting high was a way of getting free
I see death around the corner
When we were kids belonging felt good
I see death around the corner
But having respect that feels even better
I see death around the corner
When we were kids belonging felt good
I see death around the corner
But having respect that feels even better
This is for all the real motherfucking niggas out there
I know you aint scared to die
We all gotta go ya know
A real motherfucker will pick the time he goes
And make sure he handles his motherfucking business
Yall niggas stop acting like pussies out there
All right
Im tired off getting ripped off by guys like that
I want his family dead I want his house burned to the ground
I want to got there in the middle of the night
I wanna piss on his head
I want his family dead I want his house burned to the ground
I want to got there in the middle of the night
I wanna piss on his head
I want that sonova bitch dead I want him dead
I want him dead I dont careChorus K-Ci and JoJo
How do you want it How does it feel
Comin up as a nigga in the cash game
livin in the fast lane Im for real
How do you want it How do you feel
Comin up as a nigga in the cash game
livin in the fast lane Im for real
Love the way you activate your hips and push your ass out
Got a nigga wantin it so bad Im bout to pass out
Wanna dig you and I cant even lie about it
Baby just alleviate your clothes time to fly up out it
Catch you at a club oh shit you got me fiendin
Body talkin shit to me but I cant comprehend the meaning
Now if you wanna roll with me then heres your chance
Doin eighty on the freeway police catch me if you can
Forgive me im a rider still Im just a simple man
All I want is money fk the fame Im a simple man
Mr International playa with the passport
Just like Aladdin bitch get you anything you ask for
Its either him or me -- champagne Hennessey
A favorite of my homies when we floss on our enemies
Witness as we creep to a low speed peep what a hoe need
Puff some mo weed funk ya dont need
Approachin hoochies with a passion been a long day
But Ive been driven by attraction in a strong way
Your body is bangin baby I love it when you flaunt it
Time to give it to daddy nigga now tell me how you want it
Tell me how you want it La-dy yeahhhyeah
Chorus
Tell me is it cool to fk
Did you think I come to talk am I a fool or what
Positions on the floor its like erotic ironic
cause Im somewhat psychotic
Im hittin switches on bitches like I been fixed with hydraulics
Up and down like a roller coaster Im up inside ya
I aint quittin til the show is over cause Ima rider
In and out just like a robbery Ill probably be a freak
and let you get on top of me get her rockin these
Nights full of Alize a livin legend
You aint heard about these niggaz play these Cali days
Delores Tucker youse a motherfker
Instead of tryin to help a nigga you destroy a brother
Worse than the others -- Bill Clinton Mr Bob Dole
Youre too old to understand the way the game is told
Youre lame so I gotta hit you with the hot facts
Want some on lease Im makin millions niggaz top that
They wanna censor me theyd rather see me in a cell
livin in hell -- only a few of usll live to tell
Now everybody talkin bout us I could give a fk
Id be the first one to bomb and cuss
Nigga tell me how you want it
Chorus
Raised as a youth tell the truth I got the scoop
on how to get a bulletproof because I jumped from the roof
before I was a teenager mobile phone SkyPager
Game rules Im livin major -- my adversaries
is lookin worried they paranoid of gettin buried
One of us gon see the cemetary
My only hope to survive if I wish to stay alive
Gettin high see the demons in my eyes before I die
I wanna live my life and ball make a couple million
And then Im chillin fade em all these taxes

Media is in my business and they actin like they know me

Chorus

Tell me
Chorus
twoPac
Cash game livin in the fast lane Im for realIf you a bad boy
If you a bad boy then you die
Westside outlawz when we ride get me high
They fed up when the rob me
Put another contract on Mobb Deep
If you a bad boy then you die
Westside outlawz when we ride get me high
They fed up when the rob me
Put another contract on Mobb Deep
I focus my locus thought on my enemies
Sip off the Hennessey its necessary to finish me
Im in this social immortal when it comes to the phone book
Jersey them ns they think Im crazy and creepy
And as we speak they tryin to find me a therapist
Rapid fire I clap and hire till you die a liar
Strap in back to the corners droppin on to spin the tires
My man define ya three hundred and fifty-seven anaconda
This enough to bring your mama then turn around and hear the drama
Havoc I gotta have it steady blastin at Prodigy
Mobb six feet deep you try to blast me till death
And I suppose you got the dopest moves like Chucky on fresh
You know the verdict who what when why he died murdered
Get your physical diverted and your vision deserted
Ever since mama got fed and papa ducked out
Look at us murderous thugs showin less love in the drug house
Similar to savage its a wonder we manage
Bring chaos causin damage on our quest for cabbage
They ask my style similar to cash we flaunt it
Most wanted by the population murdered you for it
Exploit your weakness revenge flow deep without release
Criminal orders across the waters bringin the war to the streets
Why fear me fear the s I speak
Once this s drop its heard on every fin street
Like the sound of police who run the street really
And every hood let you grow
From the hustlaz up at Harlem to the shot callers in O
And though Congress dont want us to progress our step
My homie buried at an early age hustled to death
His last breath a lesson I posses like jewels
Stay thugged out keep it movin
Halfway thugs are bugged when we stalk the streets
Sort of like thugs and narcotics when we walk the streets
You speak the big p throw down and drop it
Hit you with six shots lay the law down and throw the shells in my pocket
Getting mine with nine coked extorting
Block shots with twenty-twos with my socks with the butt hangin out the chalk
You never seen time I travel across the mean crime
My rolls like a million dollar bills folded in green slime
With my foes erased drink my henney straight no chasin
Catch my body like Haitian five minutes from the station
Hit the hole like Allen Iverson with confidence
The bigger prick dont mean no evidence or proof the I was present
At the scene of the crime around ten ns bleed
After they made this punk fag motherfer bleed
All the money was bloody as s yall ns shoulda seen it
Bust a cap and freak with bow down on your knees s
The glock to your head n dont let inside action
Hit innocent by-standers when he blasted shot fin backwards
Little homies puttin work for stripes
But is it worth your life a g-rides runnin red lights
I wish somebody would have t old me then
Since Im an outlaw like Napolean aint no cell they can hold me in
Caucasian crazy like Arabians
Hold this spot like some ns fade me in having the scene chase me
When they want the product n I got the smoke
Got the weed and the coke what you need what you want
What you working with Im some immortal s
Outlawz we straight hurtin s use artillery to murder with
Put then on the box gangsta party like Pac
Lifes hard from the ox me and my ns on top
I know the law hate me dearly comin for me
We outlaws thugged out ns runnin on E
I know the law hate me dearly comin for me
We outlaws thugged out ns runnin on E
I know the law hate me dearly comin for me
We outlaws thugged out ns runnin on E
I know the law hate me dearly comin for me
We outlaws thugged out ns runnin on E
I know the law hate me dearly comin for me
We outlaws thugged out ns runnin on E
With the leaded Pac f the law
Carry steal cause I live in the n side of the law
Ridin foes cause I cant let hoes catch me slippin
Quick to blow and dispose if you block on hittin
Ridin high blazing kryptonite got a n dazing
Burpin and smurkin got on his knees before I grave em
Ride em look behind him I see him he slipped
At a stop light in a growin night this motherfen trick
Slide over so I can dip and put it in him
Damn I guess this motherfer know that I sent it
Hit the pedal now we high speeding
With the metal trying to make these motherfers die freezing
Up the way I seen him slow down
S I think Im gonna bust these hoes down
Caught them runnin on e it kind of funny to me
They know they was fin with me but they dumb to see
Open up fire watchin me spy when my shells split em
Plus all them tricks and the bes go to hell with em
F em they phony claimin they homies but the foes
Speakin on thug ns daily while we nailing they hoes
Explode boldly at my stage shows and formation
Words known to spray blaze as I raise my thug nation
Crooked thoughts cops get bought no longer caught
Did you cry when my girl died
Put out the hit politc ns worldwide grabbin my dick
Ill never learn take away the pain with sherm
Throwin gas on my enemies watchin them burn
Call my posse Im shootin up the casket take the body
Whip the corpse like a pinata and party
His last breath a straight lesson I posses like jewels
Stay thugged out keep it movin
If you a bad boy then you die
Westside outlawz when we ride get me high
They fed up when the rob me
Put another contract on Mobb DeepLord have mercy father help us all
Since you supplied your phone number I cant help but call
Time for action conversating we relaxing kicking back

Tongue-kissing hand full of hair look in my eyes

Me and you moving in the nude do it in the living room
Sweating up the sheets its the Thug in me

Kiss you soft on your stomach push my love inside

The pressures on Thug Life
When its on its on
One of these days Ill learn dont fuck with trick-ass niggas
Cause they turn into bitch-ass niggas
Im sick of bein stuck in the county jail
My niggas clown bring a pound when they postin bail
Smokin blunts in the driveway my fo-five
Screamin Fuck the police when we fly away thug til I die
You wonder why Im made this way
I wasnt turned out I was raised this way
Im thinkin these are the dreams of a young teen
Scheme to stack cream off of crack fiends
One-time cant hold me
One of these days we gotta bust back for the homies
Locked down in the penitentiary
Ill probably lose my mind if the pig sentence me
Im stressed smokin weed and nicotine
But what a nigga really need is Thorazine
Right before I die Ill be cursin the law
Reincarnated bitch even worse than befo
My fo-fo screamin payback
My underhanded plan to get them niggas while they laid back
And Big Stretch hit the scene with the mini-fourteen
Servin suckers like dope fiends empty the whole thing
Under pressure nigga haha thats right
Never run throw your gun in the air oh yeah
Nigga bust aint no time to spare
Cause the ruckus motherfucker and we fuck shit up
And with the stainless steel ribbon boy we cuttin shit up
Flash then blast a nigga with the quickness
Cock the four pound motherfucker when I spit this and rip this
Damn my mind is in the depths of hell
But when Im walking on the street kid my name rings bells
And I never fell nigga I stand too tall
Im just a thug motherfucker who was born to brawl
Givin my all so niggas wanna bring it to me
So Imma sell my cocaine and lay they ass down G
Uhh under pressure
Yeah look here though
Runnin wild I never smiled as a juvenile
Even now I keep a frown when I come around
Dont ask me bout the past it was all bad
Shots blasted will I last in the wrong path
In the dark is where my heart saw the most grief
Motherfuckers is gettin shanked over gold teeth
Am I sick cause Im addicted to gettin splifted
Watchin stupid-ass tricks get lifted
Nothings changed cause in the game its a steady aim
Fuck friends cause in the danger them niggas change
Puff weed and stuff Gs in my sock G
Car keys and Hennessy where the Glock be
Times passin will I last here another day
I put my gun away and grab my AK
Its gettin hectic I cant call it
House full of alcoholics now a niggas under pressure

I couldnt help but notice your pain
My pain
It runs deep
Share it with me
Theyll never take me alive
Im gettin high with my four-five
Cocked on these suckas
Time ta die
Even as a youngster
Causin ruckis on tha back of the bus
I was a fool all through high school
Kickin up dust
But now Im labeled as a trouble maker
Who can you blame
Smokin weed helped me take away the pain
So Im hopeless
Rollin down the freeway swervin
Dont worry
Im about to crash up on the curb cause my visions blurry
Maybe if they tried to understand me
What should I do
I had to feed my fuckin family
What else could I do
But be a thug
Out slangin with the homies
Fuck hangin with them phonies in the club
Got my mind on danger
Never been a stranger ta homicide
My cities full of gang bangers and drive bys
Why do we die at an early age
He was so young
But still a victom of the twelve gauge
My memories of a corpse
Mind full of sick thoughts
And I aint goin back to court
So fuck what you thought
Im drinkin hennessey
Runnin from my enemies
Will I live to be twenty-three
Theres so much pain
Chorus
Ohhhh
Tired of tha Strain and tha Pain
Ohhhh
Tired of tha Strain and tha Pain
Years and years of that rough life
Runnin crazed and wild as a kid and growin tough with a knife
And livin trifed on the regular
Bokin out competitors
See them take a move and take them down like a fuckin preditor
Get in trouble everyday in school
Act a fool
And you know I had to break every rule
Showin off for the bitches cause I had the mad rep
So I had to watch my back when it was time to step
with love for me
Pop pop pop
And send a chuckle up above for me
And yo come and seek but I didnt cry
Broke and head off with the pack and started sellin coke
And now Im tha one thats lookin lovely
Pop the drop top and all tha bitches want ta rub me
Kickem the game
Its all the same
I kick it back yo
Giveem slack yo
And now they lable me tha mack yo
People check it
Get disrespected if you front tha the birdman
You heard man
Catch a couple shots from tha glock in my hand
Damn
Release some realistic with my biscuit
You know you get your ass twisted so run for cover
Me and my man got a plan kickin major dust
So if your on nigga look for the gauge to bust
A lot of pressure with the street fame
Its a deep game
And my mama always cryin
Yo theres so much pain
Chorus
Ohhhh
Ohhhh
They got me mobbin like Im
Loced and ready to get my slug on
I load my clip and slip my motherfuckin gloves on
I aint scared to blast on these suckas if they test me
Trust
I got my glock cocked ready if they press me
Bust some motherfuckers with a PASSION
Better duck cause I aint lookin when Im BLASTIN
Im a nut and drinkin hennessey
And gettin high
On tha lookout for my enemies
Dont want to die
Tell me why
Cause this stress is gettin major
A buck fist across my face with my razor
What can I do but be a thug until Im dead and gone
Keep my brain on tha game and stay head strong
These sorry bastards
Want to kill me in my sleep but will they can I see
And everyday it just a struggle
Steady thuggin in the streets
And Ill be ballin loc
Dont letem make you worry
Keep swingin at these suckas till you buried
I was born to raise hell a nigga from the gutta
With a motha on drugs
Im kickin dust up
Ready ta bust

Until they kill me
Ill be livin this life
I know you feel me
Theres so much pain
Chorus

Lord knows its hard on a young scrub
It seems I had less problems when I slung drugs
But since Im tryin lace niggas with the game

Will I succeed paranoid from the weed
And hocus pocus I try to focus but I cant see
And in my mind Im a blind man doin time
Look to my future cause my past is all behind me
Is it a crime to fight for what is mine
Everybodys dyin tell me whats the use of tryin
Ive been Trapped since birth cautious cause Im cursed
And fantasies of my family in a hearse
And they say its the white man I should fear
But its my own kind doin all the killin here
I cant lie aint no love for the other side
Jealousy inside makeem wish I died
Oh my Lord tell me what Im livin for
Everybodys droppin got me knockin on heavens door
And all my memories of seein brothers bleed
And everybody grieves but still nobody sees
Recollect your thoughts dont get caught up in the mix
Cause the media is full of dirty tricks
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me only God
Only God can judge me now
Flatline
I hear the doctor standing over me
Screaming I can make it
Got a body full of bullet holes laying here naked
Still I cant breathe somethings evil in my IV
Cause everytime I breathe I think they killing me
Im having nightmares homicidal fantasies
I wake up stranglin danglin my bed sheets
I call the nurse cause it hurts to reminisce
How did it come to this I wish they didnt miss
Somebody help me tell me where to go from here
Cause even thugs cry but do the Lord care
Try to remember but it hurts
Im walking through the cemetery talking to the dirt
Id rather die like a man than live like a coward
Theres a ghetto up in Heaven and its ours Black Power
Is what we scream as we dream in a paranoid state
And our fate is a lifetime of hate
Dear Mama can you save me And fuck peace
Cause the streets got our babies we gotta eat
No more hesitation each and every black males trapped
And they wonder why we suicidal runnin round strapped
Mister police please try to see that theres
A million motherfuckers stressing just like me
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me only God
Only God can judge me now
That which does not kill me can only make me stronger
Thats for real
And I dont see why everybody feel as though
That they gotta tell me how to live my life
You know
Let me live baby let me live
Pac I feel ya keep servin it on the reala
For instance say a playa hatin mark is out to kill ya
Would you be wrong for buckin a nigga to the pavement
He gon get me first if I dont get him fool start prayin
Aint no such thing as self-defense in the court of law
So judge us when we get to where were goin wearin a cross thats real
Got him lurked him crept the fuck up on him

After talkin behind my back like a bitch would
Tellin them niggas You can fade him punk I wish you would

To get your safe knowin you on that paper chase
Grass glass big screen and leather couch

Used to catch us on the roof or behind the stairs
Im gettin blitzed and I reminsce on all the times we shared
Besides bumpin n grindin wasnt nothin on our mind
In time we learned to live a life of crime
Rewind us back to a time was much too young to know
I caught a felony lovin the way the guns blow
And even though we seperated you said that youd wait
Dont give nobody no coochie while I be locked up state
I kiss my Mama goodbye and wipe the tears from her lonely eyes
Said Ill return but I gotta fight the fates arrived
Dont shed a tear cause Mama I aint happy here

Most hated by enemy escape in the Luxury
See first you was our nigga but you made it so the choice is made
Now we gotta slay you why you faded in the younger days
So full of pain while the weapons blaze
Gettin so high off that bomb hopin we make it to the better days
Cause crime pays and in time youll find a rhymell blaze
Youll feel the fire from the niggaz in my younger days
So many changed on me so many tried to plot
That I keep a glock beside my head when will it stop
Til God return me to my essence
Cause even as a adolescents I refuse to be a convalescent
So many questions and they ask me if Im still down
I moved up out of the ghetto so I aint real now
They got so much to say but Im just laughin at cha
You niggaz just dont know but I aint mad at cha

Rebel rebel
They just cant stand the reign or the occasional pain
From a man like me who goes against the grain
Sometimes I do it in vain so with a little bass and treble
Hey Mister Its time for me to explain that Im the rebel
Cold as the devil
Straight from the underground the rebel a lower level
They came to see the maniac psychopath
The critics heard of me and the aftermath
I dont give a damn and it shows
And when I do a stage show I wear street clothes
So they all know me
The lyrical lunatic the maniac emcee
I give a shout out to your homies
And maybe then the criticsll leave your boy alone G
On the streets or on TV
It just dont pay to be a truth telling MC
They wont be happy till Im banned
The most dangerous weapon an educated black man
So point blank in your face pump up the bass
And join the human race
I throw peace to the Bay
Cause from the Jungle to Oaktown they backin me up all the way
You know you gotta love the sound
Its from the rebel the rebel of the underground
Rebel hes a rebel rebel of the underground
Rebel hes a rebel rebel of the underground
Rebel hes a rebel rebel of the underground
Rebel hes a rebel rebel of the underground
Now Im face to face with the devils
Cause they breeding more rebels than the whole damn ghetto
And police brutality
Shit it put you in the nip and call it technicality
So you reap what you sow
So reap the wrath of the rebel jacking em up once mo
Now the fox is in the hen house creeping up on your daughter
While you sleep I got her sneaking out
Tupac aint nothing nice
Ill be nothing how I wanna and doing what Im gonna
Now Im up to no good
The mastermind of mischief moving more than most could
So sit and slip into the sound
Peep the rebel the rebel of the underground
Rebel hes a rebel rebel of the underground
Rebel hes a rebel rebel of the underground
Rebel hes a rebel rebel of the underground
Rebel hes a rebel rebel of the underground
They say they hate me they wanna hold me down
I guess they scared of the rebel the rebel of the underground
But I never let it get me
I just make another record bout the punks trying to sweat me
In fact they trying to keep me out
Try to censor what I say
Cause they dont like what Im talking bout
So whats wrong with the media today
Got brothers selling out cause they greedy to get paid
But me Im coming from the soul
And if it dont go gold my story still getting told
And that way they cant stop me
And if it sells a couple of copies the punksll try to copy
Its sloppy dont even try to
Im a slave to the rhythm and Im about to fly through
So yo to the people in the ghetto
When ya hear the bass flow go ahead and let go
Now everybody wanna gang bang
They talking street slang but the punks still cant hang
They making records bout violence
But when it comes to the real some brothers go silent
It kinda make you wanna think about
That ya gotta do some selling out just to get your record out
But twoPacalpyse is straight down
So feel the wrath of the rebel the rebel of the underground
Rebel hes a rebel rebel of the underground
Rebel hes a rebel rebel of the underground
Rebel hes a rebel rebel of the underground

California Love
Lets show these fools how we do this on that west side
Cause you and I know its the best sidePerhaps I was addicted to tha dark side
Some where inside my childhood witnessed my heart die
And even though we both came from the same places
The money and the fame made us all change places
How could it be through the misery
That cant get past the hard times
Made a true friend afraid to ask for currency
But you could run to me when you need me Ill never leave
I just needed someone to believe in as you can see
Its a small thang through and true
What could I do Real homies help ya get through
And coming new hed do tha same thang if he could
cause in the hood true homies make you feel good
And happy times we be acting up call tha cops
Bringing the cease to tha peace that was on my block
It never stop when my mama ask me will I change
I tell her yeah but its clear Ill always be tha same
Until the end of time
So take these broken wings
Use your hands to come and heal me once again Until the end of time
So I can fly away until the end of time
Until the end of time until the end of time
Please Lord forgive me for my life of sin
My hard stare seem to scare all my sisters kids
So you know I dont hang around tha house much
Diss all night money making got me outta touch shit
Aint flashed a smile in a long while
An unexpected birth worst of the ghetto childs
My attitude got me walking solo
Ride out alone in my low-low
Watching the whole world move in slow-mo
For quiet times disappear to the ocean
Smoking Ports think my thoughts
Then its back to coasting
Who can I trust in this cold world
My phony homey had a baby by my own girl
But I aint trippin Im a player
I aint sweating him
I sex his sister had her mo good like a Mexican
His next of kin
No remorse it was meant to happen
Besides rapping the only thing I did good was scrapping
Until the end of time
So take these broken wings
Use your hands to come and heal me once again Until the end of time
So I can fly away until the end of time
Until the end of time until the end of time
So take these broken wings
Use your hands to come and heal me once again Until the end of time
So I can fly away until the end of time
Until the end of time until the end of time
Now whos to say if I was right or wrong
To live my life as an outlaw all along
Remain strong in this planet full of playa haters
They conversate but Death Row full of demonstrators
And in tha end drinking henessy made all my enemies envy me
So cold when I flow eliminating easily
Falls to they knees they plead for they right to breath
While beggin me to keep the peace haha
Well I can see close into achieve
In times of danger dont freeze time to be a g
Follow my lead I supply everything you need
An ounce of game and the trainin to make a g
Remember me as an outcast outlaw
Another album out thats what Im about more
Gettin raw till the day I see my casket
Buried as a g while tha whole world remembers me
Until the end of time
So take these broken wings
Use your hands to come and heal me once again Until the end of time
So I can fly away until the end of time
Until the end of time until the end of timeMakaveli in this Killuminati all through your body
The blows like a twelve gauge shotty feel me
And God said He should send his one begotten son
To lead the wild into the ways of the man
Follow me eat my flesh flesh and my flesh
Come with me Hail Mary
Run quick see what do we have here
Now do you wanna ride or die
I aint a killer but dont push me revenge is like the sweetest joy
Next to gettin pussy picture paragraphs unloaded
Wise words bein quoted peeped the weakness in the rap game
And sewed it bow down pray to God hoping that hes listenin
Seein niggaz comin for me to my diamonds when they glistenin
Now pay attention rest in peace father Im a ghost in these killin fields
Hail Mary catch me if I go lets go deep inside the solitary mind
Of a madman who screams in the dark evil lurks enemies

Instutionalized I lived my life a product made to crumble
But too hardened for a smile were too crazy to be humble
We ballin catch me father please cause Im fallin
In the liquor store thats the hennessee I hear ya callin
Can I get some more Hail til I reach hell I aint scared
Mama checkin in my bedroom I aint there

One life to live but I got nuttin to lose just me and you
On a one way trip to prison sellin drugs
We all wrapped up in this livin life as thugs
To my homeboys in Quentin Max doin they bid
Raise hell to this real shit and feel this

Thuggin eternal through my heart now Hail Mary nigga
Come with me Hail Mary
Run quick see what do we have here
Now do you wanna ride or die
Come with me Hail Mary
Run quick see what do we have here

Our enemies die now walk around half dead
Head down K blasted off hennessee and Thai
Tryin it mixed it now Im twisted blisted and high
Visions of me Thug livin gettin me by forever live
And I multiply survived by thugs when I die they wont cry
Unless they comin with slugs
Peep the whole scene and whatevers goin on around me
Brain kinda cloudy smoked out feelin rowdy
Ready to wet the party up and whoever in that motherfucker
Nasty new street slugger my heat seeks suckers
On the regular mashin in a black Ac Integ-ra
Cock back sixty seconds til the draw thats when Im dead in ya
Feet first you got a nice gat but my heats worse
From a thug to preachin church I gave you love now you eatin dirt
Needin work and I aint the nigga to put you on
Cause word is bond when I was broke I had to hustle til dawn

This life of sin done got the both of us in trouble
But you always stay down for a nigga so thats why I love you
Reminiscin needin tissues fightin over childish issues
Swear I cant live witchu but without you every day I miss you
When we roll you hold my pistol my gangsta bitch-ich
You always in the mood for love thats why Im sleepin witchu
Though not the man of your dreams my plan and schemes
To be rich like a king and live my life trouble free

Its a complicated world so girl just be a friend
I swear Ill never call you bitch again
And thats my word

I swear Ill never call you bitch again believe me
We came way too far pretty baby
To throw it all away throw it all away baby
I swear Ill never call you bitch again hey
I wake up early in the mornin at the crack of dawn
Nigga still tired so Im yawnin and now Im gone
Tryin to get my money on strong so an early riser
Out befo them other guys thats the way to profit every time
Cant get too close my enemies they see ghosts they envy me
Plus we been beefin with the east coast with casualites
Got stopped in traffic had a warrant so they gaffled me
But while Im gone watch my business and my back for me
My enemies think they got me crossed they aint knowin
Aint no love for player haters where you cowards goin
You paid bail got me out of jail home again
I promise not to leave you on your own again
Cristal corks are popped romantic thoughts are dropped
Its so frantic but dont panic cause we crossed the top
I found a partner and a rider a woman and friend
I swear Ill never call you bitch again believe me
We came too far to throw it all away
I swear Ill never call you bitch again believe me
We came way too far pretty baby
To throw it all away throw it all away
Youre my nigga my best friend
Never gonna call you a bitch again
Yeah yeah yeah ohh
Witness the evil men do all this shit I been through
Never meant to hurt you can we make this work Boo
I know you been feelin pain things are not the same
Waitin to exhale while Im sittin in the county jail
Keep yo head up cause things are gettin better
My cellmates shed tears off yo last love letter
Told em you would find a friend so keep yo eyes peeled
Sorry if I cuss but its the sufferin that I feel
Who can I trust and if I bust will she snitch
Even though you aint the type to trip
Sorry if I called you bitch
You showed me the definition of feminine
The difference between a pack of bitches and black women
I see the boss for the third time hope to see you soon
Pictures of us kissin in the living room in the nude
Thanks for bein there much more than a friend
I swear Ill never call you bitch again believe me
We came too far to throw it all away
We came way too far pretty baby
I swear Ill never call you bitch again believe me
We came too far to throw it all away
I swear Ill never call you bitch again believe me
We came way too far pretty baby
To throw it all away throw it all away
Through all my ups and downs
You always stayed around stayed aroundYou are appreciated
When I was young me and my mama had beef
Seventeen years old kicked out on the streets
Though back at the time I never thought Id see her face
Aint a woman alive that could take my mamas place
Suspended from school and scared to go home I was a fool
With the big boys breaking all the rules
I shed tears with my baby sister
Over the years we was poorer than the other little kids
And even though we had different daddys the same drama
When things went wrong wed blame mama
I reminisce on the stress I caused it was hell
Hugging on my mama from a jail cell
And whod think in elementary
Hey I see the penitentiary one day
And running from the police thats right
Mama catch me put a whooping to my backside
And even as a crack fiend mama
You always was a black queen mama
I finally understand
For a woman it aint easy trying to raise a man
You always was committed
A poor single mother on welfare tell me how ya did it
Theres no way I can pay you back
But the plan is to show you that I understand
You are appreciated
Lady
Dont ya know we love ya Sweet lady
Dear mama
Place no one above ya sweet lady
You are appreciated
Dont ya know we love ya
Now aint nobody tell us it was fair
No love from my daddy cause the coward wasnt there
He passed away and I didnt cry cause my anger
Wouldnt let me feel for a stranger
They say Im wrong and Im heartless but all along
I was looking for a father he was gone
I hung around with the Thugs and even though they sold drugs
They showed a young brother love
I moved out and started really hanging
I needed money of my own so I started slanging
I aint guilty cause even though I sell rocks
It feels good putting money in your mailbox
I love paying rent when the rents due
I hope ya got the diamond necklace that I sent to you
Cause when I was low you was there for me
And never left me alone because you cared for me
And I could see you coming home after work late
Youre in the kitchen trying to fix us a hot plate
Ya just working with the scraps you was given
And mama made miracles every Thanksgiving
But now the road got rough youre alone
Youre trying to raise two bad kids on your own
And theres no way I can pay you back
But my plan is to show you that I understand
You are appreciated
Lady
Dont ya know we love ya Sweet lady
And dear mama
Place no one above ya sweet lady
You are appreciated
Dont ya know we love ya
Pour out some liquor and I reminisce cause through the drama
I can always depend on my mama
And when it seems that Im hopeless
You say the words that can get me back in focus
When I was sick as a little kid
To keep me happy theres no limit to the things you did
And all my childhood memories
Are full of all the sweet things you did for me
And even though I act crazy
I gotta thank the Lord that you made me
There are no words that can express how I feel
You never kept a secret always stayed real
And I appreciate how you raised me
And all the extra love that you gave me
I wish I could take the pain away
If you can make it through the night theres a brighter day
Everything will be alright if ya hold on
Its a struggle everyday gotta roll on
And theres no way I can pay you back
But my plan is to show you that I understand
You are appreciated
Lady
Dont ya know we love ya Sweet lady
And dear mama
Place no one above ya sweet lady
You are appreciated
Dont ya know we love ya
Sweet lady
And dear mama
Dear mama

Prepare for panic when I unleash
Niggas is lucky if they leave here in one piece
Queen Puff never had no heart to start
So how the hell Biggie Smalls get the part

And swing hard on motherf-ckers thats my thing

They say Pac aint got love for the eastside
You a lying motherf-cker nigga we ride
Watch ya mouthMy road to glory is filled with thorns
Fluent thoughts from my brain and I train to remain strong
They said I couldnt do it
Lock me in chains til I
My struggles closer to the pain of a trained killer
Please believe that Ill never be shamed again
But can I be the next heavyweight champion
Call me crazy but no one can fade me
Im the product of the projects
Lost and crazy
Throw your hands up Mr Bruno why
Big Mike Tyson bout to brutalize that ass tonight
No hesitation in front of the whole nation
I beat that ass so bad I probably violate probation
Through demonstration as I strategize information
Intend to kill so its real like Im catching cases
Ha-ha
Let the world know I plan to die
If I dont leave with what I came for Ill be denied
Chorus
Now my first round is for the times that I sit in this cell
The second round is for the media and the lies they tell
My third round is for the pain that I felt inside
Best recognize I wont be denied when we rideDJ Quik
Yo this is DJ Quik
Taking a second out with Tha Dogg Pound to let yall know something
If youre looking in the Source mag and dont see me
Its cause some niggaz on the East is the enemy
Its real
Kurupt
I heard of Meth Nas and Red
Im down with them
Indeed we all smoke weed and clown wit um
Hung around wit um
One women
I ran with his clan
There is only one land
Niggas down with me I can count on one hand
Come dumb I gets dumber
The double barrel pumper heat dumper
And I been rockin mics since Funky Drummer
These adventures wreak Havok speak lavish lifestyles
I crack your clavical for the cabbage
Rhyme savage
Introduction to death
Murder MCs til aint shit left
In the sector
Why must MCs flip like gymnastics
Just to get they whole ass whipped
Claim to be classic
But you dont set no classic examples
With ya
Fucked up beats
And ya fucked up samples
Your last verbal war
You wont survive no more
I turned the channel cause niggas you aint live no more
I used to follow
But now yous a legend like Sleepy Hallow
I shoot to kill the horse pill u cant swallow
Theres no tomorrow
Nigga it all ends
I been down with KRS since Boggie Down begins
Thats my man
Now whats this I hear
I was told to beware
Im the inspirer
Dissed by a nigga I admired
Hell no this cant be
Now who the fuck is this I hear on the radio dissin me
BI double GI to the E
Shit scorchin
Doing a video for a song
That got blew out of porportion
I found hes the deadliest force
In a world where it all about glamour fame and fortune
Nigga we Mob Deep
So fuck you Jeru and any Tribe that Quests to compete
We the elite
The psycho assassin is blastin
And next time you hit LA nigga we mashin
Deadly Threat
-----------------------
Daz
Eyo Threat I play the MC
Niggaz they played the mic
I bash motherfuckers from words that I recite
Tighter than the average MC
Trynna battle me
Tragedy is a must
As I crush NYC
Lately I been on some crazy shit
Imagine this
To make it til you die
Until you out of it
your hood from murders
Roaming through your house and murder
When you wake up in the morning
Your life will be over
I told ya
Dogg Pound aint nathan nice
Sacrificing motherfuckers
From into mics
Twice
Theres been a murder on your block
When he drop
Your homie thought he was nutty
What made him I roll a glock
You stop us
But when we started mashin aint no stoppin
On and on more of your dogs keep droppin
What was your homie aint yo homie no mo
Commit suicide and blow your brains on the floor
Dont ingore the fact
Grab the microphone and snap
Then react with the shit that jumped off that nightGot me thinking about better days
Time to question our lifestyle look how we live
Smokin weed like it aint no thang
so even kids wanna try now
They lie down and get ran through
Nobody watched em clockin the evil man do
Faced with the demons
addicted to hearin victims screamin
Guess we was evil since birth
product of cursed semens
Cause even our birthdays is cursed days
A born thug in the first place The worst ways
Id love to see the block in peace
with no more dealers and crooked cops
the only way to stop the beast
And only we can change
Its up to us to clean up the streets
It aint the same
Too many murders
too many funerals and too many tears
Just seen another brother buried
plus I knew him for Years
Passed by his family but what could I say
Keep Yo head up and try to keep the faith
Try To Keep The Faith
Who wouldve guessed that in my future years
Id be stressin Some say the ghettos a sick and corrupted
Plus my PO wont let me hang with the brother I grew up with
Try to keep my head up and stay strong
All my homies slangin Ilello all day long
But they wrong So Im solo and so broke
Savin up for some Jordans cause they Dope
I got a girl and I love ger but she broke too
And so am I I Cant take her to places she wanna go to
So we argue and play fight all day and night
Makin passionate love til the daylight
Plus we about to get evicted cant pay the rent
Guess its time to see who really is yo friend
Tell me you pregnant and Im amazed
So many blessings while we stressin
But what can I say Keep yo head up and
Try to keep the faith
Try to keep the faith
Try to keep the faith
Square fools Since back in high school
we was true me and you hardly parted or separeted
we stayed faded
Affiliated with gangbanger and still made it
Up in the gym mess with me gotta mess with him
Still dressin like grown men when rollin
I went to dark smoking Newports gamin marks
Got a place in my heart homie stay smart
Locked you up in the pen
and gave you three to ten
I send you letters with naked flicks of old friends
Hopin you well I know its hell doin time in the cells
You need mail when you in jail
And me Im doin cool
I Settled down had a family
workin in night school
Every once in a while
I reminisce and wonder how we ever came to thisHey whyd you slang crack
I had to
Whyd you slang crack
Cause I had to
Whyd you slang crack
Cause I had to
A nigga gotta pay the fuckin rent
Crazy I gotta look at what you gave me
You claimin Ima criminal when you the one that made me
They got me trapped in this slavery
Now Im lost in this holocaust headin for my grave G
I told Sam he could fuck the war
And got a busted jaw for sayin Fuck the law
And if you wonder why Im mad check the record
Whats a nigga gotta do to get respected
Sometimes I think Im getting tested
And if I dont say Yes a nigga quick to get arrested
Thats the reason I stay zestin
I keep a vest on my chest incase the cops is getting restless
Walkin round ready to light shit up
And since my life is fucked some say Im slightly nuts
Buck buck is the sound as I move up
Other niggas pay attention when a fool bust
They make a nigga be a killer
I used to be a dealer but they wanted to see whos realer
Now them same motherfuckas wanna murder me
And I wonder if the Lord ever heard of me
I need loot so Im doin what I do
And dont say shit until youve walked in my shoes
Theres no other destiny to choose
I had nothing left to lose so Im singin the po nigga blues
Whyd you slang crack
Cause I had to
Whyd you slang crack
Cause I had to
Whyd you slang crack
Cause I had to
A nigga gotta pay the fuckin rent
Pappa need brand new shoes but what the fuck can a nigga do
My little boy gotta eat too
So why must I sock a fella Just live large like Rocafella
And did you ever stop to think Im old enough to go to war
But I aint old enough to drink
Cops wanna hit me with the book and youre hooked on my
I dont give a fuck look
Makin rules Ima break em no matter how much you make em
You show me bacon Ima take em
So dont you ever tempt me Im a fool for mine nigga
And my pockets stay empty
To my brother in the barrio
Youre livin worse then the niggas in ghetto so
I give a fuck about your language or complexion
You got love for the niggas in my section
You got problems with the punk police
Dont run from the chumps get the pump from me
We aint free Ill be damned if I played a chip
For a blond haired blue eyed Caucasian bitch
Down with my home boy rich
Fuck a snitch and groupie ass bitch
And a nigga with a cellular phone
Leave his baby at home so he can go out and bone
And you wonder why we blazin niggas
Cause you punks havin babies cant raise the niggas
And they damned to be fuck ups too
Drink fortys of brew singin the nigga blues
Whyd you slang crack
Cause I had to
Whyd you slang crack
Cause I had to
Whyd you slang crack
Cause I had to
Now Im headin for the motherfuckin pen
Whyd you slang crack
Cause I had to
Whyd you slang crack
Cause I had to
Whyd you slang crack
Cause I had to
Now Im headin for the motherfuckin pen
Whyd you slang crack
Cause I had to
Whyd you slang crack
Cause I had to
Whyd you slang crack
Cause I had to
Now Im headin for the motherfuckin pen
Yeah
Oo yeah
Oo yeah
Aye noA career is wonderful but you cant curl up with it on a cold night
An actress is not a machine but they treat you like a machine A money machine
Dogs never bite me Just humans
Hollywood is a place where theyll pay you a thousand dollars for a kiss and fifty cents for your soul
I am invariably late for appointments - sometimes as much as two hours Ive tried to change my ways but the things that make me late are too strong and too pleasing
I am not interested in money I just want to be wonderful
I dont know who invented high heels but all women owe him a lot
I dont mind living in a mans world as long as I can be a woman in it
I dont mind making jokes but I dont want to look like one
I restore myself when Im alone
Im very definitely a woman and I enjoy it
Ive never dropped anyone I believed in
Its all make believe isnt it
Its better to be unhappy alone than unhappy with someone - so far
Its not true I had nothing on I had the radio on
No one ever told me I was pretty when I was a little girl All little girls should be told theyre pretty even if they arent
Sex is a part of nature I go along with nature
The body is meant to be seen not all covered up
The trouble with censors is that they worry if a girl has cleavage They ought to worry if she hasnt any
To put it bluntly I seem to have a whole superstructure with no foundation But Im working on the foundation
What do I wear in bed Why Chanel No five of course
the ones ilove the most have a --Black cotton
Black cotton
Black cotton a symbol for unrewarded struggle
Time for a little gospel tail
Ghetto gospel that is- listen
Robbin Black Cotton in Gods eyes
Speak
Black Cotton
Steady stressin Smith and Wessons count my blessins
Class is in session the worst question is the first question
Why do we work like slaves sweatin blades to an early grave
Never got paid but still we slave In the nine tre
Answer that then answer this too-
Loves gonna get ya you know its true lifes a b true
You best to backtrack and try to act black and live
Not to be phony and positive but why be negative
Whats the matter G Black cat got your tongue
Fat track gotcha sprung now your hung Do ya feel me
Dumb dumb diddy is it me
Attempt to reach each and every brother on the streets
If not peace then at least lets get a piece
Im tired of seeing bodies on the streets- deceased
Lookin through my high school yearbook
Reminiscin of the tears as the years took
One homie two homie three homies poof
We used to have troops but now theres no more youth to shoot
God come save the misbegotten
Lost ghetto souls of Black Cotton In Gods eyes
Nobody dont care
No matter how hard I try look to the sky
Nobody dont care
Seems like my dreams drowned in by screams no answer to my questions
Nobody dont care
Feels like Im pressed why do I stress Its like Im being tested
Nobody dont care
Seems like my prayers vanish to thin air please answer my questions
Nobody dont care
In the belly of the beast Im bubbling up
Running out of luck about to self destruct
Old heads say live your life like such
Your sure to catch her witcha one day boy
I wouldnt listen to em
Your power movement was cool
But it aint fix nothin
So I just go with what I know
I dont trust none
Look what the eightys did
To whats Bebes kids
And now we grown up
Nobody aint own us yet
Black cotton Im plottin
Im workin without a profit
They shacklin all my homies
Im hurtin but keep the mind

Certainly we survive with Outlaw Ridas
Whats the reward for a strugala
If the lord lovin us then why they hate to see us comin up
Runnin up Gun ced like nasty gloves
If you aint got a penny mind the glove
No love
Waitin for my forty acas and a blunt to blaze
Biblicle times good hearts with militia minds
Black Cotton Im hoppin over enemy lines
Black Cotton I aint stoppin till they givin me mine
Black Cotton
Nobody dont care
No matter how hard I try look to the sky
Nobody dont care
Seems like my dreams drowned in by screams no answer to my questions
Nobody dont care
Feels like Im pressed why do I stress Its like Im being tested
Nobody dont care
Seems like my prayers vanish to thin air please answer my questions
Nobody dont careoohhhhh
yeh
come on come on
onest Verse
I see no changes
I wake up in the morning and I ask myself
Is life worth livin should I blast myself
Im tired of bein poor and even worse Im black
My stomach hurts so Im lookin for a purse to snatch
Cops give a damn about a Negro
Pull the trigga kill a nigga hes a hero
Sell the crack the the kids who the hell cares
One less hungry mouth on the welfare
First ship em dope and let em deal the brothas
Give em guns step back and watch em kill each other
Its time to fight back thats what Huey said
Two shots in the dark now Hueys dead
I got love for my brotha but we can never go nowhere
Unless we share wit each other
We gotta start makin changes
Learn to see me as a brotha instead-a two distant strangers
And thats how its pose to be
How can the Devil take a brotha if hes close to me
Id love to go back to when we played as kids but things change
And thats the way it is
chorus
thats just the way it is
things will never be the same

I see no changes all I see is racist faces
Misplaced hate makes disgrace to races
We under I wonder what it takes to make this
One better place lets erase the wasted
Take the evil out the people theyll be actin right
Cuz both black and white is smokin crack tonight
And the only time we chill is when we kill each otha
It takes skill to be real time to heal each other
And I know it seems heaven sent
We aint ready to see a black presidant unh
it aint a secret dont conceal the facts the penitentiaries packed
And its filled with blacks
But some things will never change
Ya try to show anotha way but ya stayin in the dope game
Now tell me whats a motha to do
Bein real dont appeal to the brotha in you
You gotta operate the easy way
I made a G today but you made it in a sleezy way
Sellin crack to the kids I gotta get paid
Well hey well thats the way it is
Come on come on
chorus
thats just the way it is
things will never be the same
thats just the ways it is
aaw yeah
thats just the way it is
things will never be the same
thats just the ways it is

Talking
You gotta make a change
Its time for us as a people to start makin some changes
Lets change the way we eat lets change the way we live
And lets change the way we treat each other
You see the old way wants workin so its on us to do what we gotta do to survive
threerd Verse
And still I see no changes
Cant a brotha get a little peace
Theres war on the streets and war on the Middle east
Instead of a war on poverty
They got a war on drugs so the police can bother me
And I aint never did a crime i aint have to do
But now Im back with the facts givin it back to you
So dont let em jack you up back you up crack you up and pimp smack you up
Ya gotta learn to hold ya own
They get jealous when they see ya with ya mobile phone
But tell the cops they cant touch this
I dont trust this when they try to rush I bust this
Its the sound on my tool you it aint cool
My mama didnt raise no fool
And as long as I stay black I gotta stay strapped and i never get to lay back
Cuz I always gotta worry bout the payback
Of some ruff that i ruffed up way back
Comin back after all these years

You know how that is stay down for mine
Outlaw look
Now weve been kickin it for quite some time
Remained beside me through my trials in this life of crime
We divorced so many times I forgot to count
I never hit you not a coward rather leave your house
Remember back in December when we was tight
Sippin Alize and Cristal whylin every night in my bedroom
Promised that I commit to you soon
Tongue-kissed me every time you seen me step inside a room
Straight out the hood
We promised to be good to each other plus I love you
So I know you gon make a good mother
Just try to understand if I change at times
Its only cause I never owned anything thats mine
So Im tryin you can stay with my momma but keep the drama to a low
Never call the police I never call you bitch and ho
We were all born hungry in this world alone
Finally moved out my moms house and got a happy home
Happy home lets turn this house into a happy home
Happy home finally made it out my moms house got a happy home
Happy home turn this house into a happy home
Happy home
Goin through hard times ghetto child of mine
I wonder if you have to suffer for your fathers crimes
To be honest its a hard road
Just keep your faith in God knowin youll get scarred though
Look at him walkin and talkin a lil child with my eyes and mouth
Father watch over lil seeds help me guide them out
Had to change my whole lifestyle married my babys momma
Made her my wife now Im tryin hard yall
Maybe in time Ill be a better man
Watchin the older couples handle it like veterans
Show me the meaning of forever and together we rise
If it would help our child grow then together wed die
Why question my love its so easy to see
Without my family all Im left with is a shadow of me
After all the arguments and the nights alone
Now its time to live the good life inside a happy home
Happy home lets turn this house into a happy home
Happy home finally made it out my moms house got a happy home
Happy home turn this house into a happy home
Happy home

Hey haha turn this house into a happy home
Long as one of us got it some of us got it
Turn this house into a happy homeI aint got time for this man Im out
You should stop for awhile you will find me standing there Dont you trust me
Over here at the side of your life Not that I dont trust you
You spend all your hours just rushing around
Do you have a little time to have a little time for me
As soon as I leave the house you want to page me
See you got me trapped Im going crazy this is slavery
You act like its outrageous give me space it wont get better
And maybe we will argue and be through with all these sorry letters
Soon as I come home its like I get the third degree
Where ya been and who you with I get no room to breathe It makes me want to leave
Im sick of these tricks up your sleeve
Your suspicious I deceive give me grief without belief but to me
If you really trust me then its pitiful
Question me about my whereabouts thats so trivial
Let me live my life and you can live yours
Just be there to help me and support thats what your here for
Not to give me stress and add to pressure
Home is where I go the rest I go to pass the test
Im sorry if I left you all alone
But I couldnt make it home so we argue on the phone
Dont you trust me
You should stop for awhile you will find me standing there Dont you trust me
Over here at the side of your life Not that I dont trust you
You spend all your hours just rushing around
Do you have a little time to have a little time for me
Callin up my house to hang it up You think that makes sense
Tell me what it takes for us to shake so we can be friends
Its time for us to take our separate paths
We had a lot of laughs but the good things come to pass
Lets think of the evil break dont make it scandoulous
Try to be mature til your sure that we can handle this
Your sayin Im too busy I ignore you
I guess you didnt hear me when I said that I cared for you
But now it seems the arguments are nightly
I want to hold you tightly but instead you want to fight me
So why let it stress and aggravate me
Instead Id rather break hope you dont hate me
You tell me that you love me but your lyin
Fightin back the urge to start cryin
I wipe away your tears come and hug me
I love you like you love me
Girl dont you trust me
You should stop for awhile you will find me standing there Dont you trust me
Over here at the side of your life Not that I dont trust you
You spend all your hours just rushing around
Do you have a little time to have a little time for me
I hangup the phone click
I cant barely hear you yellin at me
Maybe we should end it neither one of us are happy
You know that Im emotional you milk me
Comin over crying just to get me feelin guilty
You and me were met to be it yet
You always want to sweat and how much closer can we get dont fret
Just set me back my things and Ill be outie
This time Im breakin out you let your mouth overcrowd me
I cant take the beefin and the griefin
I get no room to sleep I hope it ceases cause Im leavin
Maybe next time youll be a little more sure
When I can give you more when you unsure
But baby until then I gotta leave ya
Its not that I dont need ya but see ya
And I hope that you understand why I bust it
Not because we rushed it hell no
But girl dont you trust me
You should stop for awhile you will find me standing there Dont you trust me
Over here at the side of your life Not that I dont trust you
You spend all your hours just rushing around
Do you have a little time to have a little time for me
Not that I dont trust you
Dont you trust me
Not that I dont trust you
Dont you trust me
Not that I dont trust youNigga westside

I focus my locus thought on my enemies
Sip off the Hennessey its necessary to finish me
Im in this social immortal when it comes to the phone book
Jersey them niggas they think Im crazy and creepy
And as we speak they tryin to find me a therapist
Rapid fire I clap and hire till you die a liar
Strap in back to the corners droppin on to spin the tires
My man define ya three hundred and fifty-seven anaconda
This enough to bring your mama then turn around and hear the drama
Havoc I gotta have it steady blastin at Prodigy
Mobb six feet deep you try to blast me till death
And I suppose you got the dopest moves like Chucky on fresh
You know the verdict who what when why he died murdered
Get your physical diverted and your vision deserted
Ever since mama got fucked and papa ducked out
Look at us murderous thugs showin less love in the drug house
Similar to savage its a wonder we manage
Bring chaos causin damage on our quest for cabbage
They ask my style similar to cash we flaunt it
Most wanted by the population murdered you for it
Exploit your weakness revenge flow deep without release
Criminal orders across the waters bringin the war to the streets
Why fear me fear the shit I speak
Once this shit drop its heard on every fuckin street
Like the sound of police who run the street really
And every hood let you grow
From the hustlaz up at Harlem to the shot callers in O
And though Congress dont want us to progress our step
My homie buried at an early age hustled to death
His last breath a lesson I posses like jewels
Stay thugged out keep it movin
Halfway thugs are bugged when we stalk the streets
Sort of like thugs and narcotics when we walk the streets
You speak the big pussy throw down and drop it
Hit you with six shots lay the law down and throw the shells in my pocket
Getting mine with nine coked extorting
Block shots with twenty-twos with my socks with the butt hangin out the chalk
You never seen time I travel across the mean crime
My rolls like a million dollar bills folded in green slime
With my foes erased drink my henney straight no chasin
Catch my body like Haitian five minutes from the station
Hit the hole like Allen Iverson with confidence
The bigger prick dont mean no evidence or proof the I was present
At the scene of the crime around ten niggas bleed
After they made this punk fag motherfucker bleed
All the money was bloody as shit yall niggas shoulda seen it
Bust a cap and freak with bow down on your knees shit
The glock to your head nigga dont let inside action
Hit innocent by-standers when he blasted shot fuckin backwards
Little homies puttin work for stripes
But is it worth your life a g-rides runnin red lights
I wish somebody would have t old me then
Since Im an outlaw like Napolean aint no cell they can hold me in
Caucasian crazy like Arabians
Hold this spot like some niggas fade me in having the scene chase me
When they want the product nigga I got the smoke
Got the weed and the coke what you need what you want
What you working with Im some immortal shit
Outlawz we straight hurtin shit use artillery to murder with
Put then on the box gangsta party like Pac
Lifes hard from the ox me and my niggas on top

Burpin and smurkin got on his knees before I grave em
Ride em look behind him I see him he slipped
At a stop light in a growin night this motherfucken trick
Slide over so I can dip and put it in him
Damn I guess this motherfucker know that I sent it
Hit the pedal now we high speeding
With the metal trying to make these motherfuckers die freezing
Up the way I seen him slow down
Shit I think Im gonna bust these hoes down
Caught them runnin on e it kind of funny to me
They know they was fuckin with me but they dumb to see
Open up fire watchin me spy when my shells split em
Plus all them tricks and the bitches go to hell with em
Fuck em they phony claimin they homies but the foes
Speakin on thug niggas daily while we nailing they hoes
Explode boldly at my stage shows and formation
Words known to spray blaze as I raise my thug nation
Crooked thoughts cops get bought no longer caught

Throwin gas on my enemies watchin them burn

Outlaw ridahs biatchHehehe these are my words to my first born
Can you picture young nz in a rush to grow
Til hard timers in the pen had to crush his throat
Probably never even saw it comin too busy bullstin
Caught him with his mouth runnin aint this a b
They got me twisted in this game
The feds and the punk po-lice pointin pistols at my brain
I wonder if Im wrong cause Im thugged out
My homies murdered execution style runnin in the drug house
What was supposed to be a easy hit now s is flipped
Cause ns died over bulls its not my dream
Im seein pictures of a broken man no witnesses
Only the questions of who smoked the man young adolescents
In our prime live a life of crime though it aint logical
We hobble through these tryin times livin blind
Lord help me with my troubled soul
Why all my homies had to die fore they got to grow
And right before I put my head on the pillow say a prayer one love
To the thugs in heaven Ill see you there
Its written for the young and dumb that wasnt warned
Help you make it through the storm
My words to my first born feel me
My words to my first born
My words to my first born
Since my very first day on this earth I was cursed
So I knew that the birth of a child would make my life worse
And though it hurt me there was no distortion
Cause wild seeds cant grow we need more abortions
Quiet your soul cause you know what you had to do
And so did victims of a world they never came to
I understand its a better day comin
Sometimes cats be sleepin on the dead end
Drivin with the car runnin blinded
Aint no love in the hood only hearts torn
Love letters to the innocent and unborn
All the babies that died up on the table
Wasnt able to breathe cause the family wasnt able
Cant blame her I would do the same
All I could give it was my debt and my last name
Cause in the game things change livin up and down
This hard life got me walkin with my head down
Flashin frowns wasnt meant to be was I wrong
But Ill never get to know so I carry on
Its written for the young and dumb that wasnt born
My words to my first born feel me
My words to my first born
Mm Yeah These are the words to my first born
Hey n talk to your born talk to your seed n
Two thousand somethin somethin its a new era
A ns too real now see s too clear
See theres more than just this scrilla and this tilt
What else is it dawg
The velvet and the silk and makin sure my kittens got they milk
Hoo Gotta fill this mattress let my kids know Im at this
Attack this the Mack must roll hood stroll
Aint no question is it Above the Law hustlers
If its related to chips homey well handle ya
Yo
Although we never take advantage though we always into erythang
By all means stack green gangsta lean
They say money make the world go round
So only ssociate yourself with paper chasers
And nz thats truly down and keep God first
And give thanks for the good times as well as when it hurts
Its player haters every corner you hit
Touchin their tits hella thick tryin to get you for yo grip
I know you stressed out and fed up
But come out gun-blazin and keep yo head up
You can call it what you want to but it aint gon change
Above the Law twoPac OGs in this rap game
And we done lived a long hard life
And we done shed so many tears under these bright lights
Yall although we grew up corrupted and scorned
We still got a lot of wisdom to give to our first born
What you gon tell your kids n
Who was you What was you doin How did you put it down
These my words to my motherfin first born
So they can know whyknahmean He he he

If you a bad boy then you die
Westside outlawz when we ride get me high
They fed up when the rob me
Put another contract on Mobb Deep
If you a bad boy then you die
Westside outlawz when we ride get me high
They fed up when the rob me
Put another contract on Mobb Deep
I focus my locus thought on my enemies
Sip off the Hennessey its necessary to finish me
Im in this social immortal when it comes to the phone book
Jersey them ns they think Im crazy and creepy
And as we speak they tryin to find me a therapist
Rapid fire I clap and hire till you die a liar
Strap in back to the corners droppin on to spin the tires
My man define ya three hundred and fifty-seven anaconda
This enough to bring your mama then turn around and hear the drama
Havoc I gotta have it steady blastin at Prodigy
Mobb six feet deep you try to blast me till death
And I suppose you got the dopest moves like Chucky on fresh
You know the verdict who what when why he died murdered
Get your physical diverted and your vision deserted
Ever since mama got fed and papa ducked out
Look at us murderous thugs showin less love in the drug house
Similar to savage its a wonder we manage
Bring chaos causin damage on our quest for cabbage
They ask my style similar to cash we flaunt it
Most wanted by the population murdered you for it
Exploit your weakness revenge flow deep without release
Criminal orders across the waters bringin the war to the streets
Why fear me fear the s I speak
Once this s drop its heard on every fin street
Like the sound of police who run the street really
And every hood let you grow
From the hustlaz up at Harlem to the shot callers in O
And though Congress dont want us to progress our step
My homie buried at an early age hustled to death
His last breath a lesson I posses like jewels
Stay thugged out keep it movin
Halfway thugs are bugged when we stalk the streets
Sort of like thugs and narcotics when we walk the streets
You speak the big p throw down and drop it
Hit you with six shots lay the law down and throw the shells in my pocket
Getting mine with nine coked extorting
Block shots with twenty-twos with my socks with the butt hangin out the chalk
You never seen time I travel across the mean crime
My rolls like a million dollar bills folded in green slime
With my foes erased drink my henney straight no chasin
Catch my body like Haitian five minutes from the station
Hit the hole like Allen Iverson with confidence
The bigger prick dont mean no evidence or proof the I was present
At the scene of the crime around ten ns bleed
After they made this punk fag motherfer bleed
All the money was bloody as s yall ns shoulda seen it
Bust a cap and freak with bow down on your knees s
The glock to your head n dont let inside action
Hit innocent by-standers when he blasted shot fin backwards
Little homies puttin work for stripes
But is it worth your life a g-rides runnin red lights
I wish somebody would have t old me then
Since Im an outlaw like Napolean aint no cell they can hold me in
Caucasian crazy like Arabians
Hold this spot like some ns fade me in having the scene chase me
When they want the product n I got the smoke
Got the weed and the coke what you need what you want
What you working with Im some immortal s
Outlawz we straight hurtin s use artillery to murder with
Put then on the box gangsta party like Pac
Lifes hard from the ox me and my ns on top
I know the law hate me dearly comin for me
We outlaws thugged out ns runnin on E
I know the law hate me dearly comin for me
We outlaws thugged out ns runnin on E
I know the law hate me dearly comin for me
We outlaws thugged out ns runnin on E
I know the law hate me dearly comin for me
We outlaws thugged out ns runnin on E
I know the law hate me dearly comin for me
We outlaws thugged out ns runnin on E
With the leaded Pac f the law
Carry steal cause I live in the n side of the law
Ridin foes cause I cant let hoes catch me slippin
Quick to blow and dispose if you block on hittin
Ridin high blazing kryptonite got a n dazing
Burpin and smurkin got on his knees before I grave em
Ride em look behind him I see him he slipped
At a stop light in a growin night this motherfen trick
Slide over so I can dip and put it in him
Damn I guess this motherfer know that I sent it
Hit the pedal now we high speeding
With the metal trying to make these motherfers die freezing
Up the way I seen him slow down
S I think Im gonna bust these hoes down
Caught them runnin on e it kind of funny to me
They know they was fin with me but they dumb to see
Open up fire watchin me spy when my shells split em
Plus all them tricks and the bes go to hell with em
F em they phony claimin they homies but the foes
Speakin on thug ns daily while we nailing they hoes
Explode boldly at my stage shows and formation
Words known to spray blaze as I raise my thug nation
Crooked thoughts cops get bought no longer caught
Did you cry when my girl died
Put out the hit politc ns worldwide grabbin my dick
Ill never learn take away the pain with sherm
Throwin gas on my enemies watchin them burn
Call my posse Im shootin up the casket take the body
Whip the corpse like a pinata and party
His last breath a straight lesson I posses like jewels
Stay thugged out keep it movin
If you a bad boy then you die
Westside outlawz when we ride get me high
They fed up when the rob me
Put another contract on Mobb DeepHow many brothers fell victim to the streets

And we still high assed out
Screamin thug till I die
Before I passed out
But now that your gone

But now ya gone
And all I got left are stinkin memories

Time to prepare to do fed time
Wont see parole
Imagine life as a convict

Plus with tha drama
Were lookin out for your babys mama
Taken risks while keepin cheap tricks from gettin on her
Life in tha hood

Remember gamin on dumb hotties at chill parties
Me and you
No true a two
While scheming on hits
And gettin tricks
That maybe we can slide into
But now you buried
Rest nigga
Cause I aint worried
Eyes blurry
Sayin goodbye at the cemetary
Tho memories fade
I got your name tated on my arm
So we both ball till my dying days
Before I say goodbye
Kato and Mental rest in peace
Thug till I die
How many brothers fell victim to the streets

But life goes on
Bury me smilin
With Gs in my pocket
Have a party at my funeral
Let every rapper rock it
Let tha hoes that I usta know
From way before
Kiss me from my head to my toe
Give me a paper and a pen
So I can write about my life of sin
A couple bottles of Gin
In case I dont get in
Tell all my people Im a Ridah
Nobody cries when we die
We outlaws
Let me ride
Until I get free
I live my life in tha fast lane
Got police chasen me
To my niggas from old blocks
From old crews
Niggas that guided me through
Back in tha old school
Pour out some liquor
Have a toast for tha homies
See we both gotta die
But ya chose to go before me
And brothas miss ya while your gone
You left your nigga on his own
How long we mourn
Life goes on
How many brothers fell victim to the streets
Rest in peace young nigga theres a Heaven for a G
Be a lie If I told ya that I never thought of death
My niggas we tha last ones left
But life goes onEvery night - a different town - I sing my song
I play and sing - pack my things and move along
A pretty face another place I never get to know
A one night stand another show
My guitar - a railroad car - a bus or plane
Chocolate bar - and there you are - the price of fame
If I could do what I want to Id stay and never go
A one night stand is all I know
I wish that I could be two people
Instead of bein on my own
I wish that I could be two people
And then Id never be alone
Photographs of where Ive been and all Ive done
In this whole world - is there a girl - no not one
Goodbye hello - Ive got to go - I hope you understand
A one night man is all I am
A one night stand a one night man
Doo doo doo
Goodbye hello - Ive got to go - I hope you understand
A one night man is all I am
A one night stand a one night man

A yo partner can you feel me
Why these fools tryin ta kill me
Its so hard to stay focused on my eyes and prize
But if I dont the Dogg wont survive
We ballin in my opinion eternal was wild wheel spinnin
One sip a minute is represented for five minutes
Two of the livest wanted dead or alive
We riders inventors because we aint quiet and watch the Gs ride
Two of Americas Most straight out the West Coast
Bow down fool this is Death Row
Been waitin way too long bust out the pen now its on
See man Snoop Dogg time to bone
Aint nuttin changed too down to hang I slang a bang with a rhyme
Me and the homey Pac trippin Death Row on knobs
Gon survive by Eastside of DPGs
Still creepin bump through the hood always involved in the streets
Westside Snoop Doggy Dogg homey did you forget who I was
The Big Homey to you there it is and there it was
Now take a look through the eyes of G
And just ride to the rhythm of a gangsta beat
All my homies tellin me aint no love for a real G
You straight cowards all you playa haters kill me
Throw up your hands if you feel me
We gettin dollars homey Holla If You Hear Me
Its one time for my comrades doin bad lockdown
Fresh out bust the top and bounce drop down

If the old school didnt pave the way
What more could I say I wouldnt be here today
If the old school didnt pave the way
What more could I say I wouldnt be here today
If the old school didnt pave the way
I remember Mr Magic Flash Grandmaster Caz
LL raising hell but that didnt last
Eric B Rakim was the shit to me
I flip to see a Doug E Fresh show with Ricky D
And Red Alert was puttin in work with Chuck Chill
Had my homies on the hill getting ill when shit was real
Went out to steal remember Raw with Daddy Kane
When De La Soul was puttin Potholes in the game
I cant explain how it was Whodini
Had me puffin on that buddha gettin buzzed cause there I was
Them block parties in the projects and on my block
You diggy dont stop sippin on that Private Stock
Through my speaker Queen Latifah and MC Lyte
Listen to Treach KRS to get me through the night
With T La Rock and Mantronix to Stetsasonic
Remember Push It was the bomb shit nuttin like the old school
What more could I say I wouldnt be here today
If the old school didnt pave the way
What more could I say I wouldnt be here today
If the old school didnt pave the way
What more could I say I wouldnt be here today
If the old school didnt pave the way
What more could I say I wouldnt be here today
If the old school didnt pave the way
What more could I say I wouldnt be here today
If the old school didnt pave the way
What more could I say I wouldnt be here today
If the old school didnt pave the way
I had Shell Toes and BVDs
A killer crease inside my Lees when I hit the streets
Im playing skelly ring to leavey or catch a kiss
Before the homies in my hood learned to smack a bitch I remember
Way back the weak weed they had
Too many seeds in the trey bag
Im on the train headin uptown freestyling
With some wild kids from Bucktown profiling
Cause the hoochies was starin thinking Why them niggas swearing
Im wondering if thats her hair I remember
Stickball pump the hoochies on the wall
Or taking leaks on the steps stinking up the hall
Through my childhood wild as a juvenile
A young nigga tryin to stay away from Rikers Isle
Me and my homies breakin nights tryin to keep it true
Out on the roof sipping ninety proof aint nuttin like the old school
What more could I say I wouldnt be here today
If the old school didnt pave the way
What more could I say I wouldnt be here today
If the old school didnt pave the way
What more could I say I wouldnt be here today
If the old school didnt pave the way
What more could I say I wouldnt be here today
If the old school didnt pave the way
What more could I say I wouldnt be here today
If the old school didnt pave the way
What more could I say I wouldnt be here today
If the old school didnt pave the way
Remember popping and locking to Kurtis Blow the name belts
And Scott LaRock the Super Ho back in Latin Quarters
When Slick Rick was spittin La-Di-Da-Di
Gaming the hoochies at the neighborhood block parties I remember
Breakdancing to Melle Mel
Jekyll and Hyde LL when he Rocks the Bells
Forget the TV about to hit the streets and do graffiti
Be careful dont let the transit cops see me
It aint nothing like the old school
What more could I say I wouldnt be here today
If the old school didnt pave the way
What more could I say I wouldnt be here today
If the old school didnt pave the way
What more could I say I wouldnt be here today
If the old school didnt pave the way
What more could I say I wouldnt be here today
If the old school didnt pave the way
What more could I say I wouldnt be here today
If the old school didnt pave the way
What more could I say I wouldnt be here today
If the old school didnt pave the wayThe nights grow cold
My search for gold is leading nowhere
Whichever lonely road I take
It seems to go nowhere
Its a fight to survive just until tomorrow
How can I display what I know Im worthy of
When they turn me away
The doors are closed to such as I
A boy from nowhere
But not to those who merely buy the right to go where
Theyll be met with respect not humiliation
A mans place on earth
I have come to realize is decided by birth
So whats the future
No matter where I go
I will still belong in Andalusia
Where we dont know where
The next pennys coming from
Somethings wrong
Im bound to Spain I wont remain
A boy from nowhere
There has to be a place for me
And I must go there
I dont fantasize unlike a million others
Who must bow and scrape
For my one means of escape
Is to flourish a cape
Ill fight all odds
And fight the Gods if they oppose me
I have to win I wont give in
No one who knows me would expect me to fail
For the want of trying
Not a man alive
Had to beg or steal or fight
More than me to survive
So whats the future
No matter where I go
I will still belong in Andalusia
Where good honest men grow weak
And the rich grow strong
Somethings wrong
Another dawn another boy
A boy from nowhere
My destiny will guarantee
And I must go there
Its a fight to survive just until tomorrow
One more mouth to feed
And the way things are round here
Thats the last thing they needEvery night - a different town - I sing my song
I play and sing - pack my things and move along
A pretty face another place I never get to know
A one night stand another show
My guitar - a railroad car - a bus or plane
Chocolate bar - and there you are - the price of fame
If I could do what I want to Id stay and never go
A one night stand is all I know
I wish that I could be two people
Instead of bein on my own
I wish that I could be two people
And then Id never be alone
Photographs of where Ive been and all Ive done
In this whole world - is there a girl - no not one
Goodbye hello - Ive got to go - I hope you understand
A one night man is all I am
A one night stand a one night man
Doo doo doo
Goodbye hello - Ive got to go - I hope you understand
A one night man is all I am
A one night stand a one night man
Doo doo doo

A favorite of my homies when we floss on our enemies
Witness as we creep to a low speed peep what a hoe need
Puff some mo weed funk ya dont need
Approachin hoochies with a passion been a long day

Comin up as a nigga in the cash game livin in the fast lane Im for real

Positions on the floor its like erotic ironic cause Im somewhat psychotic
Im hittin switches on bitches like I been fixed with hydraulics
Up and down like a roller coaster

Cause Ima rider in and out just like a robbery
Ill probably be a freak and let you get on top of me
Get her rockin these
Nights full of Alize a livin legend
You aint heard about these niggas play these Cali days
Delores Tucker youse a motherfucker
Instead of tryin to help a nigga you destroy a brother
Worse than the others Bill Clinton Mr Bob Dole
Youre too old to understand the way the game is told
Youre lame so I gotta hit you with the hot facts
Want some on lease Im makin millions niggas top that
They wanna censor me theyd rather see me in a cell
Livin in hell only a few of usll live to tell

How do you want it How does it feel
Comin up as a nigga in the cash game livin in the fast lane Im for real
How do you want it How do you feel
Comin up as a nigga in the cash game livin in the fast lane Im for real
Raised as a youth tell the truth I got the scoop on how to get a bulletproof
because I jumped from the roof before I was a teenager
mobile phone SkyPager game rules Im livin major my adversaries
Is lookin worried they paranoid of gettin buried
One of us gon see the cemetery
My only hope to survive if I wish to stay alive
Gettin high see the demons in my eyes before I die
I wanna live my life and ball make a couple million
And then Im chillin fade em all these taxes
Got me crossed up and people tryin to sue me
Media is in my business and they actin like they know me
