Wild Violet
The poignancy of things
A purple flower
The blossom of springs
and the light snow of winter
How they fall
The beauty of nature
A green leaf and
Autumn colors
The voice of the wind
The song of birds
A sad sea
A joyful sea
Mountains
Pebbles
A wild irisOut of the night has come the day
Out of the night our small earth
Our words drift away
Our words journey
To find those who will listen
We call into the distance Repeat 
Less than a pearl in the sea of stars
We are a lost island in the shadows
It may be our words become lost
It may be our words find nothing find no-one
We call into the distance Repeat Every time the rain comes down
I close my eyes and listen
I can hear the lonesome sound
Of the sky as it cries
Listen to the rain
Here it comes again
Hear it in the rain
Feel the touch of tears that fall
They wont fall forever
In the way the day will flow
All things come all things go
Listen to the rain the rain
Here it comes again again
Hear it in the rain the rain
Late at night I drift away
I can hear you calling
And my name is in the rain
Leaves on trees whispering
Deep blue seas mysteries
Even when this moment ends
Cant let go this feeling
Everything will come again
In the sound falling down
Of the sky as it cries
Hear my name in the rainIt may be the stars fallen from above
And you know love is with you when you rise
For night and day belong to love
City lights shine on the harbour
Night has fallen down
Through the darkness
And the shadow
I will still go on
Long long journey
Through the darkness
Long long way to go
But what are miles
Across the ocean
To the heart thats coming home
Where the road
Runs through the valley
Where the river flows
I will follow every highway
To the place I know
Long long journey
Through the darkness
Long long way to go
But what are miles
Across the ocean
To the heart thats coming home
Long long journey
Out of nowhere
Long long way to go
But what are sighs
And what is sadness
To the heart thats coming home
repeatWhere are you this moment
Only in my dreams
Youre missing but youre always
A heartbeat from me
Im lost now without you
I dont know where you are
I keep watching I keep hoping
But time keeps us apart
Is there a way I can find you
Is there a sign I should know
Is there a road I could follow
To bring you back home
Winter lies before me
Now youre so far away
In the darkness of my dreaming
The light of you will stay
If I could be close beside you
If I could be where you are
If I could reach out and touch you
And bring you back home
Is there a way I can find you
Is there a sign I should know
Is there a road I can follow
To bring you back home to meHow I remember sleepless nights
When we would read by candlelight
And on the windowpane outside
A new world made of snow
A million feathers falling down
A million stars that touch the ground
So many secrets to be found
Amid the falling snow
Maybe I am falling down
Tell me should I touch the ground
Maybe I wont make a sound
In the darkness all around
The silence of a winters night
Brings memories I hold inside
Remembering a blue moonlight
Upon the fallen snow
Maybe I am falling down
Tell me should I touch the ground
Maybe I wont make a sound
In the darkness all around
I close my window to the night
I leave the sky her tears of white
And all is lit by candlelight
Amid the falling snow
And all is lit by candlelight
Amid the falling snowIts only now when words are said
That break my heart in two
I wonder how you can endure
All Ive said all I say to you
How strong how brave how true of you
To bear the hurt I gave
I know it tears your heart in two
All Ive said all I say to you
After all the words are said
After all the dreams we made
Every one a precious one
Every one a summer sun
A moment lost forever gone
Can never be again
So know how much it means to me
All you said
All you gave
All your love to meSummer When the day is over
Theres a heart a little colder
Someone said goodbye
But you dont know why
Somewhere there is someone keeping
All the tears they have been weeping
Someone said goodbye
But you dont know why
Is there a reason
Why a broken heart begins to cry
Is there a reason
You were lost although you dont know why
Give me a reason
Why you never want to say goodbye
If theres a reason
I dont know why
Always looking for meaning
All the time you keep believing
But I dont know why
You wont say goodbye
Even when the sun is shining
You dont see the silver lining
But you dont know why
You wont say goodbye
Is there a reason
Why a broken dream can never fly
Is there a reason
You believe and you close your eyes
Give me a reason
Why you hide away so much inside
If theres a reason
I dont know why
Is there a reason
Why a broken heart begins to cry
Is there a reason
You were lost although you dont know why
Give me a reason
Why you never want to say goodbye
If theres a reason
I dont know why RepeatOur words go beyond the moon
Our words go into the shadows
The river sings the endlessness
We write of our journey through night
We write in our aloneness
We want to know the shape of eternity
Who knows the way it is
Who knows what time will not tell us
Mountains solitude and the moon
Until the journeys end
The river holds the lost road of the sky
The shape of eternity
Who knows the way it is
Who knows what time will not tell us
Where is the beginning
Where is the end
Why did we fall into days
Why are we calling out into the endlessness
Who knows the way it is
Who knows what time will not tell usFrom the City of Constellations
To the wanderer
And a Place of Rains
He journeys on
The City of hesitation and doubt
The Island if the house the color of the sea
The Plain of Mementoes
He journeys on to find his love
Th Valley of lost time
The City of End and Endlessness
The Isle of Revenents
He journeys on
The City of Solitudes
The City of distance from you
The City of Words of blue
And yellow and red and green
He journeys on to find his love
Where the road takes him through
The City of Sleep
The thinking that does not end in within him
Then he dreams
The road takes him
This man who is searching
It brings him
In silence through the night
Where the Cities that do not Exist exist
It brings him
In silence through the night
Close to the City of Realizations
It is here one finds the way
Mount Orison
The City of Days
The Tree of the lost
He journeys on
North of his love
A road through a valley of darkness
The islands that are not of this world
He journeys on to find his love
It is a long way through darkness
To the way of the eremite
To the eremite sings of the world and of
The journey of love which is not lost in eternity

Water shows the hidden heart

All the stars were fallen embers
Once when night seemed forever
I was with you
Once in the care of morning
In the air was all belonging
Once when that day was dawning
I was with you
How far we are from morning
How far we are
And the stars shining through the darkness
Falling in the air
Once as the night was leaving
Into us our dreams were weaving
Once all dreams were worth keeping
I was with youLazy old day
Rolling away
Dreaming the day away
Dont want to go
Now that Im in the flow
Crazy amazing day
One red balloon
Floats to the moon
Just let it fly away
I only know
That Im longing to go
Back to my lazy day
And how it sings and how it sighs
And how it never stays
And how it rings and how it cries
And how it sails away away awayDan y dwr tawelwch sydd

It weaves a web over mystery
All ravelled threads can rend apart
For hope has a place in the lovers heart
Hope has a place in a lovers heart
Whispering world a sigh of sighs
The ebb and the flow of the ocean tides
One breath one word may end or may start
A hope in a place of the lovers heart
Hope has a place in a lovers heart
Look to love you may dream
And if it should leave then give it wings
But if such a love is meant to be
Hope is home and the heart is free
Under the heavens we journey far
On roads of life were the wanderers
So let love rise so let love depart
Let hope have a place in the lovers heart
Hope has a place in a lovers heartI walk the maze of moments
But everywhere I turn to
Begins a new beginning
But never finds a finish
I walk to the horizon
And there I find another
It all seems so surprising
And then I find that I know
You go there youre gone forever
I go there Ill lose my way
If we stay here were not together
Anywhere is
The moon upon the ocean
Is swept around in motion
But without ever knowing
The reason for its flowing
In motion on the ocean
The moon still keeps on moving
The waves still keep on waving
And I still keep on going
You go there youre gone forever
I go there Ill lose my way
If we stay here were not together
Anywhere is
I wonder if the stars sign
The life that is to be mine
And would they let their light shine
Enough for me to follow
I look up to the heavens
But night has clouded over
No spark of constellation
No Vela no Orion
The shells upon the warm sands
Have taken from their own lands
The echo of their story
But all I hear are low sounds
As pillow words are weaving
And willow waves are leaving
But should I be believing
That I am only dreaming
You go there youre gone forever
I go there Ill lose my way
If we stay here were not together
Anywhere is
To leave the tread of all time
And let it make a dark line
In hopes that I can still find
The way back to the moment
I took the turn and turned to
Begin a new beginning
Still looking for the answer
I cannot find the finish
Its either this or that way
Its one way or the other
It should be one direction
It could be on reflection
The turn I have just taken
The turn that I was making
I might be just beginning
I might be near the endHere am I
Yet another goodbye
He says AdiÃÂ³s says AdiÃÂ³s

Your face before me
Though I dont know why
Thoughts disappearing like tears from the Moon
Waiting here as I sit by the stone
They came before me
Those men from the Sun
Signs from the heavens say I am the one
Now youre here I can see your light
This light that I must follow
You you may take my life away so far away
Now I know I must leave your spell
I want tomorrow
Now youre here I can see your light
This light that I must follow
You you may take my life away so far away
Now I know I must leave your spell
I want tomorrowI have been given
One moment from heaven
As I am walking
Surrounded by night
Stars high above me
Make a wish under moonlight
On my way home
I remember
Only good days
On my way home
I remember all the best days
Im on my way home
I can remember
Every new day
I move in silence
With each step taken
Snow falling round me
Like angels in flight
Far in the distance
Is my wish under moonlight
On my way home
I remember
Only good days
On my way home
I remember all the best days
Im on my way home
I can remember
Every new daySuddenly before my eyes
Hues of indigo arise
With them how my spirit sighs
Paint the sky with stars
Only night will ever know
Why the heavens never show
All the dreams there are to know
Paint the sky with stars
Who has placed the midnight sky
So a spirit has to fly
As the heavens seem so far now
Who will paint the midnight star
Night has brought to those who sleep
Only dreams they cannot keep
I have legends in the deep
Paint the sky with stars
Who has placed the midnight sky
So a spirit has to fly
As the heavens seem so far now
Who will paint the midnight star
Place a name upon the night
One to set your heart alight
And to make the darkness bright
Paint the sky with starsI dreamt I dwelt in marble halls
With vassals and serfs at my side
And of all who assembled within those walls
That I was the hope and the pride
I had riches all too great to count
And a high ancestral name
But I also dreamt which pleased me most
That you loved me still the same
That you loved me
You loved me still the same
That you loved me
You loved me still the same
I dreamt that suitors sought my hand
That knights upon bended knee
And with vows no maidens heart could withstand
They pledged their faith to me
And I dreamt that one of that noble host
Came forth my hand to claim
But I also dreamt which charmed me most
That you loved me still the same
That you loved me
You loved me still the same
That you loved me
You loved me still the sameI walk the maze of moments
But everywhere I turn to
Begins a new beginning
But never finds a finish
I walk to the horizon
And there I find another
It all seems so surprising
And then I find that I know

You go there youre gone forever

Are you near if rain should fall
Am I to believe
You will rise to calm the storm
For so great a treasure words will never do
Surely if this is
Promises are mine to give you
Mine to give
Here all too soon the day
Wish the moon to fall and alter tomorrow
I should know
Heaven has her way
Each one given memories to own
Angels all could be
Should you move both earth and sea
Angels I could feel
All those dark clouds disappearing
Even as I breathe
Comes an angel to their keep
Surely if this is
Promises are mine to give you
Mine to giveEurus

They say the sky high above
Is Caribbean blue
If every man says all he can
If every man is true
Do I believe the sky above

In December mornings
Cold is the cry that rings
From this far distant shore
Winter has come too late
Too close beside me
How can I chase away
All these fears deep inside
Ill wait the signs to come
Ill find a way
I will wait the time to come
Ill find a way home
My light shall be the moon
And my path - the ocean
My guide the morning star
As I sail home to you
Ill wait the signs to come
Ill find a way
I will wait the time to come
Ill find a way home
My light shall be the moon
And my path - the ocean
My guide the morning star
As I sail home to you
Who then can warm my soul
Who can quell my passion
Out of these dreams - a boat
I will sail home to youI have been given
One moment from heaven
As I am walking
Surrounded by night
Stars high above me
Make a wish under moonlight
On my way home
I remember
Only good days
On my way home
I remember all the best days
Im on my way home
I can remember
Every new day
I move in silence
With each step taken
Snow falling round me
Like angels in flight
Far in the distance
Is my wish under moonlight
On my way home
I remember
Only good days
On my way home
I remember all the best days
Im on my way home
I can remember

Hi-ri-U-O
Marbh go deoWho can tell me if we have heaven
Who can say the way it should be
Moonlight holly the Sappho Comet
Angels tears below a tree
You talk of the break of morning
As you view the new aurora
Cloud in crimson the key of heaven
One love carved in acajou
One told me of China Roses
One a thousand nights and one night
Earths last picture the end of evening
Hue of indigo and blue
A new moon leads me to
Woods of dreams and I follow
A new world waits for me
My dream my way
I know that if I have heaven
There is nothing to desire
Rain and river a world of wonder
May be paradise to me
I see the sun
I see the starsStrange how my heart beats
To find myself upon your shore
Strange how I still feel
My loss of comfort gone before
Cool waves wash over
And drift away with dreams of youth
So time is stolen
I cannot hold you long enough
And so this is where I should be now
Days and nights falling by
Days and nights falling by me
I know of a dream I should be holding
Days and nights falling by
Days and nights falling by me
Cool waves wash over
And drift away with reams of youth
So time is stolen
I cannot hold you long enough
Soft blue horizons
Reach far into my childhood days
As you are rising
To bring me my forgotten ways
Strange how I falter
To find Im standing in deep water
Strange how my heart beats
To find Im standing on your shoreEnglish
Listen to my heart
Sorrowful alas
I am lost without you
And your wife
The great love in your life
She guided me
Be with me always
Day and night
Chorus
Lamenting the great loneliness
The sorrowful tears
Asleep one in the quiet green grave
In a deep peace
There was happiness
But that departed
It was he who followed you
Your husband
The great love in your life
He guided me
Be with me always
Day and night

On the road you chose
To find out why the winds die
And where the stories go
All days come from one day
That much you must know
You cannot change whats over
But only where you go
One way leads to diamonds
One way leads to gold
Another leads you only
To everything youre told
In your heart you wonder
Which of these is true
The road that leads to nowhere
The road that leads to you
Will you find the answer
In all you say and do
Will you find the answer
In you
Each heart is a pilgrim
Each one wants to know

Above earths lamentations
I hear the real though far-off hymn
That hails a new creation
Through all the tumult and the strife
I hear its music ringing
It sounds an echo in my soul
How can I keep from singing
While though the tempest loudly roars
I hear the truth it liveth
And though the darkness round me close
Songs in the night it giveth
No storm can shake my inmost calm
While to that rock Im clinging
Since love is lord of heaven and earth
How can I keep from singing
When tyrants tremble in their fear
And hear their death knell ringing
When friends rejoice both far and near
How can I keep from singing
In prison cell and dungeon vile
Our thoughts to them are winging
When friends by shame are undefiled
How can I keep from singingMaidin is ts an lae

Pilgrim how you journey
On the road you chose
To find out where the winds die
And where the stories go
All days come from one day
That must you must know
You cannot change whats over
But only where you go
One way leads to diamonds
One way leads to gold
Another leads you only
To everything youre told
In your heart you wonder
Which of these is true
The road that leads to nowhere
The road that leads to you
Will you find the answer
In all you say and do
Will you find the answer
In you
Each heart is a pilgrim
Each one wants to know
The reason why the winds die
And where the stories go

Yo el otoÃo

He sido todo soy yo
Yo el verano
Yo el Ãbano
Soy la soÃadoraDawn breaks there is blue in the sky
Your face before me
Though I dont know why
Thoughts disappearing like tears from the Moon
Waiting here as I sit by the stone
They came before me
Those men from the Sun
Signs from the heavens say I am the one
Now youre here I can see your light
This light that I must follow
You you may take my life away so far away
Now I know I must leave your spell
I want tomorrow
Now youre here I can see your light
This light that I must follow
You you may take my life away so far away
Now I know I must leave your spell
I want tomorrowWhen the evening falls
And the daylight is fading
From within me calls
Could it be I am sleeping
For a moment I stray
Then it holds me completely
Close to home - I cannot say
Close to home feeling so far away
As I walk the room there before me a shadow
From another world where no other can follow
Carry me to my own to where I can cross over
Close to home - I cannot say
Close to home feeling so far away
Forever searching never right
I am lost in oceans of night
Forever hoping I can find memories
Those memories I left behind
Even though I leave will I go on believing
That this time is real - am I lost in this feeling
Like a child passing through
Never knowing the reason
I am home - I know the way
I am home - feeling oh so far awayWhen the warmth of the day becomes the night
Who could sleep beneath a strange moonlight
No guiding star
So far from home
Walked the way o promise to find but snow
Throughout the voice of the winds brings nothing more
Than low echoes
So far from home
Even from a child
A wish is not enough
For me for me the sky may fall
And even from a child
A dream is not enough
Could be could be the sky may fall
Could be could be the night ends all
No rains could weep as I have wept
To know a simple dream will not be kept
I am a child
So far from homeI walk the maze of moments
but everywhere I turn to
begins a new beginning
but never finds a finish
I walk to the horizon
and there I find another
it all seems so surprising
and then I find that I know
You go there youre gone forever
I go there Ill lose my way
if we stay here were not together
Anywhere is
The moon upon the ocean
is swept around in motion
but without ever knowing
the reason for its flowing
in motion on the ocean
the moon still keeps on moving
the waves still keep on waving
and I still keep on going
You go there youre gone forever
I go there Ill lose my way
if we stay here were not together
Anywhere is
I wonder if the stars sign
the life that is to be mine
and would they let their light shine
enough for me to follow
I look up to the heavens
but night has clouded over
no spark of constellation
no Vela no Orion
The shells upon the warm sands
have taken from their own lands
the echo of their story
but all I hear are low sounds
as pillow words are weaving
and willow waves are leaving
but should I be believing
that I am only dreaming
You go there youre gone forever
I go there Ill lose my way
if we stay here were not together
Anywhere is
To leave the thread of all time
and let it make a dark line
in hopes that I can still find
the way back to the moment
I took the turn and turned to
begin a new beginning
still looking for the answer
I cannot find the finish
its either this or that way
its one way or the other
it should be one direction
it could be on reflection
the turn I have just taken
the turn that I was making
I might be just beginning
I might be near the endOne day one night one moment
My dreams could be tomorrow
One step one fall one falter
East or west
Over earth or by ocean
One way to be my journey
This way could be my
Book of days
No day no night no moment
Can hold me back from trying
Ill flag Ill fall Ill falter
Ill find my day maybe
Far and away
Far and away
One day one night one moment
With a dream to be living
One step one fall one falter

Look above them
Only they can see
Where the clouds are going
Only to discover
Dust and sunlight
Ever make the sky so blue
Afternoon is hazy
River flowing
All around the sounds
Moving closer to them
Telling them the story
Told by Flora
Dreams they never knew
Silver willows
Tears from Persia
Those who come
From a far-off island
Winter Chanterelle lies
Under cover
Glory-of-the-sun in blue
Some they know as passion
Some as freedom
Some they know as love
And the way it leaves them
Summer snowflake

Everywhere is whispering

The diamonds on the water
Are falling from the sun
The diamonds on the water

You held me high you held me high
And all those years you guided me
So I could find my way
How long your love had sheltered me
You held me high you held me high
A harbour holding back the sea
So I could find my way
So let me give this dream to you
Upon another shore
So let me give this dream to you
Each night and ever more
Yet only time keeps us apart
You held me high you held me high
Youre in the shadows of my heart
So I can find my way
You held me high you held me high
So let me give this dream to you
Upon another shore
So let me give this dream to you
Each night and ever more
A thousand dreams you gave to me

Dont hide away in solitude

Let tears become a soft rain
Why do you hide the loss inside
The love you feel is in your eyes
Why do you go upon this road
When you could find your way homeA silver hue on wings of blue
As all around me shadows dance in light
Sun is high above
And winds are still enough
And all I want to do is stay
And everywhere the blues
Are moving in the air
I see them in their flight
Sun is high above
And winds are still enough
And all I want to do is stay
For seven days
They make the sky
Look down upon them
As they go their way
Sun is high above
And winds are still enough
And all I want to do is stay
For seven nights
They wait the moment
For the morning light to come again
Sun is high above
And winds are still enough
And all I want to do is stay
And one by one
They wander one by one
Meander never go astray
Sun is high above
And winds are still enough
And all I want to do is stay
And so I stand and gaze
And so I watch the maze of blues depart the day
Sun is high above
And winds are still enough
And one by one they fly away
Sun is high above
And winds are still enough
And one by one they fly away
Sun is high above
And winds are still enough
And one by one they fly awaySancta Maria

To find you walk away
And even when I whisper

To steal the words I say
I could fall and keep on falling
I could call and keep on calling
Wonder why this love is over
Wonder why its not forever
Even in the silence
I hear my heart
Its still a part of you
And even in the morning
When light has come
I dont know what to do
So high so low I could fall and keep on falling
I could call and keep on calling
Wonder why this love is over
Wonder why its not forever
So high so low I could fall and keep on falling

far from the crowds
we wold wander together
walking for miles
with the night still before us
and day passing by
I always remeber your smile
Cool in the evening
warm in the sun
the clouds moving slowly
time was undone
yet the days fell before us
and the nights rolled on by
I always remember your smile
Every step and each moment
were all so worthwhile
I always remember your smile
I always remember your smile
And its strange how for a moment
the heavens were mine
I always remember your smile
Each one has a journey
thats how it goes
sometimes were together
sometimes aloneAh ah ah ah ah ah ah ah

Night passes by
Taking the stars
So far away

Summer
The sun and the sand
Autumn
The shape of yellow leaves falling
A lost time far in the distance
Winter
The sky sang snow
Written into the night
A world of stars
A lost time far in the distance
Now is the season of water
The island the cities the darkness
Through time this became our world
But our quest is not yet over
Now is the season of the moon
Soft breezes whispering

Now I walk alone
Youre no longer here
The days turn to years
I could never say goodbye
To the sadness in my eyes
You know you are in my heart
But the miles keep us apart
Time moves slow
In the falling rain
I still dream of you
And whisper your name
Will I see you once again
I could never say goodbye
To the sadness in my eyes
You know you are in my heart
But the miles keep us apartMemories we share together
Moments no one else can know
I will keep them close to me
Never let them go
Once you filled my hands with roses
Then you gave your heart to me
When a kiss had followed this
Love was meant to be
Time goes by and the snow is drifting
Slowly in the sky cold cold night
As you lie beside me I can hear your heartbeat
You have lost yourself in dreaming
I have lost myself in you
Now we lie beneath the sky
Stars and midnight blue
Stars and midnight blueSomewhere
In a winter night
The angels
Begin their flight
Dark skies
With miles to go
No footsteps
To be lost in snow
They fly to you
Oh newborn king
They fly to you
Oh angels sing
One is sorrow
One is peace
One will come
To give you sleep
One is comfort
One is grief
One will take
The tears you weep
New star
In a midnight sky
In heaven
All the angels fly
Soft wings so true
And all things
They will give to you
Somewhere
In a winter night

Begin their flight

It fills the night with kisses
Have you seen the bright blue star
It fills your heart with wishes
Have you seen the candlelight
It shines from every window
Have you seen the moon above
It lights the sky in silver
Green is in the mistletoe
And red is in the holly
Silver in the stars above
That shine on everybody
Gold is in the candlelight
And crimson in the embers
White is in the winter night
That everyone remembers
Have you heard the boys outside
When all the girls are skating
Have you heard their sweet hearts cry
For all this time theyre waiting
Green is in the mistletoe
And red is in the holly
Silver in the stars above
That shine on everybody
Gold is in the candlelight
And crimson in the embers
White is in the winter night
That everyone remembers
Have you seen the children playing
Tiny hands are frozen
Have you seen them hurry home
When suddenly its snowing
Green is in the mistletoe
And red is in the holly
Silver in the stars above
That shine on everybody
Gold is in the candlelight
And crimson in the embers
White is in the winter night
That everyone remembers
Have you heard that bells are ringing
Ringing out their story
Have you heard the choir singing
Glory glory gloryCome see high above
Come see high in the heavens
A new star shining bright
Out of the darkness comes a light
Come here in a child
Come here bells that are ringing
And for some distant shore
Sounds of a journey echo on
This is the night
They say
Everyone wants a dream
This is the night
They say
Nothing is as it seems
Come see close your eyes
Come see give me your sorrow
And I keep watch for you
Until the dawn is breaking through
Until the morning wakens you
Come dream through the night
Come dream and then tomorrow
Theyll see who what will know
Dreams are more precious than gold
Dreams are more precious than gold
Dreams are more precious than goldOne toy soldier stands alone
With his drum down by his side
One toy soldier on his own
With his drum to keep the time
He keeps the beet of marching feet
He keeps the beat so true
Hes one small toy for one small boy
But his heart is oh so blue
Who can mend my broken drum
Will it be as good as new
I must play when morning comes
If I dont what shall I do
He keeps the beat of marching feet
He keeps the beat inside
While children sleep he dreams so deep
Theres a secret he must hide
For he keeps the beat of marching feet
He keeps the beat so true
He wants to sing and hopes to bring
Happy Christmas day to you
He keeps the beat of marching feet
He keeps the beat inside
Someone has come to mend his drum
Now his heart lights up with pride
So he keeps the beat of marching feet
He keeps the beat so true
When morning comes he plays his drum
Happy Christmas Day to you
Happy Christmas Day to you
Happy Christmas Day to you
Happy Christmas Day to youCity streets passing by
Underneath stormy skies
Neon signs in the night

Was shining
In moonlight
And everywhere around us
The silence
Of midnight
And we had gathered snowflakes
Remember
The soft light
Of starlight on snow
Oooh remember this
For no one knows
The way love goes
Oooh remember this
For no one knows
The way life goes
We walked the road together
One last time
By moonlight
As underneath the heavens
The slow chimes
At midnight
But nothing is forever
Not even
The starlight
At midnight
Not even
The moonlight
Oooh remember this
For no one knows
The way love goes
Oooh remember this

And our voices will blend
With the loved ones whove gone on before
Never grow old

In the land where well never grow oldThis world is not my home Im just a-passing through
My treasures are layed up somewhere beyond the blue
The angels beacon me through heavens open door
And I cant feel at home in this world anymore
chorus
Oh Lord You know I have no friend but you
If Heavens not my home Oh Lord what would I do
Angels have taken me to Heavens open door
And I cant feel at home in this world anymore
Over in glory land there is no dying there
The saints are shouting Victry and singing everywhere
I hear the voice of Nell that I have heard before
And I cant feel at home in this world anymoreWoke up this morning and I could not keep from crying
Woke up this morning and I could not keep from crying
My good gal left me with a troubling mind
Oh just look where that evening sun has gone
Oh just look where that evening sun has gone
Gone down behind the mountain and it wont be back till morn
Oh hand me that long distance phone
Oh hand me that long distance phone
Gonna talk to my honey all night long
Oh take me back and try me one more time
Oh take me back and try me one more time
And if I dont do then send me down the lineIm going to take a trip in that old gospel ship
Im a-going far beyond the sky
Im gonna shout and sing til heaven rings
When I hid this world goodbye
I have good news to bring and that is why I sing
All my joys with you Ill share
Im going to take a trip in that old gospel ship
And go sailing through the air
I can scarcely wait I know I wont be late
Ill spend my time in prayer
And when the ship comes in Ill leave this world of sin
And go sailing through the air
If you are ashamed of me you ought not to be
Yes youd better have a care
If too much fault you find you will sure be left behind
While Im sailing through the airJust let me tell you how a liar will do
Hes always coming with something new
Hell steal your heart with false pretense
Making out like hes your bosom friend
If you dont want to get in trouble
If you dont want to get in trouble
If you dont want to get in trouble
Better let that liar alone
When a liar takes the notion to bend the truth
Hell lay around his neighbors and get the news
And nearly every day when you look out
You can see that liar coming to your house
If you dont want to get in trouble
If you dont want to get in trouble
If you dont want to get in trouble
Better let that liar alone
Hell tell you such a lie itll surprise your mind
Hell mix a little truth for to make it shine
When he gets his business fixed just right
Then that liars going to cause a fight
If you dont want to get in trouble
If you dont want to get in trouble
If you dont want to get in trouble
Better let that liar alone
He studies up a lie hell tell it so smooth
Youll think absolutely that it must be true
And hell urge you out for to trace the tale
And if you dont mind youll be put in jail
If you dont want to get in trouble
If you dont want to get in trouble
If you dont want to get in trouble
Better let that liar alone
When everythings in perfect peace
Then comes that liar with his deceit
A hypocrite liar both keeps up a fuss
Theyre both very bad but a liars the worse
If you dont want to get in trouble
If you dont want to get in trouble
If you dont want to get in trouble
Better let that liar aloneIve got the lonesome homesick blues
Ive got them bad babe down in my shoes
I left someone there that I might lose
Thats why Ive got these old homesick blues
It makes me homesick to hear your name
And hold you dear in my arms again
Im a gonna ride that old lonesome train
To the one I left back in Maces Spring
You told me once dear you loved me so
And its on my mind dear every where I go
Ill soon be knowing if it is so
Or has your love for me grown cold
Oh listen to that old lonesome train
Its a gonna carry me back again
To the one that told me their love was true
Ill spend the rest of my days with youFrom the great Atlantic ocean to the wide Pacific shore
She climbs a flowery mountains oer the hills and by the shore
Shes mighty tall and handsome shes known quite well by all
Shes a regular combination on the Wabash Cannonball
Chorus
Listen to the jingle the rumble and the roar
As she glides along the woodland oer the hills and by the shore
Hear the mighty rush of the engine hear those lonesome hoboes call
Traveling through the jungle on the Wabash Cannonball
Well she came down from Birmingham one cold December day
As she pulled into the station you could hear all the people say
Shes from Tennessee shes long and shes tall
She came down from Birmingham on the Wabash Cannonball
Chorus
Heres to daddy Claxton may his name forever stand
And always be remembered in the courts throughout the land
His earthly race is over and the curtains round him fall
Well carry him home to Dixie on the Wabash Cannonball
ChorusWhen death shall close these eye lids
And this heart shall cease to beat
And they lay me down to rest
In some flowery bound retreat
Will you miss me
Miss me when Im gone
Will you miss me
Miss me when Im gone
Will you miss me
Miss me when Im gone
Will you miss me when Im gone
Perhaps youll plant a flower
On my poor unworthy grave
Come and sit along beside me
When the roses nod and wave
Will you miss me
Miss me when Im gone
Will you miss me
Miss me when Im gone
Will you miss me
Miss me when Im gone
Will you miss me when Im gone
One sweet thought my soul shall cherish
When this fleeting life has flown
This sweet thought will cheer when dying
Will you miss me when Im gone
When these lips shall never more
Press a kiss upon thy brow
But lie cold and still in death
Will you love me then as now
Will you miss me
Miss me when Im gone
Will you miss me
Miss me when Im gone
Will you miss me
Miss me when Im gone
Will you miss me when Im goneThere was a little ship and she sailed upon the sea
And she went by the name of the Merry Golden Tree
And she sailed upon the low and lonesome low
And she sailed upon the lonesome sea
There was a little sailor unto his captain said
Oh captain captain whatll you give to me
If I sink them in the low and lonesome low
If I sink them in the lonesome sea
Two hundred dollars I will give unto thee
And my oldest daughter Ill wed unto you
If you sink them in the low and lonesome low
If you sink them in the lonesome sea
He bowed upon his breast and away swim he
Till he came the ship of the Turkish Reveille
As she sailed upon the low and lonesome low
As she sailed upon the lonesome sea
If it wasnt for the love of your daughter and your men
I would do unto you as I did unto them
I would sink you in the low and lonesome low
I would sink you in the lonesome sea
He bowed his head and down sank he
Farewell farewell to the Merry Golden Tree
For Im sinking in the low and lonesome low
For Im sinking in the lonesome seaIf I could be there
Id be there tonight comforting you
This road Im on is so far away
Too far away
If God would grant me wings to fly
Id be in your arms by and by
If I could be there
Id be there tonight comforting you
If I could be there
Id look in your eyes and say I love you
These hills and highways
Between us now keep us apart
If God would grant me wings to fly
Id be in your arms by and by
If I could be there
Id look in your eyes and say I love you
If I could be there
I wouldnt have this pain in my heart
Tomorrow Ill wake up with joy for the day
Joy for the day
If God would grant me wings to fly
Id be in your arms by and by
If I could be there
I wouldnt have this pain in my heart
If I could be thereI take the chance to lose my soul my life my pride
I take the chance to be with you
Ive tried to live my life the best I can
Ive prayed Id never cheat to heed my hearts command
But dear you know to one Ive been untrue
I wonder if you think Id do the same by you
I take the chance of causing you to doubt my love
I take the chance to be with you
I know its wrong for us to steal a kiss
And when you hold me in your arms I cant resist
I have a home and someone kind and true
I know Id lose it all if I was seen with you
I take the chance to lose my soul my life my pride
I take the chance to be with youWell I thought I had seen good looking men in my time
That was before I met you
And I never saw one that I wanted for mine But that was before I met you
Chorus
Well I thought I was swinging the world by the tail
I thought I could never be blue
I thought Id been kissed
And I thought Id been loved
But that was before I met you
Well I wanted to ramble and always be free
That was before I met you
And I said that nobody could ever hold me
But that was before I met you
Repeat Chorus
Well I thought I was swinging the world by the tail
I thought I could never be blue
I thought Id been kissed
And I thought Id been loved
But that was before I met you
I thought Id been kissed
And I thought Id been loved
But that was before I met you
Darling that was before I met youWhen my blue moon turns to gold again
When my rainbow turns the clouds away
When my blue moon turns to gold again
Youll be back within my arms to stay
When the memories that linger in our hearts
Memories that make my heart cold
However some day theyll live again sweetheart
And my blue moon again will turn to gold
When my blue moon turns to gold again
When my rainbow turns the clouds away
When my blue moon turns to gold again
Youll be back within my arms to stay
When the memories that linger in our hearts
Memories that make my heart cold
However some day theyll live again sweetheart
And my blue moon again will turn to goldBeneath her clothes her heart is breaking
Spends her mornings making lines
Though her pain is real and aching
All she owns are borrowed lines
Doesnt know which side to be on
Though shes trying every door
Only needs the floor she sleeps on
All she asks is a little more time
Bobbies gone to California
I wont see her anymore
Bobbies gone to California
Like she did the year before
And the year before
The day she left her shirt was clinging
To her back wet with rain
I watched her leave heard her singing
A song she wrote when Christmas came
Bobbies young but getting older
The face she shows is not her own
Winters near its getting colder
Californias called her home again
Bobbies gone to California
I wont see her anymore
Bobbies gone to California
Like she did the year before
And the year before
The mirror gives back no reflection
Of shadow she will not see
It understands she needs protection
Of what she swears she has to be
Bobbies nights are empty tables
Hold her til shes made to leave
Bobbies dreams are empty fables
She makes herself believe
To be free
Sometimes she cried because of visions
Of what she loved had all been sold
Theres not much left no one to listen
To the echoes that she holds
How could I tell her when shes fading
She run out of a place to be
There will be no one waiting
For the poetry of her soul
I wont see her anymore
Bobbies gone to California
Like she did the year before
And the year beforeWalk through this world with me
Go where I go
Share all my dreams with me
I need you so
In life we search
And some of us find
Ive looked for you
A long long time
And now that Ive found you
New horizons I see
Come take my hand and
Walk through this world with me
Walk through this world with me
Go where I go
Share all my dreams with me
Ive searched for you so
And now that Ive found you
New horizons I see
Come take my hand and
Walk through this world with me
Come take my hand and
Walk through this world with meYouve got me under your spell again
Saying those things again
Making me believe that youre just mine
Youve got me dreaming those dreams again
Thinking those things again
Ive got to take you back just one more time
Well I swore that the last time you let me down
That I wouldnt see you if you came around
But I cant tell my heart whats right or wrong
And Ive been so lonely dear since youve been gone
Youve got me under your spell again
Saying those things again
Making me believe that youre just mine
Youve got me dreaming those dreams again
Thinking those things again
Ive got to take you back just one more time
Well everybody tells me Lord that Im a fool
That I should have never put my faith in you
And way down deep inside I guess I know its true
But no one else can make me feel the way you doCome sit by my side little darlin
Come lay your cool hand on my brow
And promise me that you will
Never be nobodys darlin but mine
Be nobodys darlin but mine
Love be honest be faithful be kind
And promise me that you will
Never be nobodys darlin but mine
Youre as sweet as the flowers of springtime
Youre as pure as the dew from the rose
I had rather be somebodys darlin
Than a poor boy that nobody knows
Be nobodys darlin but mine loveLast night I thought I felt your arms around me
But woke to find that it was just a dream
Though youre gone I find you constantly surround me
Ohh just something else that keeps your memory green
I go out and try my hand at startin over
But find it hard to break the old routine
Cause I wind up seein you in each new lover
Ohh just something else that keeps your memory green
Time should be a cure for a heartache
A healing melody for shattered dreams
But I swear sometimes I hear you say you love me
Ohh just something else that keeps your memory green
Time should be a cure for a heartache
A healing melody for shattered dreams
Oh but I swear sometimes I hear you say you love me
Ohh just something else that keeps your memory green
Just something else that keeps your memory greenI see a million old memories each day
That remind me of what used to be
My aching heart tells me they are here to stay
Since you made a memory of me
I tossed and I turned night after night
Those memories just wont let me sleep
The flame in my heart is still burning bright
Though you made a memory of me
I passed by the house we once loved in
For a glimpse of what I thought was our dream
But these days I find the dream was all mine
Cause you made a memory of me
I passed by the house we once loved in
For a glimpse of what I thought was our dream
But these days I find the dream was all mine
Cause you made a memory of meIll never love another now that youve gone away
And left me here to grieve dear all alone
It seems I always lose my dear no matter how I try
Ill never love another until the day I die
Ill never love another now that youve proved untrue
Without your lovin darling what am I to do
I spend my life for you dear now youve left me blue
Ill never love another if I cant have you
My castles now have tumbled that we have built for two
And all my dreams have vanished dear with you
Ill find no one to take your place so Ill now even try
Ill never love another until the day I die
Ill never love another
Now you dont know my heartaches that you caused me to bear
Or you would not have gone away from me
Ill have to live my life alone and think of days gone by
Ill never love another until the day I die
Ill never love anotherKeep the fire burning in your eyes
Pay attention to the open sky
Youll never know what will be coming down
I dont remember losing track of you
Youre always dancing in and out of view
I must have thought you would always be around
Always keeping things real by playing the clown
Now youre nowhere to be found
I dont know what happens when people die
Cant seem to grasp it as hard as I try
Its like a song I can hear playing right in my ear
But I cant sing I cant help listening
I cant help feeling stupid standing around
Crying is the easier down
Cause I know that you would rather wed be dancing
Dancing our sorrow away
No matter what fate throws in your way
Just do the steps that youve been shown
By everyone youve ever known
Until the dance becomes your very own
No matter how close to yours
Anothers steps have grown
In the end there is one dance youll do alone
Keep a fire for the human race
Let your prayers go drifting into space
Youll never know what will be coming down
Perhaps a better world is drawing near
Just as easy it could all disappear
Along with whatever meaning you might have found
Dont let the uncertainty turn you around
Go on and make a joyful sound
Into a dancer you have grown
From a seed somebody else has thrown
Go on ahead and throw some seeds of your own
And somewhere between the time you arrive
The time you go may lie a reason you were alive
But youll never knowYoull never be the sun turning in the sky
And you wont be the moon above us on a moonlit night
And you wont be the stars in heaven although they burn so bright
But even on the deepest ocean you will be the light
You may not always shine as you go barefoot over stone
You might be so long together or you might walk alone
And you wont find that love comes easy but that love is always right
So even when the dark clouds gather you will be the light
And if you lose the part inside
When loves turns round on you leaving the past behind
Is knowing youll do like you always do holding you blind keeping you true
guitar
Youll never be the sun
You will be the light you will be the lightmy drifiting memory goes back to the spring of forty-three
when i was just a child in mamas arms
my daddy plowed the ground and prayed someday we might leave this rundown mortgaged oklahoma farm
and then one night i heard my daddy saying to my mama
that hed finall saved enough to go
californa was his dream of paradise
fore he had seen pictures in magazines
that told him so
californa cottonfields
where labor camps are filled with worried men with broken dreams
californa cottonfields
as close to welath as daddy ever came
well almost everything we had was sold or left behind
from my daddys plow to the fruit that mama canned
and some folks came to say farewell and see what all we had to sell
and some just came to shake my daddys hand
well the Model A was loaded down and californa bound
and a change of luck was just four days away
but the only change that i remember seeing for my daddy
was when his dark hair turned to silver gray
repeat chours twoxValerie By Patti Scialfa
Valerie
To the east and factories stand like fire breathing dragons against the sky
And from their throats a scarlet river burns itself into smoky lullabies
Over neon and fluorescent skies
VALERIE CAN YOU HEAR THOSE ENGINES DRONE
I WANTED TO GO TO MEXICO BUT IM STRANDED HERE ALONE
AND ONCE I KNEW A TRUE LOVE ITS BEEN THREE YEARS SINCE HES GONE
AND IF I COULD GET THAT FEELING BACK ID GIVE UP EVERYTHING I OWN
Sixteen days since I left corona and I traveled to this carnival town near Alberndeel
And I rode the coaster there on the fairground Twisted backbone of a beast that never heals And I left some skin on fortunes wheel
VALERIE CAN YOU HEAR THOSE ENGINES DRONE
I WANTED TO GO TO MEXICO BUT IM STRANDED HERE ALONE
AND ONCE I KNEW A TRUE LOVE ITS BEEN THREE YEARS SINCE HES GONE
AND IF I COULD GET THAT FEELING BACK ID GIVE UP EVERYTHING I OWN
Everythings in slow motion now in this little border town
Ive come so close from so far
Just to hide behind these windows here from the world outside
I watch those cars and trucks raise trails of dust down the road as they pass by
VALERIE CAN YOU HEAR THOSE ENGINES DRONE
I WANTED TO GO TO MEXICO BUT IM STRANDED HERE ALONE
AND ONCE I KNEW A TRUE LOVE ITS BEEN THREE YEARS SINCE HES GONE
AND IF I COULD GET THAT FEELING BACK ID GIVE UP EVERYTHING I OWNOh my darling
I have searched the desert and the sky
Just to find you
And take the mourning from my eyes
When I lost you
I suffered and you were sanctified
We are all born to live we are all bound to die
Swing down sweet chariot
The flesh will fall and the bones will rot
But from my sorrow youll carry me not
My heart is bound my soul is chained
To the rock
Rock of ages cleft for me
I swung down my hammer out in Joshua Tree
It rang on the mountain and rolled to the sea
And it will ring from the rock
Oh my children
Sorrow shall come to each of us
All our trials
Will soon lay buried in the dust
Long forgotten
But quick as silver turns to rust
Love is found when the heart is lostYou feel the thirst
But none can make you drink
The answers waiting for you here but
Its not what you think
It wont steal your soul or leave you blind
It was just a cup of kindness all the time
And when Mother Mary finally comes to cal
She could pass right through your heart
And leave no trace at all
While you were reaching for
The sacred and divine
She was standing right beside you
All the time
And the emptiness
You cant seem to fill
Beauty fades and pleasures cannot
Take away the chili
And the glamor lures you down into a lie
O but the cup of kindness
Never will run dry
You hear the vandals
Howlin down your walls
And arm yourself against the ones
Who want to see you fall
Till some Holy Grail reveals
The grand design
Well it was in a cup of kindness
All the timeOh sometimes I go walkin through fields where we walked
Long ago in the sweet used to be
And the flowers still grow but they dont smell as sweet
As they did when you picked them for me
And when I think of you and the love we once knew
How I wish we could go back in time
Do you ever think back on old memries like that or do I ever cross your mind
fiddle - mandolin
Do you ever wake up lonely in the middle of the night
Cause you miss me do you darling
Oh and do your memries ever take you back into another place in time
And do you ever miss the feelings and the love we shared
When you were with me tell me darling or do I ever cross your mind
guitar
Oh how often I wish that again I could kiss your sweet lips like I did long ago
And how often I long for those two lovin arms that once held me so gentle and close
And when I think of you and the love we once knew
How I wish we could go back in time
Do you ever recall these old memries at all or do I ever cross your mind
Tell me darling do I ever cross your mindYou wore out a brand new trunk
Packin and unpackin all your junk
Your mamas mad she done got peeved
Youre gonna change or Im gonna leave
Well this aint right and that is wrong
You just keep naggin all the day long
Its gonna stop I dont mean please
Now youre gonna change or Im gonna leave
The way to keep a woman happy and her do whats right
Is love her every mornin and do the same at night
Your mamas mad she done got peeved
Youre gonna change or Im a-gonna leave
Every time you get mad
You pack your rags and go back to what you had
You tell her lies she dont believe
Youre gonna change or Im gonna leave
Youre gonna change your way of livin
Change the things you do
Stop doin all the things that you aughten too
Your mamas mad she done got peeved
Youre gonna change or Im a-gonna leave
Youre gonna change or Im a-gonna leaveThis is how I learned it from a Time-Life Album in about one thousand, nine hundred and fifty-eight
Theres a little rosewood casket
Lying on a marble stand
And a packet of old love letters
Written by my true loves hand
Go and bring them to me sister
Read them oer for me tonight
I have often tried but I could not
For the tears that filled my eyes I did not know this verse--Thanks
Last Sunday I saw him walkin
With a lady by his side
And I thought I heard him tell her
He would never be his bride
When Im dead and in my coffin
And my shrouds around me bound
And my narrow grave is ready
In some lonely churchyard ground
Take his letters and his locket
Place together oare my heart
But the golden ring he gave me
From my finger never partFive-lane highway danger zone
SUV and a speaker phone
You need that chrome to get you home
Doin time in Babyion
Cluster mansion on the hill
Another day in Pleasantville
You dont like it take a pill
Doinone time in Babyion
In the land of the proud and free
You can sell your soul and your dignity
For fifteen minutes on TV
Doin time in Babyion
So suck the fat cut the bone
Fill it up with silicone
Everybody must get cloned
Doin time in Babyion
Little Boy Blue come blow your horn
The crows are in the corn
The morning sky is red and falling down
The pipers at the till
Hes coming for the kill
Luring all our children underground in Babyion
We came frorm apple pie and mom
through Civil Rights and Ban the Bomb
To Watergate and Vietnam Hard times in Babyion
Rallied round the megaphone
Gave it up just got stoned
Now its Prada Gucci and Perron
Doin time in Babyion
Get results get em fast
Were ready if you got the cash
Someone else will be laughin last
Doin time in Babyion
So put that conscience on the shelf
Keep the best stuff for yourself
Let the rest fight over what is left
Doin time in Babyion
Little Boy Blue come blow your horn
The crows are in the corn
The morning sky is red and falling down
Let your song of healing spark
A way out of this dark
Lead us to a higher and a holy groundChorus
Ive been higher than the high sierra
Lower than death valley must be
Ive been right mostly wrong
Wrong about you right about me
The way I feel cant explain
So much passion turned to pain
The sun still shines most of the time
Did you know the sun shines when it rains
Chorus
Ive been cussed and Ive been praised
And Ive been nothing these days
But Ill come back time will see
If Im wrong about you right about meDont bother sittin at my table
Just because Im on my own
Yes Im a woman and Im lonely
But that dont mean I cant be strong
Once again hes not beside me
And tonight he wont be coming home
So I just need a place to miss my baby
When he goes out to do me wrong
Tonight I want to do some drinkin
I came to listen to the band
Yes Im as good as what youre thinkin
But I dont want to hold your hand
And I know Im lookin lonely
But theres nothing here I want to find
Its just the way of a woman
When she goes out to walk the line
Every nights a little longer
Than the one that came before
But when I hear them sing a sad song
I know just what Im cryin for
I dont want to stay home waitin
Dont have to wonder where hes been
Hell be someone elses baby
Before hes in my arms again
Tonight I want to do some drinkin
I came to listen to the band
Yes Im as good as what youre thinkin
But I dont want to hold your hand
And I know Im lookin lonely
But theres nothing here I want to find
Its just the way of a woman
When she goes out to walk the line
Its just the way of a woman
When she goes out to walk the line
Dont bother sittin at my tableWritten by Jimmie Rodgers

Last night as I lay on the boxcar
Just waiting for a train to pass by
What will become of the hobo
Whenever his time comes to die
Theres a Master up yonder in heaven
Got a place that we might call our home
Will we have to work for a living
Or can we continue to roam
Will there be any freight trains in heaven
Any boxcars in which we might hide
Will there be any tough cops or brakemen
Will they tell us that we cannot ride
Will the hobo chum with the rich man
Will we always have money to spare
Will they have respect for the hobo
In that land that lies hidden up there
Will there be any freight trains in heaven
Any boxcars in which we might hide
Will there be any tough cops or brakemen
Will they tell us that we cannot ride
Will the hobo chum with the rich man
Will we always have money to spare
Will they have respect for the hobo
In that land that lies hidden up thereYoure running wild
How long can this go on
Youre leaving me alone
Stop running wild
Youre always gone
My love youll never change
Its more than I can bear
Stop running wild
Youll settle down someday
And find Ive gone away
Youll think of what youve done
While running wild
You cant go home
Youll have to change your ways
Youll have to go or stay
Stop running wildI think I love him think I knew the first time
He called my name and said You are my sunshine
I think I love him think I knew the hour
He held me close and said you are my flowerAnd so you have come back to me and say the old loves growing yet
Youve tried through all these weary years youve tried too vainly to forget
Oh no I cannot take your hand God never gives is back our youth
The loving heart you slighted then was yours my friend in perfect truth

Come close and let me see your face your raven hair is tinged with snow
Oh yes it is the same dear face I loved so many years ago
Oh no I cannot take your hand

Farewell I think I love you yet as friend to friend God bless you dear
And guide you through these weary years to where the skies are always clear
Oh no I cannot take your hand

Oh no I cannot take your handWell I dreamed I saw the knights in armor coming
Saying something about a queen
There were peasants singing and drummers drumming
And the archer split the tree
There was a fanfare blowing to the sun
That was floating on the breeze
Look at Mother Nature on the run
In the twentieth century
Look at Mother Nature on the run
In the twentieth century
I was lying in a burned out basement
With the full moon in my eyes
I was hoping for replacement
When the sun burst through the sky
There was a band playing in my head
And I felt like I could cry
I was thinking about what a friend had said
I was hoping it was a lie
Thinking about what a friend had said
I was hoping it was a lie
I dreamed I saw the silver space ships flying
In the yellow haze of the sun
There were children crying and colors flying
All around the chosen ones
All in a dream all in a dream
The loading had begun
Flying Mother Nature silver seed
To a new home in the sun
Flying Mother Nature silver seed
To a new homeI was born on the bayou thirty miles of Lafayettes
My daddy was a Cajun man Lord he thought us how to plow
I remember Mamas breakfast cush cush and a kaye
Being served on a banyee Lord I wish I had some now
Im a Cajun born Im a Cajun bred
And when I die Im a Cajun dead
If I die in Alaska if I die in Ohio
This soul will find its way back to the bayou
We went to church every Sunday we had a French speaking preacher man
Joked about the preacher man cause we thought he wore a dress yes
After church we had a party we played the music on the phonograph
We had a man singing Jole Blon oh made a sinner out of me
Im a Cajun born Im a Cajun bred
And when I die Im a Cajun dead
If I die in Alaska if I die in Ohio
This soul will find its way back to the bayou
When Im ready to be married going to be this Cajun lady
Someone sort of like my Mama
Cause I aint know other kind dont know other kind
Wherever fortune takes me if it makes me or it breaks me
Its memories will forsake me Louisiana on my mind
Im a Cajun born Im a Cajun bred
And when I die Im a Cajun dead
If I die in Alaska if I die in Ohio
This soul will find its way back to the bayou
If I die in Alaska if I die in Ohio
This soul will find its way back to the bayouOh the pain of loving you oh the misry I go through
Never knowing what to do oh the pain of loving you
You just cant stand to see me happy seems you hurt me all you can
Still I go on loving you but Ill never understand
Oh the pain of loving you
acguitar - steel
To love and hate at the same time the line between the two is fine
But too has bound me heart and soul so strong that I cant let you go
Oh the pain of loving you
Oh the pain of loving youCome gather round me boys and lend an ear
Ive got some things I think you all should hear
Its time to shift into another gear

Hand in hand for our love is true
Oh the words that we have spoken
Will be a promise never broken
Heart to heart hand in hand with youWhen they carried you into the parlor
Your wounds were the worst Id seen
Cold as snow as your body trembled
Cradled in the arms of morphine
All the kinfolk cried out loud
Good Shepherd save this man
But you whispered with icy breath
It is not in His hands and you said
Heaven aint ready for me yet and you looked at me
Give me your heart and take a bet and you held my hand
Now Ive seen your face now that weve met
I shall not slip away
Mama said to me daughter
You must nurse your cousin well
So I cared for you through days and nights
But your fever I did not quell
For weeks I watched you suffer pain
That no laudanum could ease
All I had left to do is pray
Lord have mercy on him please and you said
Heaven aint ready for me yet and you looked at me
Give me your heart and take a bet and you held my hand
Now Ive seen your face now that weve met
I shall not slip away
Now winters lights has cooled the air
At last your strengths returned
You talk to me of the life you spent
And of the life youve earned
Youll waste no time on vengeance
Youve no wish to fight again
To find peace you say In God we trust
But little faith in Man
Heaven aint ready for you yet Jesse
Ill give you my heart Ill take a bet Jesse
Now Ive seen your face now that weve met
I shall not slip awayThis is to mother you
To comfort you and get you through
Through when your nights are lonely
Through when your dreams are only blue
This is to mother you
This is to be with you
To hold you and to kiss you too
For when you need me I will do
What your own mother didnt do
Which is to mother you
All the pain that you have known
All the violence in your soul
All the wrong things you have done
I will take from you when I come
All mistakes made in distress
All your unhappiness
I will take away with my kiss yes
I will give you tenderness
For child I am so glad Ive found you
Although my arms have always been around you
Sweet bird although you did not see me
I saw you
And Im here to mother you
To comfort you and get you through
Through when your nights are lonely
Through when your dreams are only blue
This is to mother youydam i solider of the cross
a follower of the lamb
and shall i fear to own his cause
or blush to speak his name

of galilee of galilee
my jesus is walking on the sea
on the sea the sea the sea
of galilee of galilee
my jesus is walking on the sea
nust i be carried to the skies
on flowery beds of ease
while others fought to win the prize
and sailed through bloody seas
repeat chours
there shall i bathe my weary soul
in seas of heavenly rest
and not a wave of trouble roll
across my peaceful breast
repeat choursPlaisir damour
Ne dure quun moment
Chagrin damour dure
Toute la vie
Joys of love
Are but a moment long
Pain of love endures
The whole life longIn my imagination
You are my dear companion
And Im the one you cling to
And your voice still calls my name
Before your heart began to wander
And mine was torn asunder
Before the fairer and the younger
Before the cryin game
All those girls with their long dark tresses
Waltzing out in their Sunday dresses
All their sweet soft warm caresses
Cannot hold you like l do
And though you say you do notlove me
And your dreams are never of me
I will dream my dream of you
In my dreams you are the swallow
Coming back to Capistrano
And Im the sound of the bells you follow
But in this world dreams dont come true
Still when youre lost out in the desert
When your fires a dying ember
The last light you remember
Will be the light l shed for you
Mine is no ordinary star love
I see exactly where you are love
And no one else could shine that far love
To bring you safely through
And though you say you do not want me
And made no promises to haunt me
I will dream my dream of you
The sorrows flow down like a fountain
Over the miles beyond our countin
More than the flowers of the mountain
Or the raindrops in the sea
But if Heavens just a dreaming
Surely my love will be redeeming
And you will dream your dream of meAngel eyes angel eyes
The ways of the world are feeble
Dont give up on simple people
Angel eyes
The blues you can live without
Its not what you songs about
Angel eyes angel eyes
Tell me what would we do without
No light from angel eyes
You can move the hearts of men
Just with a phrase youre turning
Since hearts ever have been yearning and so alone
Thin lines youve been living on
Are so close to the danger zoneTempted and tried were oft made to wonder why it should be thus all the day long
While there are others living about us never molested though in the wrong
When death has come and taken our loved ones it leaves our home so lonely and dreary
Then do we wonder why others prosper living so wicked year after year
Farther along well know all about it farther along well understand why
Cheer up my brother live in the sunshine well understand it all by and by
Faithful till death said our loving master a few more days to labor and wait
Toils of the road will then seem as nothing as we sweep through the beautiful gates
Farther along well know all about it
Yes well understand it all by and byBORN TO RUN
Well I never did crawl and I never did toe the line
No man is a master to me I aint that kind
I just put on my travelin shoes
If you wanna win you just cant lose the time
Or stay behind
Well I was born to run
To get ahead of the rest
And all that I wanted was to be the best
Just to feel free and be someone
I was born to be fast I was born to run
Well I take the chances for the time I made mistakes
But you dont get nothin unless you take the breaks
Livin as dangerous as dynamite
Sure it makes you feel nervous but it makes you feel
alright
Makes you feel alrightYou ask me if Ive met your baby
I have to say
Its been some time now
Seems like yesterday
He was mine
For a while
We had good times
We went in style
But now hes yours
Treat him kind
Yes I remember well when
He was mine
You say he means the world to you
Well yes I can tell
Youll make each other happy
I wish you well
He was mine
For a while
We had good times
We went in style
But now hes yours
Treat him kind
Yes I remember well when
He was mine
Yes I remember well when
He was mine
He was mine
He was mine
He was mine
He was mineA light shines from my window
I just cant sleep no more
Lord it hurts so much to be alone
But the real men never do admit
That its them that might be wrong
At least thats what he told me in his song
He rode all the way to Texas
On an old freight train
Didnt miss the girl he left behind
He rode all the way to Texas
Didnt shed a tear
Hes lettin you know that hes the movin kind
The freedom that he sings about
I guess Ill never know
I just cant shake the guilt or kill the pain
But he lets me ride when the lights turns low
Get on board the radio and take a ride to Texas on his train
He rode all the way to Texas
On an old freight train
Didnt miss the girl he left behind
He rode all the way to Texas
Didnt shed a tear
Hes lettin you know that hes the movin kindNo affection were the words that stuck on my mind
When she walked out on me for the very last time
Oh mamma sweet mamma can you tell me what to say
I dont know what Ive done to be treated this way
In a cold dirty room thats where I found myself
With a bottle of wine and some pills off the shelf
Oh mamma sweet mamma can you tell me what to say
I dont know what Ive done and Im feeling so ashamed
Then an angel appeared she was just seventeen
In a dirty old gown with a conscious so clean
Oh mamma sweet mamma can you tell me what to say
Shes brought back the life that I once threw away
Shes brought back the life that I once threw awayUh uh

But I cant hold the secret Im keeping Im breaking apart
Cant seem to mind my own business whatever I try turns out wrong
I seem like my own false witness and I cant go on
I cover my ears I close my eyes
Still hear your voice and its telling me lies telling me lies
You told me you needed my company and I believed in your flattering ways
You told me you needed me forever nearly gave you the rest of my days
Shouldve seen you for what you are should never have come back for more
Shouldve locked up all my silver brought the key right to your door
I cover my ears
strings
You dont know what a chance is until you have to seize one
You dont know what a man is until you have to please one
Dont put your life in the hands of a man with a face for every season
Dont waste your time in the arms of a man whos no stranger to treason
I cover my ears
I cover my ears
I cover my earsO Evangeline you been gone so long
And for a time it seemed
Every road you took turned wrong
But a second chance would come
With each new bridge you burned
I know you squandered some
But then from some you learned
And the point of rescue well
You passed that long ago
O but to hear you teil it was
Just another part of the show
O Evangeline your faith shone blind and true
We raise our glass and sing
Of you Evangeline
O Evangeline you with no kith or kin
The nights so hard and mean
You shed them like a skin
For you were always strong
When the bad slid down to worse
You still had that song
It was your blessing and your curse
But in your tongue
There is no word for home
Therell be no one
To roll away the stone
O Evangeline you have been a prisoner here
Bread and roses we shall bring
To you Evangeline
O Evangeline what are you fighting for
You stayed out in that ring
When nobodys even keepin score
But round by round you earned
Your stumble into grace
Still with every turn the world
Becomes a sadder place
It swallows up the ones
You have loved the most
So you sleep with none
You wake with ghosts
O Evangeline
You have salted with your tears
Every lonely mile youve seen
through the years Evangeline
Its a fatal shore
You now wash upon
So weary of the war
And no longer young
O Evangeline your voice
Risin sweet and clear
We close our eyes and dream
Of you EvangelineDaddy had a one thousand, nine hundred and forty-nine Ford
When I was just about ten years old
We would listen to Hank And Lefty on the radio
Why dont you love me like you used to do
And just look what thoughts will do
Old Hank And Lefty raised my country soul
Now I learned how to sing and shuffle my shoes
Listenin to Hank sing the lovesick blues
We never met old Hank but we was awful close
Cut my teeth on Always Late
And I Love You A Thousand Ways
Old Hank And Lefty raised my country soul
Daddy said the hair on his neck would crawl
When old Hank sang about the light he saw
Hank sure put a whole lot of heart in the songs he wrote
Every time daddy got a little bit tight
Mom and dads waltz would make him cry
Old Hank And Lefty raised my country soul
Now I learned how to sing and shuffle my shoes
Listenin to Hank sing the lovesick blues
We never met old Hank but we was awful close
Cut my teeth on Always Late
And I Love You A Thousand Ways
Old Hank And Lefty raised my country soul
Old Hank And Lefty raised my country soulThe hills were alive with wildflowers and I was as wild even wilder than they
For at least I could run they just died in the sun and I refused to just wither in place
Just a wild mountain rose needing freedom to grow
So I ran fearing up where Id go
When a flower grows wild it can always survive wildflowers dont care where they grow
And the flowers I knew in the fields where I grew
Were content to be lost in the crowd
They were common and close I had no room for growth
And I wanted so much to branch out
So I uprooted myself from home ground and left
Took my dreams and I took to the road
When a flower grows wild it can always survive wildflowers dont care where they grow
acguitar
I grew up fast and wild and I never felt right in a garden so different from me
I just never belonged I just longed to be gone so the garden one day set me free
I hitched a ride with the wind and since he was my friend
I just let him decide where wed go
When a flower grows wild it can always survive wildflowers dont care where they grow
Just a wild mountain rose seeking mistries untold no regret for the path that chose
When a flower grows wild it can always survive wildflowers dont care where they grow
Mhm hm hm mhm
Wildflowers dont care where they growI see a million old memories each day
That remind me of what used to be
My aching heart tells me they are here to stay
Since you made a memory of me
I tossed and I turned night after night
Those memories just wont let me sleep
The flame in my heart is still burning bright
Though you made a memory of me
I passed by the house we once loved in
For a glimpse of what I thought was our dream
But these days I find the dream was all mine
Cause you made a memory of me
I passed by the house we once loved in
For a glimpse of what I thought was our dream
But these days I find the dream was all mine
Cause you made a memory of meIm falling down
I need to sleep
Come a long long way
No time for weepin
No time for weepin
Quiet now Im falling down
Im falling down
I have heard
A million tales
I have told
A million more
Some of them
Must have been true
But I dont know anymore
Im falling down
Do your dance on my head
Heavy steps of the dead
Everything the snow surrounds
Falling falling falling falling
Falling falling down
Im falling downI was once some mothers darlin
Some daddys little girl
More precious than the ruby
More cherished than the pearl
My heart was full of mercy
And my forehead full of curl
Now I am nothing and am lost unto this world
I am lost unto this world
They herded me like cattle
Cut me down like corn
Took me from my babies
Before they could be born
You can blame it on the famine
You can blame it on the war
You can blame it on the devil
It dont matter anymore
I am lost unto this world
I was tortured in the desert
I was raped out on the piain
I was murdered by the high way
And my cries went up in vain
My blood is on the mountain
My blood is on the sand
My blood runs in the river
That now washes through their hands
I am lost unto this world
Can I get no witness this unholy tale to teil
Was God the only one there watching
And weeping as l feil
O you among the living
Will you remember me at all
Will you write my name out
With a single finger scrawl
Across a broken window
In some long forgotten wall
That goes stretching out forever
Where the tears of heaven fall
I am lost unto this worldThough the miles are between us I thought our love would strengthen
As it has so many times before
But something has happened I can see it in your eyes
I can feel my world is crumblin and the blues are at my door
The last letter that you wrote was on a blue piece of paper
That old feelins back the clouds are moving in
The beginning of the end is near I feel your love has faded
Into darkness it seems I have no friend I feel the blues movin in
guitar
Oh its not the words you wrote that made me sad and broken hearted
Thats put me in this sad shape Im in
Tween the lines are mixed emotions and theres teardrops on the paper
You said thats all Ill write today Ill cose for now old friend
The last letter that you wrote
fiddle
My state of mind is desperate and this hole that Im sinking in
Gets deeper while Im digging to get out
Oh please give the right answer to the questions Im asking
Tell me you still love me that would turn my world about
The last letter that you wrote
I feel the blues movin in I feel the blues movin in
mandolin - fiddle The strange young man who comes to me
A soldier on a three day spree
He needs one nights cheap ecstasy
And a womans arms to hide him
He greets me with a courtly bow
And hides his pain by acting proud
He drinks too much and he laughs too loud
How can I deny him
Let us dance beneath the moon
Ill sing to you Claire de Lune
The morning always comes too soon
But tonight the war is over
He speaks to me in schoolboy French
Of a soldiers life inside a trench
Of the look of death and the ghastly stench
I do my best to please him
He puts two roses in a vase
Two roses sadly out of place
Like the gallant smile on his haggard face
Playfully I tease him
Hold me neath the Paris skies
Lets not talk of how or why
Tomorrows soon enough to die
But tonight the war is over
We make love too hard too fast
He falls asleep his face a mask
He wakes with the shakes and he drinks from his flask
I put my arms around him
They die in the trenches and they die in the air
In Belgium and France the dead are everywhere
They die so so fast theres no time to prepare
A decent grave to surround them
Old world glory old world fame
The old worlds gone gone up in flames
Nothing will ever be the same
And nothing lasts forever
Oh Id pray for him but Ive forgotten how
And theres nothing nothing that can save him now
Theres always another with the same funny bow
And who am I to deny themWatching the long faces
Riding this run down track
And the lost places
From a dream that never brings them back
And the sad truth is nothing but a cold hard fact
Im riding the blue train
Over the miles yet to cover
A ghost in a hurry to fade
Im taking it one way to nowhere
Afraid you might be there
To find me inside this blue train
Counting the burned bridges
Trailing this rusted wreck
As our back pages
Scatter in the dust we left
Like a pearl necklace
Fallen from around your neck
Im riding the blue train
Over the miles yet to cover
A ghost in a hurry to fade
Im taking it one way to nowhere
Afraid you might be there
To find me inside this blue train
Away down the low road
A ticket to an empty room
A rendezvous unknown
Im riding the blue train
Over the miles yet to cover
A ghost in a hurry to fade
Im taking it one way to nowhere
Afraid you might be there
To find me inside this blue trainBad news black day
Theres been a wreck on the highway
Drivin fast in distress
Hit a curve and died in the darkness
Hell never know how much I lose
Bad news
Bad news sirens whine
He rode the devil down the white line
Johnny Walker by his side
Always our there lookin for the last ride
Hell never know how much I lose
Bad newsIf I had a bird a little bird
I would teach that bird to sing your name
Prettiest song that you have ever heard
And your indifferent heart I will claim
So be off my little bird
Fly away fly away
And when my love you see
Only then my little bird
Cry away cry away and bring that heart to me
If I had a moon in the sky
I would light the world and pull the tide
And when the moon is full like my heart
It will surely pull you to my side
But in the darkest night I pine away
Pine away until your face I see
So throw your light my lovely moon
Shine away shine away and pull his heart to me
If I had a wagon made of gold
Pretty painted horses numbered four
With a silver harness I would hitch them up
And drive that wagon to your door
And if my hand you choose to hold
Ride away ride away with the pretty horses four
But darlin if you hearts still cold
Hide away hide away till trouble you no more
Trouble you no moreAs each long day rolls by and falls behind me
In the lonely night theres a peacefulness Ive found
Tho Im weary even then
When I rise to start again
Therll be a diamond a diamond in my crown
I have wasted all that life has laid before me
I have watched as all the green fields turn to brown
But I shall not disavow
All these ties that bind me now
Therll be a diamond a diamond in my crown
Shinning down some day I know
Brighter than all their streets of gold
When the burdens that I carry I will lay down
And the sorrows I have known
Ill see them all be overthrown
Therll be a diamond a diamond in my crown
Through the passing of the years I will grow stronger
Just as sure as this old world keeps spinning round
Then the closer I will be
To my sweetest victoryO the walls are closin in I can feel it in my bones
Like water risin up to my chin
Another long night to be alone
I could go out on the town
Talk too much and laugh too loud
If Im already on my way down
I might as well just work the crowd
Can you hear me now
O the stories I could tell
Sometimes I really hit my stride
We make our own Heaven and our own Hell
Tryin to get across to the other side
But everyday ends up the same
One step up two steps back
Like some old silent movie frame
Zoom in close then fade to black
Can you hear me now
How did the load get to be
so heavy I used to wear my trouble like a crown
A bad floods poundin on the levee
And Im gonna need some help
To hold my ground
But Im sinkin like a stone
To where in solitude this life Ill spend
In the coldest place Ive ever known
Im here just waitin until the end I send up my SOS
A message in a bottle set out to sea It just readsYou say tomorrow youre going
Well thats so hard for me to believe
Im making plans for the heartaches
Cause youre making plans to leave
The tears for me will be falling
Like a tree shedding its leaves
Im making plans for the tear drops
Cause youre making plans to leave
Youre making plans to forget me
Im making plans to miss you
Im getting ready to grieve
Im making plans to be lonesome
Cause youre making plans to leave
Im making plans to be lonesome
Cause youre making plans to leave
Im making plans to be lonesome
Cause youre making plans to leaveWhy dont you call me
Do you think I wont answer
Jupiters risin
And the moon is in cancer
You been down in the hunger baby
I been around there too
Tonight you could be in the arms of
The arms of a woman who loves you
You got your questions
Baby I got an answer
Or just the hands of a healer
And the feet of a dancer
Yeah its all in the wrists now baby
And when the aim is true
Therell be no blink of the eyes baby
The eyes of this woman who loves you
The eyes of this woman who loves you
The eyes of this woman who loves you
Heavens gettin nearer
Transmission gettin clearer
Now my love
Stars are fallin over the ocean
Come on and show a little emotion now
My love
Why dont you call me
You know Im gonna answer
Temperatures risin
And the moon is in cancer
Theres a road you can ride now baby
Out to that wild and blue
It runs right through the heart of
The heart of this woman who loves you
Yeah right through the heart of
The heart of this woman who loves youAll I left behind should come as no surprise
To me since I fell through the black hole of your eye
Only little things inconsequential I could say
Of all I left behind with you along the lost highway
Silver earrings in Wichita
Beaded moccasins in Tonapah
But I had you so
I just let them go
The flannel shirt I wore to keep me from the cold
When we drove from Boston all the way to Buffalo
The leather boots I bought so many miles ago
I took them off to follow you into the Ohio
Never did my armor feel so thin
Silk was all I had between me and your skin
Like Waterloo I lost that too
And the gold bracelet with my fathers name inscribed
On the back by the one who loved him all her life
The way I too could have loved you
The Spanish shawl I put across the broken shade
Of the lamp that lit the room
That last night near Cour dAlene
Only little things inconsequential I could say
Of all I left behind with you along the lost highway
Of all I left behindTrouble we have known trouble
In our struggle just to get by
Many times the burdens been heavy
Still we carried on side by side
Chorus
And when were gone long gone
The only thing that will have mattered
Is the love that we shared
And the way that we cared
When were gone long gone
And when were walking together in glory
Hand in hand through eternity
Its the love that will be remembered
Not wealth not poverty
ChorusWell tonight Im gonna wear my dancin shoes
Cause I heard the word and I heard the news
Theres a gal in town shes packin em in
If youve seen her once youll see her again
Shes got a red hot dynamite band
Theyre burnin down another one-night stand
Headlinin double shows
Everybody go see Sally Rose
She sure knows how to rock the crowd
Rocks em slow rocks em loud
So you better move fast cause tickets are tight
If you want to see Sally Rose pick it tonightHer mama picked him up in south Minnesota
He promised her the world but they never got that far
For he was last seen in that fifty-nine DeSota
When Sally was born in the black hills of Dakota
She was washed in the blood of the dying Sioux nation
Raised with a proud but a wandering heart
And she knew that her roots were in the old reservation
But she had stars in her eyes and graeter expectations
No rings on her fingers no bells on het toes
With bugs on her headlights
And runs in her hose
Through the valley of the shadow of Roosevelts nose
Adios South Dakota adios Sally Rose
Theyve got a national monument carved out of stone
On the side of a mountain where her forefathers roamed
Playing cowboys and Indians right under the nose
Of Theodore Roosevelt and the sweet Sally Rose
So she left Rapid City in the blue moonlight hour
With her eye on the highway and her foot on the floor
And turnin the dial she was pulled by the power
Of the word coming out of that broadcasting towerHe was a tall man
Raised up from the fields out pickin cotton
In a hard land where the ground was poor and the wood was rotten
But when he saw her
All those bad times were forgotten
And he believed he believed
She was the strong hand
A good sister and a daughter
Lookin for one man
To love the way that her mamad taught her
And when she saw him
She thanked God for what hed brought her she believed she believed
And its a miracle
How one soul finds another
Just one miracle
Is all it took my brother
For I have seen them
As they walk this world together
And I believe I believe
Its a sad thing
When one must leave the other
And fly up where the voice rings
Out with all the multitudes that gather
But for a short while
Down here no song ever sounded sweeter
And we believed we believed
For its a miracle
How one soul finds another
Just one miracle
Is all it took my brother
And I will see them
Someday theyll walk again together
I believe I believe
This I believe I believeGo to sleep you little babe
Go to sleep you little babe
Your mamas gone away and your daddys gonna stay
Didnt leave nobody but the baby
Go to sleep you little babe
Go to sleep you little babe
Everybodys gone in the cotton and the corn
Didnt leave nobody but the baby
Youre sweet little babe
Youre sweet little babe
Honey in the rock and the sugar dont stop
Gonna bring a bottle to the baby
Dont you weep pretty babe
Dont you weep pretty babe
Shes long gone with her red shoes on
Gonna need another lovin baby
Go to sleep you little babe
Go to sleep you little babe
You and me and the Devil makes three
Dont need no other lovin baby
Go to sleep you little babe
Go to sleep you little babe
Come and lay your bones on the alabaster stones
And be my ever-lovin babytheres a greengreen place
where you lift your face
to the sound of the waves and the wind
down by the shore
where my soul does endure
where the Mother Sea ends and begins
take me home
to the sand and the foam
where my dreams walk in the mist
ill fall to the earth and root like a rose
in the salt land
that gave me my birth
though i wander afar
the same seathe same stars
still shine to the tears in my eyes
they take me home to a land
that my soul understands
where the heart of the rose never dies
take me home
to the sand and the foam
where my dreams walk in the mist
ill fall to the earth and root like a rose
in the salt land
that gave me my birthcome all you fair and tender ladies
take warning how you court your men
there like a star on a summer morning
they first appear and then there gone
theyll tell to you some loving story
then they make you think that they love you well
then away theyll go to court some other
and leave you there in grief to dwell
mandolin break
i wish i was on some tall mountain
where the ivy rocks are black as ink
id write a letter to my false true lover
whose cheeks are like the morning dew
dorbo and fiddle solo
oh love is handsome love is charming
and love is pretty while its new
but love grows cold as love grows old
and fades away like morning dew

Â one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-six Geordie Music Pub Co
Oh have you seen my dear companion
For he was all this world to me
I hear hes gone to some far country
And that he cares no more for me
I wish I were a swallow flying
Id fly to a high and lonesome place
Id join the wild birds in their crying
Thinking of you and your sweet face
Oh have you seen my dear companion
For he was all this world to me
But now the stars have turned against me
And he cares no more for me
Oh when the dark is on the mountain
And all the world has gone to sleep
I will go down to the cold dark waters
And there Ill lay me down and weep
Oh have you seen my dear companion
Oh have you seen my dear companion
Oh have you seen my dear companion
For he was all this world to meChorus
Well Im hanging up my heart in the lodge in the bunkhouse
I dont wanna be wounded by the wrong kind of love
No more rodeo dances no more howling at the moonlight
Im gonna give em up and Im hanging up my heart
Late in the night been working every day to keep you satisfied
It just aint right to hear you say to me you would let love slide
Chorus
If I were you Id try to understand and see my point of view
If I were you Id never be the one who treats me like you do
If I were you Id never have said goodbye tore my world apart
If I were you Id never have played the game you fooled me from the start
Well Im hanging up my heart in the lodge in the bunkhouse
I dont wanna be wounded by the wrong kind of love
No more rodeo dances no more howling at the moonlight
Im gonna give em up and Im hanging up my heart
Yes Im gonna give em up and Im hanging up my heartHeres to the corners yet to turn
Heres to the bridges yet to burn
Heres to the whole thing blown apart
Its open season on my heart
Days go by like flying bricks
Leave gaping holes too deep to fix
Id just stay home if I were smart
Its open season on my heart
I cant blame anyone but me
For this restless fool Ive come to be
My tired excuses just dont fit
It dont look good from where I sit
I tried to change without much luck
I reach a point where I get stuck
I hit the streets and the fireworks start
Its open season on my heart
I cant be something that Im not
I cant give you what I havent got
I dont know where Ill while away
I only know the shape of you
Heres to the clown down in the mouth
Heres to the whole thing going south
Just stay home if I were smart
Its open season on my heart
I hit the streets and the fireworks start
Its open season on my heartI like it black just black as night
It keeps me up it keeps me tight
It dont matter the size of the cup
Just as long as you fill it up
With black caffeine
Keeps me lean
You can hear me scream
Give me black caffeine
Oh Ive got a monkey sittin on my back
And wouldnt you know he likes it black
Dont need no cream no nicotine
All that monkey need is the black caffeine
More black caffeine
It keeps me lean
You can hear him scream
Give me black caffeine
Give me black caffeine
Im sound of body Im sound of mind
Until it comes to my coffee time
Dont stand in my way dont hold me back
Just keep it hot and keep it black
Good black caffeine
It keeps me lean
You can hear me scream
Give me black caffeine
The devil said I want your soul
I want your silver I need your gold
Well you can have anything Ive got
Dont let him in my coffee pot
Full of black caffeine
It keeps me lean
Can you hear me scream
Give me black caffeine
More black caffeine
It keeps me lean
Can you hear me scream
More black caffeine
More black caffeine
Yeah black caffeineI couldnt sleep last night just walk the floor
Dont know how Ill stand this anymore
Lonely all the time since I lost you
Received your invitation to the blues
I dont know why you cause me such pain
I just hope Ill never go through this much again
Chorus
Thanks for sending something I cant use
I received your invitation to the blues
You took the laughter from this world of mine
Thanks to you the sun will never shine
Walked the floor so much wore out my shoes
Received your invitation to the blues
I dont know why you cause me such pain
I just hope Ill never go through this much again
Lonely me I dont know what to do
I received your invitation to the blues
ChorusI guess you had to be there
She said you had to be
She handed me a yellowed photograph
And then said see
This was my greatest love
My one and only love
And this is me
Back when we were beautiful
See
I dont feel very different
She said I know its strange
I guess Ive gotten used to
These little aches and pains
But I still love to dance
You know we used to dance
But night away
Back when we were beautiful
Beautiful yes
I hated when they said
Im aging gracefully
I fight it every day
I guess they never see
I dont like this at all
Whats happening to me
But I really love my grand kids
She said theyre sweet to hold
They would have loved their grandpa
Those awful jokes he told
You know sometimes for a laugh
The two of us would act
Like we were old
Back when we were beautiful
Beautiful beautiful beautiful yes
But I guess you had to be thereWe are
Counting the stars
Out in the night
Round an old yellow moon
With you
Right by my side
I got nothing to hide
From an old yellow moon
And now
As I turn back the years
So little Ive learned
About heartache and tears
Chorus
But still
Im making my way
Into the heart
Of an unknown highway
We are
Following stars
Way cross the sky
Round an old yellow moon
Chorus
We are
Counting the stars
Out in the night
Round an old yellow moon
Out in the night
Round an old yellow moonI hope that I wont be that wrong anymore
Maybe Ive learned this time
I hope that I find what Im reaching for
The way that it is in my mind
Chorus
Someday Ill get over you
And Ill live to see it all through
But Ill always miss
Dreaming my dreams with you
I wont let it change me not if I can
Id rather believe in love
And give it away as much as I can
To those that Im fond this time
ChorusDid you say that youve been searching for
A place youve never been
Well here it is
Here it is
And youve been down there on the bottom
And looking out for a friend
Here I am
Here I am
Chorus
Weve both grown tired
Of running after rainbows
Here we are
Darling here we are
When it feels like youve been driftin
And you dont know where youve been
Come on in
You can come on in
And if all youve seen are back doors
That lead you out of town
Turn around
You can turn around
Chorus
Weve both grown tired
Of running from each other
Here we are
Darling here we are
Here we are
Here we areOne day train was passin I caught it comin by
Look this old world over under Gods blue sky
My darlin stood there weepin as I was looking back
Kissed my baby cryin in the smoke along the track
Goodbye so long until I come back home youll be my dream
Goodbye so long theres lots of places that Ive never seen
Ill always be a drifter but Ill come driftin back
Where I left you cryin in the smoke along the track
I like to keep on goin it helps me when Im blue
Get the urge to travel thats all I want to do
I just cant seem to settle down because I like to roam
When I hear that whistle blow Ive gotta move along
Goodbye so long theres something down the track keeps callin me
Goodbye so long I guess thats just the way Ill always be
So when I get that feelin dont try to hold me back
Id only leave you cryin in the smoke along the track
I know my baby loves me I love my baby too
He dont understand me when Im feelin blue
When I hear that whistle blow I hurry home and pack
Leave my baby cryin in the smoke along the track
Goodbye so long I hate to leave you but Ive got to go
Goodbye so long its comin down just hear that whistle blow
Itll be here in a minute youll wave and Ill look back
Im gonna leave you cryin in the smoke along the track
Goodbye so long until I come back home youll be my dream
Goodbye so long theres lots of places that Ive never seen
Ill always be a drifter and Ill come driftin back
Where I left you cryin in the smoke along the track
Oh Im gonna leave you cryin in the smoke along the track
Terrific
Nash Randers
Thank you
God bless you all
Youre terrificI never thought Id need you
But now I find Im wrong
Come on back sweet mama
Back where you belong

To find that I cant win
Come on back and pick me up again
Now if I lose

I dont care

How much I lose
If I lose a hundred dollars
While Im tryin to win a dime
My baby shes got money all the time
Of all the other gals Ive known
Theres none to take your place
Cause when I get into a jam
They just aint in the race
So now that youre back here
Lets take another round
With you here by my side
Babe the deal just cant go down
Now if I lose
If I lose
Let me lose

The struggle lives hard times we do or die
My whole crews fly hands high to the sky
So maintain son elevate try to build
But now youre still cause incarceration is for real
Yeah son you know its on
Now who would be the clown in the nine-six to mess around and catch a
fist
I show no mercy if you irk me
I got physical that alert me when some herb tried to jerk me
Or put the squeeze on it break down the cipher
But it wont work were tight like the Q-Tip in the fight
Now is you insane is your brain intact
We be official when it comes to this no BS rap
Here comes the lyrical aerial raid right where you rest at
Now test that
I snatch your heart right through your chest black
Gettin ill thoughts when I sleep at night
I gotta maintain blot the blood stains on my brain
From the clappin we can make it happen
Remember you aint a killer you only rappin
I hate it rappers overexaggeratin
And never shot a gun in they life they only masterbatin
So come clean and keep it real if you like my sound
And wave your hands in the air and put the nines down
Brothas fought daily in the streets we reek havoc
On every block someones flippin like an acrobat
Im kinda young but I still gotta hold my own
And Ima maintain whats mine till the day Im grown
I keep my crew up people say I got a gang
But I dont smoke I dont shoot and my crew dont slang
We just hang tryin to get up in this rap game
So I can gain so fame and build my crews name
Rollin with juvenile thugs wit bad grades and bad ways
Who woulda thought that I had some AIDS
Dream totes and aspirations
Brothas are tired of being broke so maybe thats why they free-basing
Wastin time doing nothing
Livin like an outcast gotta get up get out and get something
Look into my eyes see if you can see what I can see
In my reality the whole world is after me
Schemin on the key but yo I got this locked down
Me and lost and found comin out the underground
Takin no prisoners my listeners we keep it real
My thoughts are militant when Im in the killin field
Click click my minds automatic so wheres the static
I got some joints up in my attic if you want to grab it
I form a cipher where my peace brothers dont sleep
You try to creep I guarantee thats when you feel the heat
I come correct in this rap game
Rappers act insane
Meanwhile Im blowin the mic an back in the frame
They cant see me they cant feel the real G
I represent commercial rap will never kill me
Chorus fourXWho
The wind is blowing across the mountain
Down on the valley way below
It sweeps the grave of my darling
When I die thats where I want to go
Lord send the angels for my darling
And take him to that home on high
Ill wait my time out here on earth love
And come to you when I die
I hear a voice out in the darkness
It calls and whispers through the pines
I know its my sweetheart a calling
I hear him through the walls of time
Lord send the angels for my darling
And take him to that home on high
Ill wait my time out here on earth love
And come to you when I die
Our names are carved upon a tombstone
I promised you before you died
Our love would bloom forever darling
When we rest side by side
Lord send the angels for my darling
And take him to that home on high
Ill wait my time out here on earth love
And come to you when I dieThe cattle are prowlin the coyotes are howlin
Way out where the dogies bawl
Where spurs are a-jinglin a cowboy is singin
This lonesome cattle call
He rides in the sun til his days work is done
And he rounds up the cattle each fall
Singin his cattle call
For hours he will ride on the range far and wide
When the night winds blow up a squall
His heart is a feather in all kinds of weather
He sings his cattle call
Hes brown as a berry from ridin the prairie
And he sings with an ol western drawl
Singin his cattle callLike Strangers thats what we are
Darling how can lovers pull apart so far
Like Strangers how can it be
Only days ago we loved so tenderly
I love you truly I do
And I hope deep in your heart you love me too
Lets forget that weve been angry
Lets be lovers like before
And swear not to be like strangers anymore
Like Strangers thats what we are
Darling how can lovers pull apart so far
Like Strangers how can it be
Only days ago we loved so tenderly
I love you truly I do
And I hope deep in your heart you love me too
Lets forget that weve been angry
Lets be lovers like before
And swear not to be like strangers anymoreIf I could be there Id be there tonight comforting you
This road Im on is so far away
Too far away
If God would grant me wings to fly
Id be in your arms by and by
If I could be there Id be there tonight comforting you
If I could be there Id look in your eyes and say I love you
These hills and highways between us now keep us apart
If God would grant me wings to fly
Id be in your arms by and by
If I could be there Id look in your eyes and say I love you
If I could be there I wouldnt have this pain in my heart
Tomorrow Ill wake up with joy for the day
Joy for the day
If God would grant me wings to fly
Id be in your arms by and by
If I could be there I wouldnt have this pain in my heart
If I could be thereJust about a year ago
I set out on the road
seekin my fame and fortune
lookin for a pot of gold
Things got bad and things got worse
I guess you know the tune
Oh Lord stuck in Lodi again
I came in on a Greyhound
Ill be walkin out if I go
I was just passin through
Must be seven months or more
Ran out of time and money
It looks like they took my friends
Oh Lord stuck in Lodi again
Well The man from the magazine
He said I was on my way
Somewhere I lost connection and
Ran out of songs to play
I came into town on a one-night stand
Looks like my plans fell through
Oh Lord stuck in Lodi again
If I only had a dollar
For every song Ive sung
And every time Ive had to play
While people sat there drunk
You know Id catch the next train
Back to where I live
Oh Lord stuck in Lodi again
Oh Lord Stuck in Lodi again
Oh lord stuck in Lodi againTheres a place out on the edge of town sir
Risin above the factories and fields
Now ever since I was a child I can remember
That mansion on the hill
In the day you can see the children playing
On a road that leads to those gates of hardened steel
Steel gates that completely surround sir
That mansion on the hill
At night my daddy take me and wed ride
Through the streets of a town so silent and still
Park on a back road along the highway signs sir
Look up at the mansion on the hill
In the summer all the lights would shine
Thered be music playin people make all the time
Me and my brother wed lie down in the tall cornfields sir
Sit and listen to the mansion on the hill
Tonight Im here in Linden Town
I watch the cars rushin by home from the mill
Theres a beautiful full moon rising
Above the mansion on the hillSCOTLAND IS AN INSTRUMENTALThose lives were mine to love and cherish
To guard and guide along lifes way
Oh God forbid that one should perish
That one alas should go astray
Back in the years with all together
Around the place wed romp and play
So lonely now I oft times wonder
Oh will they come back home some day
Im lonesome for my precious children
They live so far away
Oh may they hear my calling calling
and come back home some day
I gave my all for my dear children
Their problems still with love I share
Id brave lifes storm defy the tempest
To bring them home from anywhere
I lived my life my love I gave them
to guide them through this world of strife
I hope and pray well live together
In that great glad here after life
Im lonesome for my precious children
They live so far away
Oh may they hear my calling calling
and come back home some dayHey pretty baby are you ready for me
Its your good rockin daddy down from Tennessee
Well Im just outta Austin bound for San Antone
With the radio blastin and the bird dog on
Theres a speed trap up ahead South of town
But no local yokels gonna shut me down
Cause me and the boys got this rig unwound
And weve come a thousand miles from the guitar town
Nothin ever happened round my home town
And I aint the kind to just hang around
But I heard someone callin my name one day
And I followed that voice down the lost highway
Everybody told me you cant get far
Now Im smokin into Texas with the hammer down
And a rockin little combo from the guitar town
Hey pretty baby dont you know it aint my fault
Love to hear the steel belts hummin on the asphalt
Wake up in the middle of the night in a truck stop
Stumble in the restaurant wonderin why I dont stop
Well I gotta keep rockin while I still can
Got a two-pack habit and a motel tan
When my boots hit the boards its a brand new hand
Put my back to the risers and make my stand
Hey pretty baby wont you hold me tight
Im loadin up and rollin out of here tonight
One of these days Im gonna settle down
And Ill take you back with me to the guitar townRay Park
For many long years Ive played a lone hand
I rode my horse in many strange lands
Until one day I stopped for awhile
For two blue eyes and a sunny smile
So howl away you old coyote
I hear your sad and lonesome song
Youre calling me back to old Montana
Back to those hills where I belong
One day I rode away from home
Im a traveling back and it wont be long
Ill see you again in a little while
Youre my darling sweet my welcome smile
So howl away you old coyote
I hear your sad and lonesome song
Youre calling me back to old Montana
Back to those hills where I belong
So howl away you old coyote
I hear your sad and lonesome song
Youre calling me back to old Montana
Back to those hills where I belongWell you ask me if Ill forget my baby
I guess I will some day
I dont like it but I guess things happen that way
You ask me if Ill get along
I guess I will some way
I dont like it but I guess things happen that way
God gave me that girl to lean on then he put me on my own
Heaven help me be a man and have the strength to stand alone
I dont like it but I guess things happen that way
You ask me if Ill miss her kisses
I guess I will every day
I dont like it but I guess things happen that wayNancy Griffith
I am a backseat driver from america
They drive to the left on falls road
And the man at the wheels name is Shamus
We pass a the child on a corner he knows
And shamus says now what chance has that kid got
And I say from the back I dont know
He says theres barbed wire at all of these exits
There aint no place in Belfast for that kid to go
And its a hard life its a hard life
Its a very hard life its a hard life wherever you go
And we poison our children with hatred
And the hard life is all that they know
--- Instrumental ---
At the dairyline in Chicago
A fat man in front of me
Hes calling black people trash to his children
Hes the only trash here I see
And Im thinking this man wears a white hood
In the night when his children should sleep
But theyll slip to their windows and see him
Theyll think that white hoods all they need
And its a hard life its a hard life
Its a very hard life its a hard life wherever you go
And we poison our children with hatred
And the hard life is all that they know
--- Instrumental ---
I was a child of the sixties
When dreams could be held through tears
With Disney and Cronkite and Martin Luther
And I belived I believed I believed
Now Im a backseat driver from America
And Im not at the wheel of control
And I am guilty I am worn I am the root of all evil
And I cant drive on the left side of the road
And its a hard life its a hard life
Its a very hard life its a hard life wherever you go
And we poison our children with hatred
And the hard life is all that they know
And there aint no place in this world for these kids to go
Cause its a hard life wherever you go

Well I really had a ball last night
I held all the pretty boys tight
I was feelin single seein double
Wound up in a whole lotta trouble
But today Ill face the big fight
But I really had a ball last night
When I came home from work this morning
My baby was feelin low
And he told me what was on his mind
Then he told me where I could go
Well I didnt go where he told me to
Cause the water was cold in the lake
Now theres something fishy bout this whole deal
I dont see where I made my mistake
Well I really had a ball last night
I held all the pretty boys tight
I was feelin single seein double
Wound up in a whole lotta trouble
But today Ill face the big fight
But I really had a ball last night
When I woke up this morning
Like me the sun was high
Well I started walking the long way home
Just to think of an alibi
Well I couldnt think of a darn gawn thing
That hadnt already been said
So I guess I better just play it by ear
Cause Im already dead
Well I really had a ball last night
I held all the pretty boys tightThrough the sleepless nights I cry for you
And wonder who is kissing you
Oh these sleepless nights will break my heart again
Somehow through the day I dont give in
I hide the tears that wait until
Oh these sleepless nights will break my heart again
Why did you go why did you go
Dont you know dont you know I need youDolly Parton
Back through the years I go wondering once again
Back to the seasons of my youth
I recall a box of rags that someone gave us
And how my mamma put these rags to use
There were rags of many colours and every piece was small
And I didnt have a coat and it was way down in the fall
Mamma sewed the rags together sewing ever piece with love
She made my coat of many colours that I was so proud of
As she sewed she told the story from the bible she had read
About a coat of many colours Joseph wore and they she said
Perhaps this coat will bring you much love and happiness
And I just couldnt wait to wear it and mamma blessed it with a kiss
My coat of many colours that mamma made for me
Made only rags but I wore it so proudly
Although we had no money oh I was rich as I could be
In my coat of many colours my mamma made for me
So with patches on my breaches and holes in both my shoes
In my coat of many colours I hurried off to school
Just to find the others laughing and makin fun of me
In my coat of many colours my mamma made for me
Oh I couldnt understand it for I felt I was rich
And I told them of the love my mamma sewed in ever stitch
And I told them all the story mamma told me while she sewed
And how my coat of many colours is worth more than all of their clothes
They didnt under stand it and I tried to make them see
That one is only poor only if they choose to be
Now I know we have no money but Im as rich as I could be
In my coat of many colours my mamma made for me
In my coat of many colours my mamma just made for meBaby brought me in out off the highway
Poured my right good liquor down the sink
Straightened out my crooked ways of thinking
And made it purely pleasure when I drank
And its all right now
Ive just hit my stride
Right off the bat
Im drunk on Bluebird wine
Babys up and running in the mornin
Says shes got a million things to do yeah
While Im gone just you go get your guitar
Write some pretty song about me and you
And its all right now
Ive just hit my stride
Right off the bat
Im drunk on Bluebird wine
Baby says shed really love a party
Get some friends together feelin fine yeah
Any friend of mine is worth his habit
A belly full of babys Bluebird wine
And its all right now
Ive just hit my stride
Right off the bat
Im drunk on Bluebird wine
Yes its all right now
Ive just hit my stride
Right off the bat
Im drunk on Bluebird wineThe day breaks your mind aches
You find that all her words of kindness linger on
She no longer needs you
She wakes up she makes up
She takes her time and doesnt feel she has to hurry
She no longer needs you
And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years
You want her you need her
And yet you dont believe her when she said her love is dead
You think she needs you
She goes out you stay home
She says that long ago she knew someone but now hes gone
She doesnt need him
And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no oneIf I could only win your love
Id make the most of everything
Id proudly wear your wedding ring
My heart would never stray one dream away
If I could only win your love
Id give my all to make it live
Youll never know how much I give
If I could only win your love
Oh how can I ever say
How I crave your love when your gone away
Oh how can I ever show
How I burn inside when you hold me tight
If I could only win your love
Id give my all to make it live
Youll never know how much I give
If I could only win your love
Oh how oh how
can I ever say can I ever say
How I crave your love when your gone away
Oh how
can I ever show
How I burn inside when you hold me tight
If I could only win your love
Id give my all to make it live
Youll never know how much I give
If I could only win your loveSweet dreams of you
Every night I go through
Why cant I forget you and start my life anew
Instead of having sweet dreams about you
You dont love me its plain
I should have known youll never wear my ring
I know I should hate you the whole night through
Instead of having sweet dreams about you
Why cant I forget you
Start loving someone new
Instead of having sweet dreams about you
Instead of having sweet dreams about youOoh Las Vegas aint no place for a poor boy like me
Ooh Las Vegas aint no place for a poor boy like me
Every time I hit your crystal city
You know you gonna make a wreck out of me
Well the first time I lose I drink whiskey
Second time I lose I drink gin
Third time I lose I drink anything
Cause I think Im gonna win
Ooh Las Vegas aint no place for a poor boy like me no
Ooh Las Vegas aint no place for a poor boy like me
Every time I hit your crystal city
You know you gonna make a wreck out of me
Well the Queen of Spades is a friend of mine
The Queen of Hearts is a bitch
Someday when I clean up my mind
Ill find out which is which
Ooh Las Vegas aint no place for a poor boy like me
Ooh Las Vegas aint no place for a poor boy like me
Every time I hit your crystal city
You know you gonna make a wreck out of me
Well I spend all night with the dealer
Trying to get ahead
Spend all day at the Holiday Inn
Trying to get out of bed
Ooh Las Vegas aint no place for a poor boy like me
Ooh Las Vegas aint no place for a poor boy like me
Every time I hit your crystal city
You know you gonna make a wreck out of meShel Silverstein
She arrives in all her splendor
Each night at nine oclock
Her chariot is the crosstown bus
That stops right down the block
Now the old piano minstrel plays her tune as she walks in
And the Queen of the Silver Dollars home again
Shes the Queen of the Silver Dollar
She rules this smokey kingdom
Scepter is a wine glass and a bar stool is her throne
Now the jesters flock around her tryin to win her favors
To see which one will take the
Queen of the Silver Dollar home
Now her royal dress is satin
Its shabby and its torn
The royal jewels are rhinestones
The shoes are scuffed and worn
Of the many roads shes been down
And the places that shes seen
Well they all look at her and say God save the queen
Now the Queen of the Silver Dollar
Is not as haughty as she seems
She was once an ordinary girl with ordinary dreams
But theres a man who found her
And he brought her to this world
Hes the one who made a queen of a simple country girl
Yes Im the Queen of the Silver Dollar
I rule this smokey kingdom
Scepter is a wine glass and a bar stool is my throne
Now the jesters flock around me tryin to win my favors
To see which one will take the
Queen of the Silver Dollar home
Yes Im the Queen of the Silver Dollar
I rule this smokey kingdom
Scepter is a wine glass and a bar stool is my throne
Now the jesters flock around me tryin to win my favors
To see which one will take the
Queen of the Silver Dollar homeWinter Summer seasons is taken over its quiet
Like new fallen snow
I told you summer stories but outside is getting mighty cold
I told you everything I could about me
Told you everything I could
How would you feel if the world was falling apart around you
Pieces of the sky were falling in your neighbors yard
But not on you
Wouldnt you feel just a little bit funny
Think maybe theres something you oughta do
Solutions that never lay down before you the answers are all around
Believing is all the friend you need to talk to
Believing in you
I told you everything I could about me
Told you everything I could
I told you everything I could about me
Told you everything I couldTogether again
My tears have stopped falling
The long lonely nights
Are now at an end
The key to my heart
You hold in your hand
And nothing else matters
Were together again
Together again
The gray skies are gone
Your back in my arms
Now where you belong
The love that we knew
Is living again
And nothing else matters
Cause were together again
Together again
My tears have stopped falling
The long lonely nights
Are now at an end
The love that we knew
Is living again
And nothing else matters
Cause were together again
No nothing else matters
Cause were together againMy baby never was the cheatin kind
But it wasnt cause the ladies didnt try
Now everywhere we go
Theyre walkin round him slow
Givin him a flutter and a sigh
Now I got him past that redhead in atlanta
Lord I walked all over that black-eyed cajun queen
But outside of amarillo he found his thrill Ill tell you
Oh I lost him to a jukebox and a pinball machine
Oh amarillo whatd you want my baby for
Oh amarillo now he wont come home no more
You done played a trick on me
Hooked him in the first degree
While he put another quarter
Push dolly and then porter
While he racks up fifty thousand on the pinball machine
If we only hadnt stopped in there for coffee
If someone hadnt played the window up above
Hed still be mine today
But he heard those fiddles play
One look and then I knew this must be love
Oh that pinball machine was in the corner
Well he saw the lights and he had to hear em ring
And he never was the same after he won his first free game
Oh I lost him to a jukebox and a pinball machine
Oh amarillo whatd you want my baby for
Oh amarillo now he wont come home no more
You done played a trick on me
Hooked him in the first degree
While he put another quarter
Push dolly and then porter
While he racks up fifty thousand on the pinball machineHere making each day of the year
Changing my life with one wave of his hand
Nobody can deny that theres something there
Running my hands through his hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking
But he doesnt know shes there
I want him everywhere
And if hes beside me I know I need never care
But to love him is to meet him
Everywhere knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching his eyes and hoping Im always there
To be there and everywhere here there and everywhere
I want him everywhere
And if hes beside me I know I need never care
Oh but to love him is to meet him everywhere
Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching his eyes and hoping Im always there
To be there and everywhere here there and everywhereWeve all got wheels to take ourselves away
Weve got the telephones to say what we cant say
We all got higher and higher every day
Come on wheels take this boy away
Were not afraid to ride
Were not afraid to die
So come on wheels take me home today
Come on wheels take this boy away
And when I feel my time is almost up
And destiny is in my right hand
Ill turn to him who made my faith so strong
Come on wheels make this boy a man
Were not afraid to ride
Were not afraid to die
So come on wheels take me home today
Come on wheels take this boy awayThis old town is filled with sin
It will swallow you in
If youve got some money to burn
Take it home right away
Youve got three years to pay
But Satan is waiting his turn
The scientists say
It will all wash away
But we dont believe any more
Cause weve got our recruits
And our green mohair suits
So please show your ID At the door
This old earthquakes gonna leave me in the poor house
It seems like this whole towns insane
On the thirty-first floor a gold plated door
Wont keep out the Lords burning rain
A friend came around
Tried to clean up this town
His ideas made some people mad
But he trusted his crowd
So he spoke right out loud
And they lost the best friend they had
This old earthquakes gonna leave me in the poor house
It seems like this whole towns insane
On the thirty-first floor a gold plated door
Wont keep out the Lords burning rain
On the thirty-first floor a gold plated door
Wont keep out the Lords burning rainWell I wont have to chop no wood
I can be bad or I can be good
I can be any way that I feel
One of these days
Might be a woman thats dressed in black
Be a hobo by the railroad track
Ill be gone like the wayward wind one of these days
One of these days it will soon
be all over cut and dry
And I wont have this urge to go all bottled up inside
One of these days Ill look back and Ill say I left in time
Cause somewhere for me I know theres peace of mind
I might someday walk across this land
Carrying the Lords book in my hand
Goin cross the country singin loud as I can
One of these days
But I wont have trouble on my back
Cuttin like the devil with a choppin axe
Got to shake it off my back one of these days
One of these days it will soon be all over cut and dry
And I wont have this urge to go all bottled up inside
One of these days Ill look back and Ill say I left in time
Cause somewhere for me I know theres peace of mind
Theres gonna be peace of mind for me one of these daysI know that somewhere theres someone
You love more than me
Someone you love more than me
And I hate to say it
But you have a right to be free
I know thats the way it should be
But Im too far gone
Too far gone
Ive loved you so much for so long
And Im too far gone
If ever your new love
Should hurt you or make you feel blue
Hurt you or make you feel blue
Just remember your old love
Will still be around loving you
Ill be around loving you
Cause Im too far gone
Too far gone
Ive loved you so much for so long
And Im too far goneI dont want to hear a love song
I got on this airplane just to fly
And I know theres life below me
But all that it can show me
Is the prairie and the sky
And I dont want to hear a sad story
Full of heartbreak and desire
The last time I felt like this
I was in the wilderness and the canyon was on fire
And I stood on the mountain
In the night and I watched it burn
I watched it burn I watched it burn
I would rock my soul in the bosom of Abraham
I would hold my life in his saving grace
I would walk all the way from boulder to Birmingham
If i thought I could see I could see your face
Well you really got me this time
And the hardest part is knowing Ill survive
I have come to listen for the sound
Of the trucks as they move down
Out on ninety five
And pretend that its the ocean
Coming down to wash me clean to wash me clean
Baby do you know what I meanNow if I were a queen and a ruler of nations
With diamonds and jewels profound
Well Id rather know that I had salvation
Than to know my reward would be Satans jewel crown
Satans jewel crown Ive worn it so long
But God for my soul has reached down
His love set me free He made me His own
And helped me cast off Satans jewel crown
Oh the life that I live so sinful and needless
Drinkin and runnin around
All the things that I do for the love of the Devil
I know my reward will be Satans jewel crown
Satans jewel crown Ive worn it so long
But God for my soul has reached down
His love set me free He made me His own
And helped me cast off Satans jewel crownEach night I leave the barroom when its over
Not feeling any pain at closing time
But tonight you memory found me much to sober
Couldnt drink enough to keep you off my mind
Tonight the bottle let down
And let you memory come around
The one true friend I thought Id found
Tonight the bottle let down
Ive always had a bottle I could turn to
And lately Ive been turning everyday
But the wind dont take effect the way it used to
And Im hurting in an old familiar way
Tonight the bottle let down
And let you memory come around
The one true friend I thought Id found
Tonight the bottle let downJust like the sun over the mountain top you know Ill always come again
You know I love to spend my morning time like sunlight dancing on your skin
And I have never gone so long just for telling lies to you
What youve seen is what Ive been
There is nothing that I can hide a few you see me better than I can
Out on the road that lies before me now there are some turns where I will spin
I only hope that you will hold me now till I gain control again
Just like a lighthouse you must stand alone and mark the sailors journeys end
And no matter what sea that Ive been sailing on Ill always roll this way again
Out on the road that liesYou left me for the bright lights of the town
A country boy set out to see the world
Remember when those neon lights shine down
That big old moon shines on your Kentucky girl
I swear I love you by the moon above you
How bright is it shining in your world
Some morning when you wake up all alone
Just come on home to your blue Kentucky girl
Dont wait to bring great riches home to me
I need no diamond rings or fancy pearls
Just bring yourself youre all Ill ever need
Thats good enough for this blue Kentucky girl
I swear I love you by the moon above you
How bright is it shining in your world
Some morning when you wake up all alone
Just come on home to your blue Kentucky girl
Just come on home to your blue Kentucky girlI am a poor wayfaring stranger
While traveling through this world of woe
Yet theres no sickness toil or danger
In that bright world to which I go
Im going there to see my father
Im going there no more to roam
Im only going over Jordan
Im only going over home
I know dark clouds will gather around me
I know my way is rough and steep
Yet beauteous fields lie just before me
Where Gods redeemed their vigils keep
Im going there to my mother
She said shed meet me when I come
Im only going over Jordan
Im only going over homeLove hurts love scars love wounds and mars
Any heart not tough nor strong enough
To take a lot of pain take a lot of pain
Love is like a cloud holds a lot of rain
Love hurts uh uh love hurts
Im young I know but even so
I know a thing or two Ive learned from you
Ive really learned a lot really learned a lot
Love is like a stove burns you when its hot
Love hurts uh uh love hurts
Some fools rave of happiness
Blissfullness togetherness
Some fools fool themselves I guess
But theyre not fooling me
I know it isnt true no it isnt true
Love is just a lie made to make you blue
Love hurts uh uh love hurtsLong long time ago when we were young
You swore to me I would be the one
I would be the one you loved
But we had to part
You asked me to wait for you
To keep you in my heart
To keep you in my heart
Night after lonely night Im waiting for you still
High above the lights of town here on heartbreak hill
Now maybe I am the foolish kind to think of you so long
Have you found another love
Am I still the one
Am I still the one for you
But youre far away
Do you ever dream of coming back to me someday
Back to me someday
Night after lonely night Im waiting for you still
High above the lights of town here on heartbreak hill
On heartbreak hill alone at night
I think of how you held me tight
And wonder if I ever will see you again
On heartbreak hill
Oh lord if I only could go back in time enough
Id hold you in my arms again
Never let you go
Never let you go my love
And leave me far behind
High upon this lonely hill were you swore to be mine
You swore to be mine
Night after lonely night Im waiting for you still
High above the lights of town here on heartbreak hill
Night after lonely night Im waiting for you still
High above the lights of town here on heartbreak hill
Here on heartbreak hill
Here on heartbreak hillAt my door the leaves are falling
The cold wild wind will come
Sweethearts walk by together
And I still miss someone
No I never got over those blue eyes
I see them everywhere
I miss those arms that held me
When all the love was there
I go at all the parties
To look for a little fun
But I find the darkened corner
For I still miss someone
No I never got over those blue eyes
I see them everywhere
I miss those arms that held me
When all the love was thereMaking believe
That you still love me
Its leaving me alone and so blue
Still Ill always dream
But Ill never own you
Making believe
Its all I can do
Cant hold you close
When youre not with me
Youre somebodys love
Youll never be mine
Making believe Ill spend my lifetime
Loving you and making believe
Making believe
I never lost you
But my happy hours
Are far and so few
My plans for the future
Will never come true
Making believe
What else can I do
Making believe
Ill spend my lifetime
Loving you and making believeForever my darling
My love will be true
Always and forever
Ill love just you
Just promise me darlin
Your love in return
May this fire in my soul dear
Forever burn
My hearts at your command dear
To keep love and to hold
Making you happy is my desire
Keeping you is my goal
My hearts at your command dear
To keep love and to hold
Making you happy is my desire
Keeping you is my goal
Ill forever love you
The rest of my days
Ill never part from you
And your loving ways
Just promise me darlin
Your love in return
May this fire in my soul dear
Forever burnWhen I saw you standing there on the street
I found myself by your side
I started wanting you again
Theres just no way to hide from that old
Loving You feeling again
Its really got me reeling again
It only seems to stop to start all over again with you
I remember how youd always been
That certain look in your eyes
Your not easy to resist
But I just walked on by
With that loving old feeling again
Its really got me reeling again
Only seems to stop to start all over again with you
Loving you feeling with you
We were so close we were too far apart
I gave you my love
I wanted your heart
Without yesterday haunting the way
Maybe wed still be together
Sharing that loving you feeling again
Its really got me reeling again
Will it ever stop and not start over again
That loving you feeling again
No matter how much I try
This loving you feeling
Its taken such a long time to say goodbye
And getting over you is so hard to do
With this feeling loving you
That loving you feeling againTo know know know him
Is to love love love him
Just to see him smile
Makes my life worthwhile
To know know know him
Is to love love love him
And I do

Everyone says therell come a day
When Ill walk alongside of him
Yes just to know him
Is to love love love him
And I do

How blind can he be
Someday he will see
That he was meant for me
To know know know him
Is to love love love him
Just to see him smile
Makes my life worthwhile
To know know know him
Is to love love love him
And I doWell all I want is a love thats hot

Yeah love that dont try to be somethin its not
Well all I need is a love thats real
None can rob and none can steal
Hey love that moves like a drivin wheel
Well all I want is drivin wheel
All I want is a drivin wheel
All round love my ideal
Well all I want is love thats right
To hold onto with all my might
Hey early in the mornin and late at night
Well all I want is drivin wheel
All I want is a drivin wheel
Hey all round love my ideal

All I want is a drivin wheel
Hey all round love my ideal
All I want is a drivin wheel
All I want is a drivin wheel
Well all round love my idealYou can dance
Every dance with the girl who gives you the eye
Let her hold you tight
You can smile
Every smile for the girl whod like to treat you right
Neath the pale moonlight
But dont forget whos takin you home
And in whos arms youre gonna be
Oh darlin save the last dance for me
Oh I know
That the musics fine like sparklin wine
Go and have your fun
Dance and sing
But while were apart
Dont give your heart to anyone
And dont forget whos takin you home
And in whos arms youre gonna be
Oh darlin save the last dance for me
You can dance
Go and carry on till the night is gone
And its time to go
If she asks
If youre all alone can she take you home
You must tell her no
And dont forget whos takin you home
And in whos arms youre gonna be
Oh darlin save the last dance for me
And dont forget whos takin you home
And in whos arms youre gonna be
Oh darlin save the last dance for meEvery night its the same
I feel your heart turn cold as rain
And know that youll be gone again
I hear the front door close
You say you got to go downtown
I guess theres someone else youve found
So why youre still coming round
Heaven only knows
Heaven only knows just why loving you should make me cry
Make me feel like I could die
Thats the way it goes
Heaven only ever sees
How loves made a fool of me
I guess thats how its meant to be but
Heaven only knows
Ive heard it said that talk is cheap
But still your words they cut so deep
Lay me crying in my sleep
And the pain just grows
I dont know whos right or wrong
But all we had is dead and gone
So why you keep me hanging on
Heaven only knows
Heaven only knows just why loving you should make me cry
Make me feel like I could die
Thats the way it goes
Heaven only ever sees
How loves made a fool of me
I guess thats how its meant to be but
Heaven only knows
Im going to turn and walk away
Theres nothing left for me to say
It wouldnt change things anyway
Though I suppose
The love I gave was always true
Well I dont know what else to do
And how Ill ever get over you
Heaven only knows
Heaven only knows just why loving you should make me cry
Make me feel like I could die
Thats the way it goes
Heaven only ever sees
How loves made a fool of me
I guess thats how its meant to be but
Heaven only knowsPut on another pot o tea
Cause Im in love with the Irish accent to your story
And I need someone to help me
Well they say that now you dont talk straight
And that of late its been my lot to be afraid
To remember you by anything
But memories I already keep
So put another pot o tea
Cause Im love with the Irish accent to your story
And now I need some sympathy
Its harder when it takes so long to leave
The table where we all learned to laugh and learned to grieve
Over the pain that came so close to you
It comes so close to me todayThere he goes gone again
Same old storys gotta come to an end
Lovin him was a one way street
But Im gettin off where the crossroads meet
Quarter moon in a ten cent town
Its time for me to lay my heartaches down
Saturday night Im gonna make myself a name
Take a month of Sundays to try and explain
Its gonna be easy to fill
The heart of a thirsty woman
Harder to kill the ghost of a no good man
And Ill be ridin high
In a fandangled sky
Its gonna be easy
Its gonna be easy from now on
Raw as whip but clean as a bone
Soft to the touch when you take me home
When the mornin comes and its time for me to leave
Dont worry about me
I got a wild card up my sleeveWhen the sun goes down on the other side of town tonight
And the world is asleep dreamin in the deep moonlight
Ill slip away in the shadows out of your life
You dont want me anymore so Ill close the door when I leave
My bags are packed and Ill give you back your keys
You keep your ring and Ill keep your memory
But in my dreams at night oh oh
Everything will work out right
Cause Ill still hold you tight
In my dreams
Well its hard to take when love breaks down and dies
But its better to quit than to sit each night and cry
Id rather know the truth than to live through a life of lies
But in my dreams at night oh oh
Everything will work out right
Cause Ill still hold you tight
In my dreams
Maybe its for the best to give this love of ours a rest
But Ill come runnin back if you want me
Well bye bye baby it seems that were all through
You sure know how make this little girl blue
When you say you dont want the things I can do for you
But in my dreams at night oh oh
Everything will work out right
Cause Ill still hold you tight
In my dreams
In my dreams at night oh oh
Everything will work out right
Cause Ill still hold you tight
In my dreamsOn our wedding day did you lie
Did you know that someday youd say goodbye
Now that youre gone another just wont do
I had my heart set on you
We were so young when we met
Sweet memories linger yet
You were the one who made my dreams come true
I had my heart set on you
As the years come and go does your heart mind
When you think of the girl you left behind
I still wear your ring cause when I said I do
I had my heart set on you
Oh darlin I had my heart set on youTroubles and trials
Often betray us
Tempting the wearing
Body to stray
But we shall all meet
Side the still waters
With the Good Shepherd
Leading the way
Those who have strayed were
Sought by the Master
He who once gave His
Life for the sheep
Out on the mountain
Now He is searching
Bringing them in
Forever to keep
Going up home to
Live in green pastures
Where we shall live and
Die nevermore
Even the Lord will
Be in that number
When we shall reach that
Heavenly Shore
We will not heed the
Voice of the stranger
For he would lead us
On to despair
Following on with
Jesus our Savior
We shall all reach that
Country so fairOh the stars they did shine
The night you swore that youd be mine
And you promised always to be true and to be kind
On that Shenandoah Hill
Where our love bloomed until
I went away and left those promises behind
But when I rise from the timberline
And call your name will you remember mine
And the sweetest kiss will be the tie that binds
Like the wild wild rose and the columbine
To that place I will go
Where the wildwood flowers grow
With a ribbon in my hair and a grown of calico
To those Shenandoah Hills
Ill go back I swear I will
To the sweetest kiss my lips will ever know
And when I rise from the timberline
And call your name will you remember mine
And the sweetest kiss will be the tie that binds
Like the wild wild rose and the columbine
And when I rise when I rise from the timberline timberline
And call your name call your name will you remember mine remember mine
And the sweetest kiss sweetest kiss will be the tie that binds tie that binds
Like the wild wild rose like the rose and the columbine columbine
And when I rise when I rise from the timberline timberline
And call your name will you remember mine remember mine
And the sweetest kiss will be the tie that binds tie that binds
Like the wild wild rose wild wild rose and the columbineDolly Parton
Mama never seemed to miss the finer things of life
If she did she never did say so to daddy
She never wanted to be more than a mother and a wife
If she did she never did say so to daddy
The only thing that seemed to be important to her life
Was to make our house a home and make us happy
Mama never wanted any more than what she had
If she did she never did say so to daddy
He often left her all alone but she didnt mind the staying home
If she did she never did say so to daddy
And she never missed the flowers and the cards he never sent her
If she did she never did say so to daddy
Being took for granted was a thing that she accepted
And she didnt need those things to make her happy
And she didnt seem to notice that he didnt kiss and hold her
If she did she never did say so to daddy
One morning we awoke just to find a note
That mama carefully wrote and left to daddy
And as we began to read it
Our ears could not believe it
The words that she had written there to daddyThe wheels of love turn around and around
Keep on rollin til youve found
The perfect partner somebody just right
To have and hold every day and every night
So shes halfway to Texas with all of your dreams
The world aint as bad as what it might seem
You got a whole lot of living honey left to do
Theres still a whole lot of love inside of you
The wheels of love turn around and around
Theyll take you for a ride like a merry-go-round
Dont let the heartache hold you down
When theres plenty of love to left be found
On the wheels ridin on the wheels of love
Catch you a ride imagine what you might find
Just the right girl at just the right time
Ready and waiting shell look you in the eyes
Ah but the wheels of love will never compromise
So she broke your heart honey dont look back
You got to keep on rollin down the track
And maybe the next time youll keep your feet on the ground
When the wheels of love spin you around
The wheels of love turn around and around
Theyll take you for a ride like a merry-go-round
Dont let the heartache hold you down
When theres plenty of love left to be found
On the wheels ridin on the wheels of love
The wheels of love turn around and around
Theyll take you for a ride like a merry-go-round
Dont let the heartache hold you down
When theres plenty of love left to be found
On the wheels ridin on the wheels of love
Oh the wheels
Ridin on the wheels of loveWe came out west together with a common desire
The fever we had mightve set the west coast on fire
Two months later got trouble in mind
Oh my baby moved out and left me behind
But its all right cause its midnight
And I got two more bottles of wine
The way he left sure turned my head around
Seemed like overnight she just up and put me down
Aint gonna let it bother me today
I been workin and Im too tired anyway
But its all right cause its midnight
And I got two more bottles of wine
Im sixteen hundred miles from the people I know
Ive been doin all I can but opportunity sure come slow
Well Id be in the sun all day
But Im sweepin out a warehouse in west LA
But its all right cause its midnight
And I got two more bottles of wine
Im sixteen hundred miles from the people I know
Ive been doin all I can but opportunity sure come slow
Well Id be in the sun all day
But Im sweepin out a warehouse in west LA
But its all right cause its midnight
And I got two more bottles of wine
Yes its all right cause its midnight
And I got two more bottles of wine
Yes its all right cause its midnight
And I got two more bottles of wineIt seems like I was there from the start
A witness to your wild and reckless heart
You showed me the way but now youre gone
Quicker than the trigger of an outlaws gun
Living fast and dying young
A victim of this road you left me on
White line took my baby
Led him down that dark highway
Headlight-blind driving crazy
If my wheels keep turning
Gonna roll that white line away
We worked the road as hard as we could drive her
But now I am the only survivor
From night to night at every place I play in
The sweetness of your song remains
Ill be the keeper of the flame
Til every soul hears what your heart was saying
White line took my baby
Led him down that dark highway
Headlight-blind driving crazy
If my wheels keep turning
Gonna roll that white line away
All the nights you spent alone
All the love Id never shown
All the words I could not say
That white line took you away
White line took you away
Ill follow this white line down where its winding
Cause somewhere up ahead your lights still shining
The sound of the silver strings will guide me
Ive stood and watched the bridges burn
Im past the point of no return
Oh how I wish that you were here beside me
White line took my baby
Led him down that dark highway
Headlight-blind driving crazy
If my wheels keep turning
Gonna roll that white line away
White line took my baby
Led him down that dark highway
Headlight-blind driving crazy
If my wheels keep turning
Gonna roll that white line away
White line took my baby
Led him down that dark highwayLivin on the road my friend
Was gonna keep you free and clean
Now you wear skin like iron
And your breaths as hard as kerosene
You werent your mamas only boy
But her favorite one it seems
She began to cry when you said goodbye
And sank into your dreams
Pancho was a bandit boys
His horse was fast as polished steel
Wore his gun outside his pants
For all the honest world to feel
Well Pancho met his match you know
On the deserts down in Mexico
And nobody heard his dyin words
Ah but thats the way it goes
All the Federales say
Could of had him any day
Only let him any day
Hang around
Out of kindness I suppose
Lefty he cant sing the blues
All night long like he used to
The dust that Pancho bit down south
Ended up in Leftys mouth
The day they laid poor Pancho low
Lefty split for Ohio
Where he got the bread to gop
There aint nobody knowsTheres a sweet dream on your pillow
Theres a sad song in your eyes
Theres a sunshine behind a dark cloud
Up above you in fools thin air
Shes an old friend shes a good friend
Hair of golden eyes of satin
Shes a wont be long friend till shes gone friend
And leaves you hangin in fools thin air
Like a lion rules the jungle
Youre just flyin through fools thin air
That dont mean nothin when youve got something
You believe in to get you there
Shes an old friend shes a good friend
Hair of golden eyes of satin
Shes a wont be long friend till shes gone friend
And leaves you hangin in fools thin airWell she played around town til she opened the show
For a high-rollin singer up from Tupelo
He saw her in the lights and he give her a hand
Next thing Sally knew she was one of the band
She said dont give me nothin that I cant use
I got the rhythm and I do dont need the blues
I dont want to ride no shootin star
Just want to play on the rhythm guitar
She was the sweetest thing that he ever had seen
And hed had quite a few of them backstage queens
She was the prettiest thing that he ever had heard
Playin rhythm guitar and singin the third
She said dont give me nothin that I cant use
I got the rhythm and I do dont need the blues
I dont want to ride no shootin star
Just want to play on the rhythm guitar
Well Sally keeps her feet planted on the ground
She dont lose her head when the sun goes down
Everybodys out lookin for romance
But Sally just wants to get the people to dance
She said dont give me nothin that I cant use
I got the rhythm and I do dont need the blues
I dont want to ride no shootin star

And I doWell I never did crawl and I never did toe the line
No man is a master to me I aint that kind
I just put on my travelin shoes
If you want to win you just cant lose the time
Or stay behind
Well I was born to run
To get ahead of the rest
And all that I wanted was to be the best
Just to feel free and be someone
I was born to be fast I was born to run
Well I take the chances sometime I made mistakes
But you dont get nothin unless you take the breaks
Livin as dangerous as dynamite
Sure it makes you feel nervous but it makes you feel alright
Makes you feel alright
Well I was born to run
To get ahead of the rest
And all that I wanted was to be the best
Just to feel free and be someone
I was born to be fast I was born to run
Nobody gonna make me do things their way
By the time you figure it out its yesterday
Well it comes to he who waits Im told
But I dont need it when Im old and gray
Yeah I want it today
Well I was born to run
To get ahead of the rest
And all that I wanted was to be the best
Just to feel free and be someone
I was born to be fast I was born to run

To get ahead of the rest
And all that I wanted was to be the best
Just to feel free and be someone
I was born to be fast I was born to runToday I started loving you again
Im right back where Ive really always been
I got over you just long enough to let my heartache mend
Then today I started loving you again
What a fool I was to think I could get by
With only these few million tears Ive cried
I should have known the worst was yet to come
And that crying time for me had just begun
Cause today I started loving you again
Im right back where Ive really always been
I got over you just long enough to let my heartache mend
Then today I started loving you againThe heel of my boot is on the leg of my chair
My chair leans back and rests on the wall
And the wall runs the length of my room to the door
The door reaches down to the sidewalk
And sidewalk leads to the edge of the street
The street takes you out to the old highway
The highway ends at the countyline bridge
The bridge takes you up to the interstate
The interstate rolls on beyond my horizon
Where miles tend to turn into days
Finally runs into high road that winds through the city
That took you away
And it reaches the sidewalk that kisses a wall
And the wall rises up to the thirty-threerd floor
The floor feels you step to the balcony rail
From the rail you look out on the interstate
The interstate rolls on beyond the horizon
A highway of dreams come and gone
Always leads the roads that connect you
to the fool that keeps holding on
The heel of my boot is on the leg of my chair
Aaah Aaah Aaah AaahMaybe tonight Ill get lucky
Ive been lonely too long
Maybe tonight some dark stranger
Will hear me singing this song
Ive been down Ive played around
I dont like it that way
Love wont you treat me right
Maybe tonight
Maybe this time Ill be saying
The words that Ive wanted to say
Maybe this time Ill be staying
For more than just a day
Ive been down Ive played around
I dont like it that way
Love wont you treat me right
Maybe tonight
Im so tired of being free
Of living just for me
Oh love wont you treat me right
Maybe tonight
Maybe tonight Ill get lucky
Ive been lonely too long
Maybe tonight some dark stranger
Will hear me singing this song
Ive been down Ive played around
I dont like it that way
Love wont you treat me right
Maybe tonight
Well Im so tired of being free
Of living just for me
Oh love wont you treat me right
Maybe tonight
Well Im so tired of being free
Of living just for me
Oh love wont you treat me right
Maybe tonight
Oh love wont you treat me right
Maybe tonight

Theres a strong undertow
The surface wont tell you
What the deep water knows
Darling Im saying
I know somethings wrong
Beneath still waters
Your love is gone
Even a fool could see
That youll soon be leaving me
But each and every heart
Must take its turn at misery
And this time its me
And Ill cry alone
Beneath still waters
Your love is gone
Even a fool could see
That youll soon be leaving me
But each and every heart
Must take its turn at misery
And this time its me
And Ill cry alone
Beneath still waters
Your love is gone
Beneath still waters
Your love is gone
Beneath still waters
Your love is goneLast night I dreamed about you
I dreamed that you were older
You were looking like Picasso
With a scar across your shoulder
You were kneeling by the river
You were digging up the bodies
Buried long ago
Michelangelo
Last night I dreamed about you
I dreamed you were a pilgrim
On a highway out alone to find
The mother of your children
Who were still unborn and waiting
In the wings of some desire
Abandoned long ago
Michelangelo
Were you there at Armageddon
Was Paris really burning
Could I have been the one to pull you
From the point of no returning
And did I hear you calling out my name
Or was it forgotten long ago
Michelangelo
Last night I dreamed about you
I dreamed that you were riding
On a blood red painted pony
Up where the heavens were dividing
And the angels turned to ashes
You came tumbling with them to earth
So far below
Michelangelo
Last night I dreamed about you
I dreamed that you laid dying
In a field of thorn and roses
With a hawk above you crying
For the warrior slain in battle
From an arrow driven deep inside you
Long ago
Michelangelo
Did you suffer at the end
Would there be no one to remember
Did you banish all the old ghosts
With the terms of surrender
And could you hear me calling out your name
Well I guess that I will never know
Michelangelo
Last night I dreamed about you
I dreamed that you were weeping
And your tears poured down like diamonds
For a love beyond all keeping
And you caught them one by one
In a million silk bandannas that I gave you long ago
MichelangeloI am just a poor boy though my storys seldom told
I have squandered my existence
On a pocket full of mumbles such are promises
All lies in jest till a man hears what he wants to hear
And disregards the rest
Well I left my home and family I was no more than a boy
In the company of strangers
In the quiet of the railway station runnin scared
Layin low seeking out the poor quarters
Where the ragged people go
Looking for the places only they would know

Only seeking workmans wages I come looking for a job
But I get no offers
Just a come-on from the whores on Seventh Avenue
I do declare there were times when I was so lonesome
I took some comfort there
In a-laying out my winter clothes and wishing I was home
Going home
Where the New York City winters arent a-bleeding me
Bleeding me
Going home
Da da da da da da
Da da da da da da da da da da

In the clearing stands a boxer and a fighter by his trade
And he carries the reminders
Of every bloke that laid him down or cleft him
Till he cried out in his anger and his shame
I am leaving I am leaving
But the fighter still remains

That keeps me close to you dear
And its a sad thing
That were apart Im blue dear
And there are times now
I thank the heavens up above
When Im with the one that I love
Now there are diamonds
That some may long to see
And they may shine
But not bright enough for me
I wouldnt take no
The whole world dipped in gold
For a night with my Tennessee Rose
Take this love that I am giving
For its truly the lasting kind
The gift I hold is believing
That you will always be mine
Take this love that I am giving
For its truly the lasting kind
The gift I hold is believing
That you will always be mine
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh ohWhen I saw you standing there on the street
I found myself by your side
I started wanting you again
Theres just no way to hide
From that old loving you feeling again
Its really got me reeling again
It only seems to stop
To start all over again with you
I remember how youd always been
That certain look in your eyes
Youre not easy to resist
But I just walked on by
With that old lovin you feelin again
Its really got me reelin again
Only seems to stop
To start all over again with you
Lovin you feelin with you
We were so close we were too far apart
I gave you my love I wanted your heart
Without yesterday haunting the way
Maybe wed still be together
Sharin that lovin you feelin again
Its really got me reelin again
Will it ever stop and not start over again
That lovin you feelin again
No matter how much I try
This lovin you feelin is right
Its taken such a long long time to say goodbye
And getting over you is so hard to do
With this feelin lovin you
That loving you feelin again
Lovin you feelin again
That lovin you feelin again
Lovin you feelin again
That lovin you feelin again
Lovin you feelin again
That lovin you feelin againIf I needed you would you come to me
Would you come to me for to ease my pain
If you needed me I would come to you
I would swim the seas for to ease your pain
Well the nights forlorn and the mornings born
And the morning shines with the lights of love
And youll miss sunrise if you close your eyes
And that would break my heart in two
If I needed you would you come to me
Would you come to me for to ease my pain
If you needed me I would come to you
I would swim the seas for to ease your pain
Babys with me now since I showed her how
To lay her lilly hand in mine
Who would Ill agree shes a sight to see
A treasure for the poor to findIts over our love affair
Too late now I find I care
His sweet love no more Ill share
Now hes gone Im alone
I was wrong should have known
Took me home on our last date
I search for a single way
To tell him what I had to say
I kissed him watched him walk away
Set him free foolishly destiny misery
Tragedy on our last date
Took the ring from my trembling fingers
Brushed a tear from my babys eye
Walked away didnt know
That Id soon miss him so
Guess I was too young to realize
So blind I couldnt see
How much he really meant to me
And that soon he would always be
On my mind in my heart I was blind from the start
Lost his love on our last dateIt was a teenage wedding
And the old folks wished them well
You could see that Pierre
Did truly love the mademoiselle
And now the young monsieur and madame
Have rung the chapel bell
Cest la vie say the old folks
It goes to slow you never can tell
They furnished off an apartment
With a two room Roebuck sale
The coolerator was crammed
With TV Dinners and ginger ale
But when Pierre found work
The little money comin worked out well
Cest la vie say the old folks
It goes to show you never can tell
They had a hi-fi phono
Boy did they let it blast
Seven hundred little records
All rockin rhythm and jazz
But when the sun went down
The rapid tempo of the music fell
Cest la vie say the old folks
It goes to show you never can tell
They bought a souped-up Jimmy
Twas a cherry-red fifty three
Drove it down to Orleans
To celebrate their anniversary
It was there that Pierre
Was wedded to the lovely mademoiselle
Cest la vie say the old folks
It goes to show you never can tellIts over our love affair
Too late now I find I care
His sweet love no more Ill share
Now hes gone Im alone
I was wrong should have known
Took me home on our last date
I search for a single way
To tell him what I had to say
I kissed him watched him walk away
Set him free foolishly destiny misery
Tragedy on our last date
Took the ring from my trembling fingers
Brushed a tear from my babys eye
Walked away didnt know
That Id soon miss him so
Guess I was too young to realize
So blind I couldnt see
How much he really meant to me
And that soon he would always be
On my mind in my heart I was blind from the start
Lost his love on our last dateColors of your heart
Like the colors on a pinwheel
Spinning around turning away
Colors of your eyes
Tell me youre changing
Tell me your leaving
And that its too late to try
Diamonds and sand
Slide through your hands
Like youve done through mine
Did I look away
Or did I never say
How I needed you
Colors of your heart
Like the places youre going
Theres no way of knowing
What did I do so wrong
Diamonds and sand
Slide through your hands
Like youve done through mine
Did I look away
Or did I never say
How I needed youWe used to have good times together
But now I feel them slip away
It makes me cry to see love die
So sad to watch good love go bad
Remember how you used to feel dear
You said nothing could change your mind
It breaks my heart to see us part
So sad to watch good love go bad
Is it any wonder that I feel so blue
When I know for certain that Im losing you
It breaks my heart to see us part
So sad to watch good love go bad
So sad to watch good love go badI am searching through the canyon
It is your name that I am calling
Tho youre so far away
I know you hear my plea
Why wont you answer me
Here I am
I am in the blood of your heart
The breath of your lung
Why do you run for cover
You are from the dirt of the earth
And the kiss of my mouth
I have always been your lover
Here I am
I am the promise never broken
And my arms are ever open
In this harbor calm and still
I will wait until
Until you come to me
Here I amLove hurts love scars love wounds and mars
Any heart not tough nor strong enough
To take a lot of pain take a lot of pain
Love is like a cloud holds a lot of rain
Love hurts uh uh love hurts
Im young I know but even so
I know a thing or two Ive learned from you
Ive really learned a lot really learned a lot
Love is like a stove burns you when its hot
Love hurts uh uh love hurts
Some fools rave of happiness
Blissfullness togetherness
Some fools fool themselves I guess
But theyre not fooling me
I know it isnt true no it isnt true
Love is just a lie made to make you blue
Love hurts uh uh love hurtsYou dont love me this I know
Dont need a bible to tell me so
I hung around a little too long
I was good but now Im gone
Like the buffalo
That boy from Tupelo
Any way the wind can blow
Thats where Im gonna go
Ill be gone like a five and dime
Itll be the perfect crime
Just ask the boy from Tupelo
Hes the king and he oughta know
The shoulder Ive been leanin on
Is the coldest place Ive ever known
Theres nothin left for me round here
Looks like its time to disappear
Like the buffalo
That boy from Tupelo
The old wall down in Jericho
Maybelle on the radio
Ill be gone like the five and dime
Itll be the perfect crime
Just ask the boy from Tupelo
Hes the king and he oughta know
You dont love me this I know
Dont need a bible to tell me so
Its a shame and its a sin
Everything I coulda been to you
Your last chance Texaco
Your sweetheart of the rodeo
A Juliet to your romeo
The border you cross into Mexico
Ill never understand why or how
Oh but baby its too late now
Just ask the boy from Tupelo
Hes the king and he oughta knowO the dragons are gonna fly tonight
Theyre circling low and inside tonight
Its another round in the losing fight
Out along the great divide tonight
We are aging soldiers in an ancient war
Seeking out some half remembered shore
We drink our fill and still we thirst for more
Asking if theres no heaven what is this hunger for
Our path is worn our feet are poorly shod
We lift up our prayer against the odds
And fear the silence is the voice of God
And we cry Allelujah Allelujah
We cry Allelujah
Sorrow is constant and the joys are brief
The seasons come and bring no sweet relief
Time is a brutal but a careless thief
Who takes our lot but leaves behind the grief
It is the heart that kills us in the end
Just one more old broken bone that cannot mend
As it was now and ever shall be amen
And we cry Allelujah Allelujah
We cry Allelujah
So therell be no guiding light for you and me
We are not sailors lost out on the sea
We were always headed toward eternity
Hoping for a glimpse of Gaililee
Like falling stars from the universe we are hurled
Down through the long loneliness of the world
Until we behold the pain become the pearl
Cryin Allelujah Allelujah
We cry Allelujah
And we cry Allelujah Allelujah
We cry AllelujahIn South Carolina there are many tall pines
I remember the oak tree that we used to climb
But now when Im lonesome I always pretend
That Im getting the feel of hickory wind
I started out younger at most everything
All the riches and pleasures what else could life bring
But it makes me feel better each time it begins
Callin me home hickory wind
Its hard way to find out that trouble is real
In a far away city with a far away feel
But it makes me feel better each time it begins
Callin me home hickory wind
Keeps callin me home hickory windMe and my best friend Lillian
And her blue tick hound dog Gideon
Sittin on the front porch cooling in the shade
Singin every song the radio played
Waitin for the Alabama sun to go down
Two red dirt girls in a red dirt town
Me and Lillian
Just across the line and a little southeast of Meridian
She loved her brother I remember back when
He was fixin up a forty-nine Indian
He told her Little sister gonna ride the wind
Up around the moon and back again
He never got farther than Vietnam
I was standin there with her when the telegram come
For Lillian
Now hes lyin somewhere about a million miles from Meridian
She said theres not much hope for a red dirt girl
Somewhere out there is a great big world
Thats where Im bound
And the stars might fall on Alabama
But one of these days Im gonna swing
My hammer down
Away from this red dirt town
Im gonna make a joyful sound
She grew up tall and she grew up thin
Buried that old dog Gideon
By a crepe myrtle bush in the back of the yard
Her daddy turned mean and her mama leaned hard
Got in trouble with a boy from town
Figured that she might as well settle down
So she dug right in
Across a red dirt line just a little south east from Meridian
She tried hard to love him but it never did take
It was just another way for the heart to break
So she dug right in
But one thing they dont tell you about the blues
When you got em
You keep on falling cause there aint no bottom
There aint know end
At least not for Lillian
Nobody knows when she started her skid
She was only twenty seven and she had five kids
Coulda been the whiskey
Coulda been the pills
Coulda been the dream she was trying to kill
But there wont be a mention in the news of the world
About the life and the death of a red dirt girl
Names Lillian
Who never got any farther across the line than Meridian
Now the stars still fall on Alabama
Tonight she finally laid
That hammer down
Without a sound
In the red dirt groundThe sun burned hot it burned my eyes
Burned so hot I thought Id died
Thought Id died and gone to Hell
Lookin for the water from a deeper well
I went to the river but the river was dry
I fell to my knees and I looked to the sky
I looked to the sky and the spring rain fell
I saw the water from a deeper well
Well lookin for the water from a deeper well
Well lookin for the water from a deeper well
I was ready for love I was ready for the money
Ready for the blood and ready for the honey
Ready for the winnin ready for the bell
Lookin for the water from a deeper well
I found some love and I found some money
Found that blood would drip from the honey
Found I had a thirst that I could not quell
Lookin for the water from a deeper well
Well lookin for the water from a deeper well
Well lookin for the water from a deeper well
Well I did it for kicks and I did it for faith
I did it for lust and I did it for hate
I did it for need and I did it for love
Addiction stayed on tight like a glove
So I ran with the moon and I ran with the night
And the three of us were a terrible sight
Nipple to the bottle to the gun to the cell
To the bottom of a hole of a deeper well
Well lookin for the water from a deeper well
Well lookin for the water from a deeper well
I rocked with the cradle and I rolled with the rage
I shook those walls and I rattled that gage
I took my trouble down a dead-end trail
Reachin out a hand for a holier grail
Hey there mama did you carry that load
Did you tell your baby bout the bend in the road
Bout the rebel yell bout the one that fell
Lookin for the water from a deeper well
Well lookin for the water from a deeper well
Well lookin for the water from a deeper wellHank Williams died when I was five
He sang Ill never get out of this world alive
Now its been a long time since I was that kid
And Ive seen a lot more than Hank ever did
Ive done the down and out in every dark end dive
But Ill never get out of your love alive
Sam Cook met the woman at the well
She told him that his song was something he could never sell
And I think he knew a change was gonna come
Still he lived too fast and he died too young
Well dyin young I have survived but Ill never get out of your love alive
I got washed in the blood of Bill Monroe
When he sang about the the blues in the body and soul
He believed in a God that could raise the dead
Still its a mighty dark night to travel he said
Ive seen a mighty dark night and I made that drive
But Ill never get out of your love aliveNew Jersy Woman
New Jersy Woman
New Jersy WomanRodney Crowell
You looked for trouble and you found it son
Straight down the barrel of a lawmans gun
Youd try to run but you dont think you can
You make one move and youre dead man friend
I aint living long like this
I cant live at all like this can I baby
He slipped the handcuffs on behind my back
Then he left me freezing on a steel rail track
They got em all in the jailhouse aint they bay
I aint living long like this
Grew up in Houston off of Wayside drive
Son of a charhop in some all night dive
Dad drove a stock car to an early death
All I remember was a drunk mans death
I aint living long like this
I cant live at all like this can I baby
We know the story how the wheel goes round
Dont let em take you to the man downtown
Cant sleep at all in the jailhouse baby
I aint living long like this
You live for angel shes a roadhouse queen
Make Texas ruby look like Sandra Dee
You want to love her but you dont know how
Youre at the bottom of the jailhouse now
I aint living long like this
I cant live at all like this can I baby
You know the story bout the jailhouse rock
Go on and do it but just dont get caught
They got em all in the jailhouse aint they baby
I aint living long like thisI have seen your soul turn black
And then retreat
To that dark place where no one else may follow
I waited here for your returning
To roll your cigarette
And wash your bloodied feet
You have heard the silent running
Of my dreams
Broke me from the grip of grief and fever
With the sound of your voice speaking my name
And a kiss
That I will feel forever
In the hour of gold the hour of lead
WG did forge our wedding bed
On a hard and holy road
We lay down our head
In tha hour of gold the hour oi lead
I have watched you riding on
The wall of death
And when il finally breaks you and you fall
I will tear this dress of muslin that you gave me
To bind the fatal wound
And catch your last sweet breath
In the hour of gold the hour of lead
We did forge our wedding bed
On a hard and holy road
We lay down our head
In the hour of gold the hour of lead
But the world will be my witness when
They excavate my heart
And find the image of your face
Imprinted there like some Shroud of Turin
That neither time Nor tundra could erase
In the hour of gold the hour of lead
We did forge our wedding bed
On a hard and holy road
We lay down our head
In the hour of gold the hour of leadGod knows how I love you
Like a user needs a drug
And Ill never be free of ya
You are poison in my blood
I tried to swim that river
And get to higher ground
I been three times under
The next onell see me drown
But I dont want to talk about it now
I dont want to talk about it now
I dont want to talk about it now
I want to go down
God knows why you dont want me
No one would do the things I do
But to my grave its gonna haunt me
How I got down on my knees for you
You are my obsession
And the reason that I live
You alreday got my soul
Theres nothin left to give
But I dont want to talk about it now
I dont want to talk about it now
I dont want to talk about it now
I want to go down
The devil is deep water baby
And Im in way over my head
But Id be drawn and quartered
If I could keep you in my bed
I cant break this spell
I know the trouble that Im in
But If I got out of the mouth of hell
Id walk right back again
But I dont want to talk about it now
I dont want to talk about it now
I dont want to talk about it now
I want to go downI hear the sound of sorrow in the wind
Blowing down from every mile Ive ever been
Calling me out on some road that just wont end
Where the sweetheart rides the rodeo again
A thousand nights a thousand towns I took the bows
But there is no compensation for me now
Out along the highway where the west was won
No matter how fast I ride or far I run
Waiting for the sweetheart of the rodeo
Theyre comin down from Tonopah to Tupelo
Shell come to town to ride the radio
Like shes slidin down the walls of Jericho
There goes the sweetheart of the rodeo
I stepped into the light you left behind
I stood there where all the world could see me shine
Oh I was on my way to you to make you mine
But I took the longest road that I could findClose your eyes close the door
You dont have to worry anymore
Ill be your baby tonight
Shut the light shut the shade
Oh you dont have to be afraid
Ill be your baby tonight
Oh well that mockingbird is gonna sail away
Were gonna forget it
And that big fat moon is gonna shine like a spoon
But were gonna let it you wont regret it
Kick your shoes off do not fear
Oh bring that bottle over here
Ill be your baby tonight
Oh well that mockingbird is gonna sail away
Were gonna forget it
And that big fat moons gonna shine like a spoon
But were gonna let it you wont regret it
Kick your shoes off do not fear
Oh bring that bottle over here
Ill be your baby tonight
Ill be your baby tonightSpanish is a loving tongue
Soft as music light as spray
Was a girl he learned it from
Living down Sonora way
He dont look much like a lover
But he says her love words over
Mostly when hes all alone
Mi amor mi corazon
On the nights that he would ride
She would listen for his spurs
Throw those big doors open wide
Raise them laughing eyes of hers
How those hours would get to flying
All too soon hed hear her sighing
In her little sorry tone
Mi amor mi corazon
He aint seen her since that night
He cant cross the line you know
They want him for a gamblin fight
Like as not its better so
Yet hes always sort of missed her
Since that last sad night he kissed her
Lost his heart left her own
Adios mi corazon
Lost his heart left her own
Adios mi corazonLife is just a passing moment
On an never ending trail
Though my pathway wanders for a heart
Someday my ship will sail
But I will walk this road awhile
And I will walk it with a smile
I will take it in my stride
Someday Ill be satisfied
Theres eternity before me
Just beyond the darkening veil
O my spirit hollers to go on
Someday my ship will sail
But I will walk this road awhile
And I will walk it with a smile
I will take it in my stride
Someday Ill be satisfied
Someday Ill be satisfiedIts over our love affair
Too late now I find I care
His sweet love no more Ill share
Now hes gone Im alone
I was wrong should have known
Took me home on our last date
I search for a single way
To tell him what I had to say
I kissed him watched him walk away
Set him free foolishly destiny misery
Tragedy on our last date
Took the ring from my trembling fingers
Brushed a tear from my babys eye
Walked away didnt know
That Id soon miss him so
Guess I was too young to realize
So blind I couldnt see
How much he really meant to me
And that soon he would always be
On my mind in my heart I was blind from the start
Lost his love on our last dateTheres a land beyond the river that we call the sweet forever
And we only reach that shore by faith you see
Yes i want to see my jesus
Shake his hand and have him great us
When they ring those golden bells for you and me
Dont you hear the bells a-ringin
Cant you hear the angels singin
Its a glory hallelujah jubilee
In the far off great forever just beyond the shining river
When they ring those golden bells for you and me
When our days have known their number
When in death we sweetly slumber
When the kingdom mends the spirit to be free
Therell be no more stormy weather
Well live peacefully together
When they ring those golden bells for you and me
Dont you hear the bells a-ringin
Cant you hear the angels singin
Its a glory hallelujah jubilee
In the far off great forever just beyond the shining river
When they ring those golden bells for you and me
When they ring those golden bells for you and meShe came on to him like a slow moving cold front
His beer was warmer that the look in her eye
She sat on the stool and she said What do you want
She said Give me a love that dont freeze up inside
He said I have melted some hearts in my time dear
But to sit next to you Lord I shiver and shake
And if I knew love well I dont think Id be here
Askin myself if I had what it takes
To melt your icy blue heart
Should I start to turn whats been frozen for years
Into a river of tears
These days we all play cool calm and collected
Our lips could turn blue just shooting the breeze
But under the frost wee thought he detected
A warm blush of red and the touch of her knee
He said youre a beauty like Ive never witnessed
And Ive seen the northern lights dance in the air
Ive felt the cold that can follow the first kiss
And theres not enough heat in the fires burning there
To melt your icy blue heart
Should I start to turn whats been frozen for years
Into a river of tears
To melt your icy blue heartWho can tell just how it starts
Angry words and broken hearts
Till silently we sit apart
You and I
But in awhile the angers gone
And we forget whos right or wrong
Then one of us will end it all
With just a smile
We believe in happy endings
Never breaking
Only bending
Taking time enough for mending
The hurt inside
We believe in new beginnings
Giving in
And forgiving
We believe happy endings
You and I
Just a word is all it takes
And so it pass
The silence breaks
And looking back it makes us ache
For what weve done
And so we cling together now
And wonder why were oh so proud
When all that matters anyhow
Is our love
We believe in happy endings
Never breaking
Only bending
Taking time enough for mending
The hurt inside
We believe in new beginnings
Giving in
And forgiving
We believe in happy endings
You and II hear a call
Now will answer
Forsake my all
To serve another
Though darkness falls
Stay a believer
I hear a call
Now will answer
I see a light Now will I follow
Fill up this life
That grows more hollow
Make joy reside
Where there lives sorrow
I see a light
Now will follow
I hear a call
From out of nowhere
And from anywhere I go
I hear a call
Now will answer
I feel a touch
Now will I hold on
Be there with love
For those with no one
With a kindness such
It lives though Im gone
I feel a touch
Now will I hold onWeve been through some things together
With trunks of memories still to come
We found things to do in stormy weather
Long may you run
Long may you run
Long may you run
Although these changes have come
With your chrome heart shining in the sun
Long may you run
Well it was back in Blind River in one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-two
When I last saw you alive
Rollin down that empty ocean road
Gettin to the surf on time
Long may you run
Long may you run
Although these changes have come
With your chrome heart shining in the sun
Long may you run
Long may you run
Long may you runWell goodness is it really real
It would take a baby child to know the way I feel
On my flutter in the blue
I would take the credit but its thanks to you
Ooh yeah Im a sinner and
I aint some beginner
Ill uncork a pint of trouble
Sit down and drink a double
Im thirsty for somethin lighter
Thatll get me even tighter
And tighter until one day
I think I hear angels play
Well goodness is it really real
It would take a baby child to know the way I feel
On my flutter in the blue
I would take the credit but its thanks to you
Now someday up in glory
Well Ill weep and tell the story
To someone who will smile and say
Youre a mess but youre my child

On my flutter in the blue
I would take the credit but its thanks to youWell its only rock and roll keep you running from yourself
When the only way to slow down is to fall
And its only rock and roll that caused you to leave home
When the only way to get back is to crawl
But the record people love you they can get you on the bill
Change your name to money dress up fit to kill
People all around you everywhere you go
Dont worry if they love you son its only rock and roll
Yes and its only rock and roll keep you jumping all the time
When you really ought to sit this one out
And its only rock and roll keep on messin with your mind when

Its only rock and roll yes its only rock and roll
People all around you everywhere you go

And your loves on the back of the bus

Another long lonesome day
Youll have to live without him
The morning seemed to say
Another lonesome morning
You thought you didnt care
But morning breezes find you
Wishing he were there
Come way
Sing this same
Old song
Trying hard to please
And you hear the sounds
That he used to love
Through the rustling of the leaves
Through the rustling of the leaves
Your losing him has taught you
That wanted him to stay
And you now that all another
Lonesome morning brings
Is another lonesome day
Oh another lonesome day
Is another lonesome day
Is another lonesome daySomewhere theres music how faint the tune
Somewhere theres heaven how high the moon
There is no moon above and love is far away too
Till it comes true
That you love me and I love you
Somewhere theres music how near how far
Somewhere theres heaven thats where you are
Chorus
The darkest night would shine if you would come to me soon
Until you will Ill still my heart how high the moon
Somewhere theres music how faint the tune
Somewhere theres heaven how high the moonIve been running low on inspiration
Tired of that physical intrigue
Theres nothing left to imagination
Living in a world that treats love so carelessly
Dont want no smooth talkin lover
I cant play the role
It just leaves me cold
I need a high powered love
I wanna feel that lightning streak
High powered love
Got to be down in the heart with me
Sometimes its hard to keep believing
Too many pretty faces all skin deep
Is there anyone left with teeth just a little uneven
And wont spend more time with a mirror than me
If youre just looking for a good time
A notch on your gun
I aint the one
I want a high powered love
Got to have intensity
High powered love
Dont start the fire if you cant take the heat
I cant turn back Im on a mission
I know theres someone out there for me
I need a high powered love
One thatll defy gravity
High powered love
Got to be strong and keep on lifting me
Higher higher higher
Higher higher higher
High powered love
High powered love

Aint it hard when you wake up in the morning
And you find out that those other days are gone
All you have is memories of happiness
Lingerin on
You might wonder who can I turn to
On this cold and chilly night of gloom
The answer to that question
Is nowhere in this room
All your dreams and your lovers wont protect you
Theyre only passing through you in the end
Theyll leave you stripped of all that they can get to
And wait for you to come back again
You might wonder who I can turn to
On this cold and chilly night of gloom
The answer to that question
Is nowhere in this roomGo to sleep you little babe
Go to sleep you little babe
Your mamas gone away and your daddys gonna stay
Didnt leave nobody but the baby
Go to sleep you little babe
Go to sleep you little babe
Everybodys gone in the cotton and the corn
Didnt leave nobody but the baby
Youre sweet little babe
Youre sweet little babe
Honey in the rock and the sugar dont stop
Gonna bring a bottle to the baby
Dont you weep pretty babe
Dont you weep pretty babe
Shes long gone with her red shoes on
Gonna need another lovin baby
Go to sleep you little babe
Go to sleep you little babe
You and me and the Devil makes three
Dont need no other lovin baby
Go to sleep you little babe
Go to sleep you little babe
Come and lay your bones on the alabaster stones
And be my ever-lovin babyWont you scratch my itch sweet Annie Rich
And welcome me back to town
Come out on your porch or Ill step into your parlour
And Ill show you how it all went down
Out with the truckers and the kickers and the cowboy angels
And a good saloon in every single town
Oh and I remember something you once told me
And Ill be damned if it did not come true
Twenty thousand roads I went down down down
And they all lead me straight back home to you
Cause I headed West to grow up with the country
Across those prairies with those waves of grain
And I saw my devil and I saw my deep blue sea
And I thought about a calico bonnet from Cheyenne to Tennessee
We flew straight across that river bridge last night half past two
The switch-man wave his lantern goodbye and good day as we went roling through
Billboards and truck stops pass by the grievous angel
And now I know just what I have to do pick for me James
And the man on the radio wont leave me alone
He wants to take my money for something that Ive never been shown
And I saw my devil and I saw my deep blue see
And I thought about a calico bonnet from Cheyenne to Tennessee
The news I could bring I met up with the king
On his head an amphetamine crown
He talked about unbuckling that old bible belt
And lighted out for some desert town
Out with the truckers and the kickers and the cowboy angels
And a good saloon in every single town
Oh but I remember something you once told me
And Ill be damned if it did not come true
Twenty thousand roads I went down down down
And they all lead me straight back home to you
Twenty thousand roads I went down down down
And they all lead me straight back home to youYou call me from a phone booth with tears in your voice
Tell me youve been out all night runnin with the boys
You say youre cold and tired and lonely
And you got no place to go
There wasnt any phonebook
Mines the only number that you know
Well call yourself a taxi and Ill pay Im at the door
If you dont mind sleepin on the sofa or on the floor
And I spend an hour hatin you
Til the cab pulls in
My heart has found another way
To be loving you again
And every time is the last time
And every time is the first
Everytime is the last time with you
Oh it never gets no better
And it couldnt get no wore
Then I hear the footsteps the drivers at the door
He says I look familiar has he made this run before
And I tell him I dont think so
Whats it matter anyway
Just tell me what the meter reads
And Ill go and get your pay
Well now its down to you and me though it dont seem right
We both know where well be and what well do tonight
And after an hour or two
When the night comes to an end
My heart has found another way
To be lovin you again
And every time is the last time
And every time is the first
Everytime is the last time with you
Oh it never gets no better
And it couldnt get no worse
I know that there should be more to say Ill just reed your mind
Lets save whats left unsaid for another time
Cause I know therell be another time
So until then
My heart has found another way
To be lovin you again
My heart has found another way
To be lovin you again
Oh my heart has found another way
To be lovin you againLeonard Cohen
Say a prayer for the cowgirl her horse ran away
Shell walk til she finds him her darlin her stray
But the rivers in flood and the roads are awash
And the bridges break up in the panic of loss
And theres nothin to follow nowhere to go
Hes gone like the summer gone like the snow
And the crickets are breaking her heart with their song
As the day caves in and the night is all wrong
Did she dream it was he who went galloping past
And bent down the fern broke open the grass
And printed the mud with the well-hammered shoe
That she nailed to his speed in the dreams of her youth
And although he goes grazin a minute away
She tracks him all night she tracks him all day
And shes blind to his presence except to compare
Her injury here with his punishment there
Then at home on a branch on a high stream
A songbird sings out so suddenly
And the sun is warm and the soft winds ride
On a willow tree by the riverside
An the world is sweet and world is wide
And hes there where the light and the darkness divide
And the steams comin off him hes huge and hes shy
And he steps on the moon when he paws at the sky
And he comes to her hand but hes nor really tame
He longs to be lost she longs for the same
And hell bolt and hell plunge thru the first open pass
To roll and to feed in the sweet mountain grass
Or hell make a break for the high plateau
Where theres nothing above and noting below
Its time for their burden the whip and the spur
Will she ride with him or will he ride with her
So she binds herself to her galloping steed
And he binds himself to the woman in need
And there is no space just left and right
And there is no time but there is day and night
Then she learns on his neck and whispers low
Whither thou goest I will go
And they turn as one the head for the plain
No need for the whip oh no need for the rein
Now the clasp of this union who fastens it tight
Who snaps it asunder the very next night
Some say its him some say its her
Some say loves like smoke beyond all repair
So my darlin my darlin just let go by
That old silhouette on the great western sky
And Ill pick out a tune and theyll move right along
And theyre gone like smoke and theyre gone like this song
Say a prayer for the cowgirlRodney Crowell
This morning is Monday where are you now
Teasin my memory teaching me how to lay low
When I dont want to
Well love is elusive this I know now
Its making me crazy leaving me out
In the open when I dont want to
The moments of pleasures Never do last
Are gone like a suitcase full of your past
Long gone and in a hurry
Baby I cant go through this again
I dont need to go down more then Ive already been
Just like a wild fire youre running all over town
As much as you burn me baby I should be ashes by now
The second street beggars alone in their life
Drunk on a sidewalk to hide from the night
Like I am Theyre just like I am
Baby I cant go through this again
I dont need to go down more then Ive already been
Just like a wild fire youre running all over town
As much as you burn me baby I should be ashes by now
Just like a wild fire Youre running all over town
As much as you burn me baby I should be ashes by now
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah I should be ashes by nowRoom sixteen the palms motel
Now I can rest behind that door
My life with yous become a living hell
Dont want to live like that no more
And whatever it will take
I will do to make this final break
Yeah better off without you
Better off without you
Better off without you in my life
So Ill unpack my bag
And kick off these old shoes
This room is a good as anyplace Ive ever been
For lookin at the truth
Now its all so clear to me
What a blind man could plainly see
Yeah better off without you
Better off without you
Better off without you in my life
Oh god here comes the tears
Im gonna stay right here
Ill cry Ive cried before
But I wont go back no more
Looks like a change in the weather
I can hear it start to rain
I hope its not too long this time
Before the sun comes out again
But if it rains forever
I will still be better off
Yeah better off without you
Better off without you
Better off without you in my lifeIf you were a bluebird youd be a sad one
Id give you a true word
But youve already had one
If you were a bluebird
Youd be crying
Youd be flying home
If you were a raindrop
Youd shine like a rainbow
And if you were a train stop
The conductor would sing low
If you were a raindrop
Youd be falling
Youd be calling home
If you were a hotel
Honey youd be a grand one
But if you hit a slow spell
Do you think you could stand one
If you were a hotel
Well Id lean on your doorbell
Id call you my home
If I was a highway
Id stretch alongside you
Id help you pass by ways
That had dissatisfied you
If I was a highway
Well Id be stretchin
Id be fetchin you homeI was dancin with my darlin to the Tennessee Waltz
When an old friend I happened to see
I introduced him to my darlin and while they were dancin
My friend stole my sweetheart from me
I remember the night and the Tennessee Waltz
Now I know just how much I have lost
Yes I lost my little darlin the night they were playin
That beautiful Tennessee Waltz
Now I wonder how a dance like the Tennessee Waltz
Could have broken my heart so complete
Well I couldnt blame my darlin and who could help fallin
In love with my darlin so sweet
Well it must be the fault of the Tennessee Waltz
Wish Id known just how much it would cost
But I didnt see it comin its all over but the cryin
Blame it all on the Tennessee Waltz
She goes dancin with the darkness to the Tennessee Waltz
And I feel like Im falling apart
And its stronger than drink and its deeper than sorrow
This darkness she left in my heart
I remember the night and the Tennessee Waltz
Cause I know just how much I have lost
Yes I lost my little darlin the night they were playin
That beautiful Tennessee WaltzDarkness falls and you withdraw
Your humour disappears
Its been this way for years
Its nothing new
Come around and dont look down
Youll never see the sun
Youll never see the one
Whos loving you
Youve got to hold your head up darling
Never let them see
When youre sad you look a lot like me
Youve got to want to win my darling
Or youre bound to lose
I wish for once that I could bring you good news good news
Now I dont care for sad affairs
The outcomes up to you
If tears are overdue then let them fall
Come around and dont look down
Youll never see the sun
Youll never see the one
Whos loving you
Youve got to hold your head up darling
Never let them see
When youre sad you look a lot like me
Youve got to want to win my darling
Or youre bound to lose
I wish for once that I could bring you good news good news
Youve got to want to win my darling
Or youre bound to lose
I wish for once that I could bring you good news good news
Good newsDavid Olney
Man you should have seen me way back then
I could tell a tale I could make a spin
I could tell you black was white I could tell you day was night
Not only that I could tell you why
Back then I could really tel a lie
Well Id hire a kid to say he was lame
Then Id touch him and make him walk again
Then Id pull some magic trick Id pretend to heal the sick
I was takin everything they had to give
It wasnt all that bad a way to live
Well Im in this desert town and its hot as hell
But no ones buyin what I got to sell
I make my lame kid walk I make a dumb guy talk
Im preachin up a storm both night and day
But everyone just turns and walks away
Well I can see that Im only wasting time
So I head across the road to drink some wine
This old man comes up to me He says I seen you on the street
Youre pretty good if I do say myself
But the guy that come thru here last month he was somethin else
Instead of callin out for fire from above
He just gets real quiet and talks about love
And Ill tell you somethin funny He didnt want nobodys money
Now Im not exactly sure what this all means
But its the damndest thing I swear Ive ever seen
Well since that time every town is the same
I cant make a dime I dont know why I came
I decide Ill go and find him And find out whos behind him
He has everyone convinced that hes for real
Well I figure we can work us out a deal
So he offers me a job and I say fine
He says Ill get paid off on down the line
Well I guess Ill string along Dont see how too much can go wrong
As long as he pays my way I guess Ill follow
Were headed for Jerusalem tomorrowBruce Springsteen
Well its Saturday night
Youre all dressed up and blue
Ive been watchin you go out
Maybe you been watchin me too
So somebody ran out
Left somebodys heart in a mess
Well if youre lookin for love
Honey Im tougher than the rest
Some girls they want a handsome Dan
Or some good-lookin Joe
On their arms some girls want
A sweet talkin Romeo
Well round here baby
Ive learned you get what you can get
So if youre rough enough for love
Honey Im tougher than the rest
Yeah the road is dark
And its a thin thin line
But I want you to know
Ill walk it for you anytime
Maybe your other girlfriends
Couldnt pass the test
Well if youre rough and ready for love
Honey Im tougher than the restJai fait tout jai fait tout

And if you want a witness
I will testify
To what I saw through a wandering eye
Cause nobody loves you like I do
Nobody loves you like I do
Nobody loves you like I do
Nobody loves you like I do

I hear the clock a tickin
See the sweat upon my brow
I know my destination
Nothings gonna stop me now
Im running on desire
Baby Ive got nerves of steel
Coming down to the wire
Lord above me guide the wheel
Keep me in your prayers tonight
Ill be weary upon that road
I know the finish lines in sight
But I still have a ways to go
Theres a junkyard dog a barkin
In the valley down below
Hes wanting me to stop and
Gather up a heavy load
Aint gonna heed his call
Aint givin him the time of day
You mangy mutt once and for all
I said I threw that stuff away
I wont have a bit of trouble
Heading down the straight and true
Ill fly solo on the double
Into the yonder blue
I might need some intervention
Out upon the icy turn
In a foggy situation
Squealin on a hairpin curve
Im running on desire
Baby Ive got nerves of steel
Coming down to the wire
Lord above me guide the wheel
Keep me in your prayers tonight
Ill be weary upon that road
I know the finish lines in sight
But I still have a ways to go
Keep me in your prayers tonight
Ill be weary upon that road
I know the finish lines in sight
But I still have a ways to go
Got a ways to go got a ways to goI see a bad moon rising
I see trouble on the way
I see earthquakes and lighting
I see bad times today
Now dont go round tonight
For its bound to take your life
Theres a bad moon on the rise
I hear hurricanes a blowing
I know the end is comin soon
I fear the rivers overflowing
I hear the voice of rage and ruin
I hope you have got your things together
Hope you are quite prepared to die

Baby better start turnin em down
Baby better start turninThe sun is slowly sinkin
The days almost gone
Still darkness falls around us
And we must journey on
The darkest hour is just before dawn
The narrow way leads home
Lay down your soul at Jesus feet
The darkest hour is just before dawn
Like a shepherd out on the mountain
A-watchin the sheep down below
Hes coming back to claim us
Will you be ready to go
The darkest hour is just before dawn
The narrow way leads home
Lay down your soul
Let Jesus in
The darkest hour is just before dawn
The darkest hour is just before dawnI crossed on the river
Therell be no returning
I crossed all the bridges
I watched them all burning
And now Im a stranger
To a strange land Im driven
Where all is forgotten
And nothings forgiven
But I cried a river
A river for him
Thats deeper and wider
Than Ill ever swim
The heart it will harden
The sorrow will dim
But I cried a river
A river for him
I think of him now
On the road I am taking
And wonder how long
His heart will be breaking
But hell never hear when
The teardrops are falling
Or the sound of my voice
And the name Im calling
But I cried a river
A river for him
Thats deeper and wider
Than Ill ever swim
The heart it will harden
The sorrow will dim
But I cried a river
A river for himWe used to have good times together
But now I feel them slip away
It makes me cry to see love die
So sad to watch good love go bad
Remember how you used to feel dear
You said nothing could change your mind
It breaks my heart to see us part
So sad to watch good love go bad
Is it any wonder that I feel so blue
When I know for certain that Im losing you
It breaks my heart to see us part
So sad to watch good love go bad
So sad to watch good love go badI want em I need em

Last night I dreamed that I was a child
Out where the pines grow wild and tall
I was trying to make it home through the forest
Before the darkness falls
I heard the wind rustling through the trees
And ghostly voices rose from the fields
I ran with my heart pounding down that broken path
With the devil snappin at my heels
I broke through the trees and there in the night
My fathers house stood shining hard and bright
The branches and brambles tore my clothes and scratched my arms
But I ran till I fell shaking in his arms
I awoke and I imagined the hard things that pulled us apart
Will never again sir tear us from each others hearts
I got dressed and to that house I did ride
From out on the road I could see its windows shining in light
I walked up the steps and stood on the porch
A woman I didnt recognize came and spoke to me through a chained door
I told her my story and who Id come for
She said Im sorry son but no one by that name lives here anymore
My fathers house shines hard and bright
It stands like a beacon calling me in the night
Calling and calling so cold and alone
Shining cross this dark highway where our sins lie unatonedMary took to running with a travelin man
Left her momma crying with her head in her hands
Such a sad case so broken hearted
She say momma I got to go I gotta get outta here
I gotta get out of town Im tired of hanging around
I gotta roll on between the ditches
Its just an ordinary story bout the way things go
Round and around nobody knows but the highway
Goes on forever that ol highway rolls on forever
Lord she never wouldve done it if she hadnt got drunk
If she hadnt started running with a travelin man
If she hadnt started taking those crazy changes
She say daughter let me tell you bout the travelin kind
Everywhere hes goin such a very short time
Hell be long gone before you know it hell be long
Gone before you know it
She say never have I known it when it felt so good
Never have I knew it when I knew I could
Never have I done it when it looked so right
Leaving Louisiana in the broad daylight
This is down in the swampland anything goes
Its alligator bait and the bars dont close
Its the real thing down in Louisiana
Did you ever see a cajun when he really got mad
When he really got trouble like a daughter gone bad
It gets real hot down in Louisiana
The stranger better move it or hes gonna get killed
Hes gonna have to get it or a shotgun will
It aint no time for lengthy speeches
There aint no time for lengthy speeches
She say never have I know it when it felt so good
Never have I knew it when I knew I could
Never have I done it when it looked so right
Leaving Louisiana in the broad daylight
Its just an ordinary story bout the way things go
Round and around nobody knows but the highway goes on forever
There aint no way to stop the waterHello stranger
Put your loving hand in mine
You are a stranger
And youre a friend of mine
Get up rounder
Let a working girl lay down
You are a rounder
And youre all out and down
Every time
I ride the four and six street cars
I can see my baby
Peeping through the bars
He bowed his head
And he waved both hands at me
Hes prison bound
And longing to be free
Ill see you
When your troubles are like mine
Yes Ill see you
When you havent got a dimeIn the time of my confession in the hour of my deepest need
When the pool of tears beneath my feet flood every newborn seed
Theres a dyin voice within me reaching out somewhere
Toiling in the danger and in the morals of despair
Dont have the inclination to look back on any mistake
Like cain I now behold this chain of events that I must break
In the fury of the moment I can see the masters hand
In every leaf that trembles and in every grain of sand
Oh the flowers of indulgence and the weeds of yesteryear
Like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer
The sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way
To ease the pain of idleness and the memory of decay
I gaze into the doorway of temptations angry flame
And every time I pass that way I always hear my name
Then onward in my journey I come to understand
That every hair is numbered like every grain of sand
I have gone from rags to riches in the sorrow of the night
In the violence of a summers dream in the chill of a wintry light
In the bitter dance of loneliness fading into space
In the broken mirror of innocence on each forgotten face
I hear the ancient footsteps like the motion of the sea
Sometimes I turn theres someone there other times its only me
I am hanging in the balance of a perfect finished plan
Like every sparrow falling like every grain of sandIm growing tired on the big city lights
Tired of the glamor and tired of the sights
In all my dreams I am roaming once more
Back to my home on the old river shore
I am sad and weary far away from home
Miss the Mississippi and you
Days are dark and dreary
Everywhere I go
Miss the Mississippi and you
Roaming the wide world over
Always along and blue
Nothing seems to cheer me under Heavens door
Miss the Mississippi and you
Im growing tired on the big city lights
Tired of the glamor and tired of the sights
In all my dreams I am roaming once more
Back to my home on the old river shore
I am sad and weary far away from home
Miss the Mississippi and you
Days are dark and dreary
Everywhere I go
Miss the Mississippi and you
Mississippi and youI dont belong to no one
I dont belong at all
Got my face in the corner
Got my back to the wall
And pretty baby Im restless restless
Restless through and through
Im restless restless
You look restless too
Im a hair trigger lover
And I cant face up to nothing
Im impatient with the wind
But Im waitin here for somethin
And pretty baby Im restless restless
Restless through and through
Im restless restless
You look restless too
Restless sleep twisted dreams
Moving targets silent screams
Restless city restless street
Restless you restless me
Im a face at the window
Im a black satin sheet
And I cant stay warm
I stay out in the street
And pretty baby Im restless restless
Restless through and through
Im restless restless
You look restless tooGulf coast highway he worked the rails
He worked the rice fields with their cold dark wells
He worked the oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico
The only thing weve owned is this old house here by the road
And when he dies he says hell catch some blackbirds wing
And we will fly away to heaven
Come some sweet blue bonnet spring
She walked through springtime when I was home
The days were sweet our nights were warm
The seasons changed the jobs would come
The flowers fade and this old house felt so alone
When the work took me away
And when she dies she says shell catch some blackbirds wing
And she will fly away to heaven
Come some sweet blue bonnet spring
Highway ninety the jobs are gone
We kept our garden we set the sun
This is the only place on Earth blue bonnets grow
And once a year they come and go
At this old house here by the road
And when we die we say well catch some blackbirds wing
And we will fly away to heaven
Come some sweet blue bonnet spring
Yes when we die we say well catch some blackbirds wing
And we will fly away together
Come some sweet blue bonnet springCastles tall

But oh baby let me tell you
I got a thing about you
Baby let me tell you
I got a thing about you
It dont matter what you say
It dont matter what you do
I I I got a thing about you
Somewhere deep in the middle of the night
Lovers hold each other tight
Whisper in their anxious ears
Words of love that disappear
ChorusHe was always there each time I needed you
Holding on to me like I held on to you
We still dont have what you and I once had
No Its Not Love But its not bad
No Its Not Love not like our love Its Not Love
But it keeps love from driving me mad
And I dont have to wonder who hes had
No Its Not Love But its not bad
I turn to him when you leave me alone
Sometimes even when youre here youre still gone
Hee slowly changing what you leave so sad
No Its Not Love But its not bad
No Its Not Love not like our love Its Not Love
But it keeps love from driving me mad
And I dont have to wonder who hes hadPraise God I feel like singing
Im on the other side of life now
All my days of sorrow
And tears for my loved ones
I wish I could tell them the door that I feel
Though my body is weary
My soul is uplifted
My sins are forgiven and my Jesus is real
Praise God I feel like singing
Im on the other side of life now
Though my eyes are dim
I see Heaven clearly
Though my voice grows feeble I sing just the same
In my heart theres a song
As I see the gates open
Ill sing forever my joyous refrainEvery night I dream about him
In my world of fantasy
I pretend that were together
In his world theres a garden in the moonlight
In his world theres a sweet and gentle breeze
In his world oh he tells me that he loves me
Thats where my heart wants to be
I saw a star falls from the heaven
I hope the wish I made comes true
I dont want to live without him
In his world I can see a new tomorrow
In his world where he gives his heart to me
In his world we will share this love together
Thats where my heart wants to be
Why must I go on pretending
Why cant I tell him how I feel
These sweet dreams are never ending
And this loneliness is real
I saw a star fall from the heavens
I hope the wish I made comes true
I dont want to live without him
In his world I can see a new tomorrow
In his world where he gives his heart to me
In his world we will share this love together
Thats where my heart wants to beBruce Springsteen
You make up your mind you choose the chance you take
You ride to where the highway ends and the desert breaks
Out on through an open road you ride until the day
You learn to sleep at night with the price you pay
Now with their hands held high they reached out for the open skies
And then with their last breath
They built the roads they would ride to their deaths
Driving on through the night unable to break away
From the restless pull of the price you pay
Oh the price you pay oh the price you pay
Now you cant walk away from the price you pay
Now theyve come so far and theyve waited so long
Just to end up caught in a dream where everything goes wrong
Where the dark of night holds back the light of the day
And you gotta stand and fight for the price you pay
Oh the price you pay oh the price you pay
Now you cant walk away from the price you pay
Little girl down on the strand
With that pretty little baby in your hands
Do you remember the story of the Promised land
How he crossed the desert sands
And could not enter the Chosen Land
On the banks of the river he stayed
To face the price you pay
So let the games start
You better run you little wild heart
You can run through all the nights and all the days
But just across the county line
A stranger passin through put up a sign
That counts so many fallen away
To the price you pay
Oh the price you pay oh the price you pay
Now you cant walk away from the price you pay
Oh the price you pay oh the price you pay
Now you cant walk away from the price you payDarlin youre tired
I can see in your eyes
I know how you feel
Weve been together
Too long to conceal
Whats in our hearts
Maybe we should part
But after so many years
That would only bring loneliness
Sorrow and tears
And anyway
I never would
Never could
Never will ever kill whats between us
So lets try again
Well start a brand new dance
Between old friends
There will always be days
When it dont seem to pay
When it just doesnt rhyme
Well thats bound to happen
Some of the time
Our best days arent gone
We dont need to move on
Well maybe we should try
But I dont think you could take it
And neither could I
And anyway
I never would
Never could
Never will ever kill whats between us
So lets try again
Well start a brand new dance
Between old friends
Darlin come here
Loves not disappeared
Youre just feelin low
Well let me tell you my darlin
Thats a feelin I know
It dont mean too much
We just got out of touch
Well its easy to change
Cause lovin yous not too hard to arrange
And anyway
I never would
Never could
Never will ever kill whats between us
So lets try again
Well start a brand new dance
Between old friends
Well start a brand new dance
Between old friends
Yes well start a brand new dance
Between old friendsSomeone found the letter you wrote me on the radio
And they told the world just how you felt
It mustve fallen out of a hole in your old brown overcoat
They never said your name but I knew just who they meant
Oh I was so surprised and shocked and I wondered too
If by chance you heard it for yourself
I never told a soul just how Id been feeling over you
But they said it really loud and said it on the air
On the radio
Oh on the radio
Oh on the radio
Oh
Now dont it kinda strike you sad when you hear our song
Things are not the same since we broke up last June
The only thing I want to hear is that you love me still
And that you think youll be coming home real soon
Oh he kinda a made me feel proud when I heard him say
You couldnt find the words to say it for yourself
And now in my heart I know I can say what I really mean
Cause they said it really loud they said it on the air
On the radio
Oh on the radio
Oh on the radio
Oh
Now if you think that love isnt found on the radio
Then tune right in you may find the love lost
Cause now Im sitting here with the man I sent away long ago
He found he really lied he said he really lied
On the radio
Oh on the radio
Oh on the radio
OhHe said Oh my love Oh my Antonia
You with the dark eyes and palest of skin
Tonight I am going from Santa Maria
Wait for me till Im in your arms once again
She held me she kissed me begged me not to leave her
To cross on onehe mountain my fortune to win
But a letter now tells me she died of a fever
Ill never see her in this world again
You are my sorrow you are my splendor
You are my shelter through storm and through strife
You are the one I will always remember
All off the days of my life
I curse the ambition that took me far from her
For a treasure not ever so fine or so fair
As the flash of her smile or the touch of her fingers
The fire in her heart and the smell of her hair
She left me a note that cried Do not weep for me
Behold you are with me as sure as the stars
That rise in the evening to shine down upon me
Behold I am with you wherever you are
I can still hear him he calls to me only
What once was begotten shall come to no end
But the road is so long and the nights are so lonely
My soul just to hold him in this world again
You are my sorrow you are my splendor
You are my shelter through storm and through strife
You are the one I will always remember
All of the days of my life
Oh my love Oh my Antonia
You with the dark eyes and palest of skin
How could I know that night in Santa Maria
Id never see you in this world againJean Ritchie
I hear the soft wind sighing
In every bush and tree
The sound of my heart crying
When you are far from me
When were apart my darlin
Theres sorrow in the wind
When were apart my darlin
Sweet sorrow in the wind
You leave me in the morning
Your footsteps die away
Tho not a leaf is stirring
I hear the wind all day
When were apart my darlin
Theres sorrow in the wind
When were apart my darlin
Sweet sorrow in the wind
They say when love grows older
It dies and fades away
Yet all our life together
One ever brightening day
When were apart my darlin
Theres sorrow in the wind
When were apart my darlin
Sweet sorrow in the wind
When were apart my darlin
Theres sorrow in the wind
When were apart my darlin
Sweet sorrow in the wind
Sweet sorrow in the windCome in as you tread lifes journey
Take Jesus as your daily guide
Though you may feel pure and safely
Without Him walking by your side
But when you come to make the crossing
At the ending of your pilgrims way
If you ever will meet our Savior
Youll surely meet Him on that day
Now look at that cold Jordan
Look at these deep waters
Look at that wide river
Oh hear the mighty billows roar
Youd better take Jesus with you
Hes a true companion
For Im sure without Him
That you never will make it oer
That awful Day of Judgment
Is coming in the by and by
Well see our Lord descending
In Glory from on high
So let us keep in touch with Jesus
And in his grace the Love of God
That we may be ever called ready
When He calls us over Jordans Tide
Now look at that cold Jordan
Look at these deep waters
Look at that wide river
Oh hear the mighty billows roar
Youd better take Jesus with you
Hes a true companion
For Im sure without Him
That you never will make it oerThe green rolling hills of West Virginia
Are the nearest thing to heaven that I know
Though the times are sad and drear
And I cannot linger here
Theyll keep me and never let me go
My daddy said dont ever be a miner
For a miners grave is all youll ever own
Cause the hard times are everywhere
I cant find a dime to spare
These are the worst times Ive ever known
So Ill move away into some crowded city
In some northern factory town youll find me there
Though Ill leave the past behind
Ill never change my mind
These troubled times are more than I could bear
But someday Ill go back to West Virginia
To the green rolling hills I love so well
Yes someday Ill go home
And I know Ill right the wrong
These troubled times will follow me no moreRoll along roll on rose of cimarron
Dusty days are gone rose of cimarron
Shadows touch the sand and
Look to see whos standing
Waiting at your window
Watching will they ever show
Can you hear them calling
You know they have fallen on
Campfires cold and dark now
Never see a spark burn bright
Trails that got them home
Kept the names theyve known
Four days high and lonely
Coming to you onlySteve RhymerElizabeth Rhymer
Hail hail to the newborn king
Let our voices sing him our praises
Hail hail to the guiding light
That brought us tonight to our savior
Ale alleluia alle alleluia
Ale alleluia alle alleluia
Come now there it shines so bright
To the knowing light of the stable
Lean close to the child so dear
Cast aside your fear and the thankfulSome say its destiny
Whether triumph or tragedy
But I believe we cast our nets out on the sea
And nothing we gather
Comes for free
I would have paid down through the years
A price beyond rubies beyond tears
To keep you safe with me
But your suspicion and your fear
Your vow to let nobody near was your trinity
Such a tragedy
I drew the best hand youd ever hold
Then cashed my winnings in long ago
Settled for silver how could I know
You were waiting with the gold
I could have caused your heart to yield
But I was only a disturbance in the field
Of your dreams
And I will never see you cry
You wont be with me when I die
A waste of you and me
A tragedy
We took the wrong train to
Kingdom come now
No more damage
Can be done baby
Its just what the world dont need
Its another stinkin tragedy
Thats how the story goes
Our chapters coming to a close
We are history
But I will always think of you
Every day until my days are through
You made me believe
In tragedyI see the light
I see the light at the end of the tunnel
I see the light and its burnin bright
I see the light its the light at the end that I run to
And the light darlin is you
In the lonely heart of darkness
I have stumbled and I have strayed
Always searchin but never finding
A ray of sunlight to guide my way
I see the light
I see the light at the end of the tunnel
I see the light and its burnin bright
I see the light its the light at the end that I run to
And the light darlin is you
I have travelled down this highway
Of hope abandoned and broken dreams
An unbeliever my faith was shaken
By all the sorrow I had seenIn that resurrection morning
When the trumpet of God shall sound
We shall rise we shall rise
Hallelujah
Then the saints will come rejoicing and
No tears will eer be found
We shall rise we shall rise
Hallelujah
We shall rise we shall rise
Hallelujah Amen
We shall rise in that resurrection morning
Hallelujah
When these prison bars are broken
We shall rise we shall rise
Hallelujah
In that resurrection morning
When the shades of life has fled
We shall rise we shall rise
Hallelujah
In the day of glory dawning when the sea
Gives up his dead
We shall rise we shall rise
Hallelujah
I shall see my blessed savior
Who so freely died for me
We shall rise we shall rise
Hallelujah
And our fathers and our mothers and our
Loved ones we shall see
We shall rise we shall rise
HallelujahI heard the train
In the Tulsa night
Calling out my name
Looking for a fight
Shes come a long long way
Got a longer way to go
So tell me how a train from Tulsa
Has got a right to know
She sings a song
So sad and high
And the Tulsa queen
Dont ever lie
And she dont care where she goes
Dont care where shes been
And the Tulsa queen aint crying
Cause I wont see you again
And I want to ride
Like a Tulsa queen
Calling out to you
As she calls to me
As far away from Tulsa
As these ten wheels can be
Lately I speak
Your name too loud
Each time it comes up
In a crowd
And I know it when I do
The Tulsa queen and you
Are goneYou may wonder if you know me
You may wonder if I care
Or if Ill leave you sad and lonely
Or if Ill always be right there
Well theres no need for doubt now darlin
Cause I have come to know
This love of ours is no common flower
You know this love is like a red red rose
And you may wonder about this dreamer
If shes all you thought shed be
And oh if anything but someday
Ever comes from lovin me
But hold me close and tell me darlin
That you have come to know
This love I bring you is no common thing
You know this love is like a red red rose
When youre all caught up in sweet surrender
Simple truth is sometimes hard to see
Here between the tough times and the tender
It all comes down to you and me
And you may see my heart of darkness
I may stumble now and again
But underneath this heart of darkness
Theres a heart thats lovin you right till the end
So hold me close come hold me darlin
Cause I want you to know
This love of ours is no common flower
You know this love is like a red red roseGods given us years of happiness here
Now we must part
And as the angels come and call for you
The pains of grief tug at my heart
Oh my darling
My darling
My heart breaks as you take your long journey
Oh the days will be empty
The nights so long without you my love
And when God calls for you Im left alone
But we will meet in heaven above
Oh my darling
My darling
My heart breaks as you take your long journey
Fond memories Ill keep of happy ways
That on earth we trod
And when I come we will walk hand in hand
As one in Heaven in the family of God
Oh my darling
My darling
My heart breaks as you take your long journeyElphaba why couldnt you have stayed calm for once Instead of flying off the handle
I hope youre happy
I hope youre happy now
I hope youre happy how youve
Hurt your cause forever
I hope you think youre clever
I hope youre happy
I hope youre happy too
I hope youre proud how you would
Grovel in submission
To feed your own ambition
So though I cant imagine how
I hope youre happy
Right now
Elphie listen to me Just say youre sorry
You can still be with the Wizard
What youve worked and waited for
You can have all you ever wanted
I know
But I dont want it
No
I cant want it anymore
Something has changed within me
Something is not the same
Im through with playing by
The rules of someone elses game
Too late for second-guessing
Too late to go back to sleep
Its time to trust my instincts
Close my eyes
And leap
Its time to try defying gravity
I think Ill try defying gravity
And you cant pull me down
Cant I make you understand
Youre having delusions of grandeur
Im through accepting limits
Cause someone says theyre so
Some things I cannot change
But till I try Ill never know
Too long Ive been afraid of
Losing love I guess Ive lost
Well if thats love
It comes at much too high a cost
Id sooner buy defying gravity
Kiss me goodbye Im defying gravity
And you cant pull me down
Glinda come with me Think of what we could do together
Unlimited
Together were unlimited
Together well be the greatest team
Theres ever been Glinda
Dreams the way we planned em
If we work in tandem
Theres no fight we cannot win
Just you and I defying gravity
With you and I defying gravity
Theyll never bring us down
Well are you coming
I hope youre happy
I hope your happy now that your choosing this
You too
I hope it brings you bliss
I really hope you get it
And you dont live to regret it
I hope youre happy in the end
I hope youre happy my friend
So if you care to find me
Look to the Western sky
As someone told me lately
Everyone deserves the chance to fly
And if Im flying solo
At least Im flying free
To those who ground me
Take a message back from me
Tell them how I am defying gravity
Im flying high defying gravity
And soon Ill match them in renown
And nobody in all of Oz
No wizard that there is or was
Is ever gonna bring me down
I hope youre happy
Look at her
Shes wicked
Get her
Bring me down
No one mourns the wicked
So we got to bring her
Ah
DownWell I used to roll and I used to ramble
Out on the wilder side of town
Every night I hear the bright lights calling
I never thought I could ever settle down
Well I seen a whole lot of pain and trouble
In this lonesome life of mine
But you gave me love and you gave it double
And Ill always be your sweetheart of the pines
Ill always be your little sweetheart of the pines
Now you searched the dark side of the mountain
Just to find what you thought true love should be
But you found a heart that could love you better
When you got around to the other side of me
Well I seen a whole lot of pain and trouble
In this lonesome love of mine
But you gave me love and you gave it double
And Ill always be your sweetheart of the pines
Ill always be your little sweetheart of the pines
Now you make me feel lovesick darlin
The way I did back when my heart was young
But Im young enough to start all over
And old enough to show you how its done
Well I seen a whole lot of pain and trouble
In this lonesome life of mine
But you gave me love and you gave it double
And Ill always be your sweetheart of the pines
Ill always be your little sweetheart of the pinesIn a lonely room waiting for the night to fall
I hear your voice in every whip-poor-will that calls
And it takes me back to a better place and a sweeter time
When I was yours and you were mine
As the shadows fall and the light grows dim I see your face
I close my eyes and feel the warmth of your embrace
As I long for you and for all those days when hearts entwined
When I was yours and you were mine
When I was yours and you were mine
When I was yours and you were mine a truer love in Caroline
Ever waltzed across these hills and danced beneath the stars
Life was sweeter than the flowers blooming on the vine
When I was yours and you were mine
So I lay my head on a pillow soft and stained with tears
I cry for you through all the long and lonely years
But when I dream till the morning sun comes to shine
Then Ill be yours and youll be mineShe stands on the banks of the mighty Mississippi
Alone in the pale moonlight
Waitin for a man a riverboat gambler
Said that hed return tonight
They used to waltz on the banks of the mighty Mississippi
Lovin the whole night through
He was a riverboat gambler off to make a killin
And bring it on back to you
Evangeline Evangeline
Curses the soul of the Mississippi queen
That pulled her man away
Bayou Sam from south Louisiana
Had gamblin in his veins
Evangeline from the maritime
Was slowly goin insane
High on the top of a hickory hill
She stands in the lightning and thunder
Down on the river the boat was a sinkin
She watched that queen go under
Evangeline Evangeline
Curses the soul of the Mississippi queen
That pulled her man away
Evangeline Evangeline
Curses the soul of the Mississippi queen
That pulled her man awayShes a devil in disguise you can see it in her eyes
Shes tellin dirty lies shes a devil in disguise in disguise
Now a woman like that all she does is hate you
She doesnt know what makes a man a man
Shell talk about the time that shes been with you
Shell speak your name to everyone she can
Shes a devil in disguise you can see it in her eyes
Shes tellin dirty lies shes a devil in disguise in disguise
Unhappiness has been her close companion
Her world is full of jealousy and doubt
It gets her off to see a person crying
Shes just the kind that you can do without
Shes a devil in disguise you can see it in her eyes
Shes tellin dirty lies shes a devil in disguise in disguise
Her number always turns up in your pocket
Whenever you are looking for a dime
Its alright to call her but Ill bet you
The moon is full and youre just wasting time
Shes a devil in disguise you can see it in her eyes
Shes tellin dirty lies shes a devil in disguise in disguise
In disguise in disguise
In disguise in disguiseGram ParsonsChris Ethridge
Yes you loved me and you sold my clothes
I love you but thats the way that it goes
So it goes
Yes you know how I feel
So it goes
It just couldnt be real
And we know its wrong
And I dont think its gonna go on
When I come home carrying my shoes
Ive been waiting to tell you some news
And you want me home all night
And you dont want another fight
But you better love
Find some love
You better love me Jesus Christ
Yes you loved me and you sold all my clothes
I love you baby but thats the way that it goes
So it goes
I guess you know how I feel
So it goes
Yes it couldnt be realChris HillmanBill Wilds
They tell me Im the talk of the town
Ive been staying home alone every night
Its nobodys business where Im bound
As if to be alone and lonely just aint right
On a old freight train moving down the line
Im counting each day and every minute that your away
Ive never been the stay at home kind
But for you its just the price that I pay
Its just the price I pay for loving you
The price I pay for needing you so much
The price I pay for needing you
And putting all this time between us
I knew I was in trouble when we met
Dark clouds all around me I couldnt find the light
The hard time aint hard to forget
I believe in love at first sight
I put my heart and soul on the line
And know your love is with me every day
Your picture always there on my mind
But for you its just the price that I pay
Its just the price I pay for loving you
The price I pay for needing you so much
The price I pay for needing you
And putting all this time between usMy baby needs a shepherd
She s lost out on the hill
Too late I tried to call her
When the night was cold and still
And I tell myself I ll find her
But I know I never will
My baby needs a shepherd
She s lost out on the hill
My baby needs an angel
She never learned to fly
She ll not reach sanctuary
Just by looking to the sky
I guess I could have carried her
But I didnt even try
My baby needs an angel
She never learned to fly
Oh I ran so far through a broken land
I was following that drummer
Beating in a different band
And somewhere on the highway
I let go of her hand
Now she s gone forever
Like her footprints in the sand
Toora loora loora lo
First the seed and then the rose
Toora loora loora li
My kingdom for a lullaby
My baby needs a pilot
She has no magic wand
To help her part the troubled waters
Of the Rubicon
But in my soul I know she ll
Have to go this one alone
After all that is only way she s ever known
But there is no lamp in all this dark
That could chase away her shadow
From the corners of my heart
I pray she s ride a dolphin
But she s swimming with the shark
Out where none can save her
Not even Noah and his ark
Toora loora loora lo
To the cradle comes the crow
Toora loora loora li
My kingdom for a lullaby
My baby needs a mother
To love her till the end
Up every rugged mountain
And down every road that bends
Sometimes I hear her cryin
But I guess it s just the wind
My baby needs a mother
To love her till the endYoure free to go darling
Ill break the ties that bind
Somehow the plans we made have gone astray
Youre free to go darling
So ease your worried mind
Ill never stand in your way
Theres no ream of shining gold
So strong that it can hold
A heart that longs to be near
The lips are cold darling
That once said yes to me
The tender love is gone I know
Youre free to go
Theres no ream of shining gold
So strong that it can hold
A heart that longs to be free
The lips are cold darling
That once said yes to me
The tender love is gone I know
Youre free to go
The tender love is gone I know
Youre free to goEverytime you leave
You tear the soul from me
I die a little more each time part
I cant control my dreams
My heart cant seem to learn
To turn and lock its door when you return
I know that youll come back again
As soon as you get blue
And I know what will happen then
One kiss and Ill give one to you
Everytime you leave
You tear the soul from me
But I want to live so Ill forgive
Everytime you leaveAnd his love will be his vision
And hell take you where you stand
And will you stand your life by his
And help the boy become a man
Will he be the son of his father
His father the teacher
Teachin love and honesty
An bein his own manhandler
Or the son of
The son of a run of the mill
Run rotten gambler
Will the devil be getting to you
As you look back over what youve done
And what youve done was it for reason or for rhyme
Was it just for fun
Will he be the son of his father
His father the teacher
Teachin love and honesty
An bein his own manhandler
Or the son of
The son of a run of the mill
Run rotten gambler
Back on the road now you can lose your head
There aint no kingdom for the gamblin man
You know the road now and youve made your stand
When his eyes shine upon you shine upon you
Will he be the son of his father
His father the teacher
Teachin love and honesty
An bein his own manhandler
Or the son of
The son of a run of the mill
Run rotten gambler
Will he be the son of his father

Well theres a place down Kentucky
Said right down near Ohio
You can watch the planes at night
People line up to watch each flight
I said a-watchin them planes
Well I wish I was on one
Sittin here thinkin bout my crazy dream
If I could only see him tonight
Oh Atlanta Oh Atlanta
Whoah whoah Atlanta
Got to get back to you
You can drop me off on Peachtree
I got to feel that Georgia sun
And the people in Atlanta
They make you awful glad you come
I said a-watchin them planes
Well I wish I was on one
Sittin here thinkin bout my crazy dream
If I could only see him tonight
Oh Atlanta Oh Atlanta
Whoah whoah Atlanta
Got to get back to you
Well go down just you and me
Where the music plays all night
Theyve got the boogie band playin thats bound for hell
When they get to movin they never stop
They just keep on playin that down home beat
Keep on layin down harmony
Yeah I wish I was on one
Sittin here thinkin bout my crazy dream
If I could only see him tonightI wandered so aimless life filled with sin
I wouldnt let my dear savior in
Then Jesus came like a stranger in the night
Praise the Lord I saw the light
Just like a blind man I wandered a long
Worries and fears I claimed for my own
Then like the blind man that God gave back my sight
Praise the Lord I saw the light
I was a fool to wander and stray
Straight is the gate and narrow the way
Now I have traded the wrong for the right
Praise the Lord I saw the light
I saw the light I saw the light
No more in darkness no more in night
Now Im so happy no sorrow in sight
Praise the Lord I saw the lightRoses are red
Violets are blue
Primrose is pale
On the velvet green hue
Warm summer days
Like cool water falls
Like music we hear
Those things well always hold dear
Like an old fashioned waltz
When the moonlight shines down
On the Hollywood world
And the heroine waits
For her love to return
And the violins play
From behind garden walls
Oh how I love to remain
With the silver refrain
Of an old fashioned waltz
And they dance round the floor
And theres no one else there
In the world is no worry
And is never a care
And the perfect moon
As the nightingale calls
With only the moon
And the nostalgic tune
Of an old fashioned waltzOh oh deep water black and cold like the night
I stand with arms wide open
Ive run a twisted line
Im a stranger in the eyes of the Maker
I could not see for the fog in my eyes
I could not feel for the fear in my life
From across the great divide In the distance I saw a light
Of Jean Baptistes hes walking to me with the Maker
My body my body is bent and broken by long and dangerous sleep
I cant work the fields of Abraham and turn my head away
Im not a stranger in the hands of the Maker
Brother John have you seen the homeless daughters
Standing there with broken wings
I have seen the flaming swords
There over east of Eden
Burning in the eyes of the Maker
Burning in the eyes of the Maker
Burning in the eyes of the Maker
Oh river rise from your sleep
Oh river rise from your sleep
Oh river rise from your sleepMy latest sun is sinking fast
My race is nearly run
My strongest trials now are past
My triumph has begun
Oh come angel band
Come and around me stand
Oh bear me away on your snow white wings
To my immortal home
Oh bear me away on your snow white wings
To my immortal home
Oh bear my longing heart to him
Who bled and died for me
Whose blood now cleanses from all sin
And gives me victory
Oh come angel band
Come and around me stand
Oh bear me away on your snow white wings
To my immortal home
Oh bear me away on your snow white wings
To my immortal homeKeep that candle burnin bright mama
Ill be kind of late tonight mama
Theres a yellow moon above me mama

Chorus
Burn that candle night and day
Burn that candle honey light our way
Keep that doorway open wide

Chorus x twoBruce Springsteen
I got a sixty-nine Chevy with a three hundred and ninety-six
Fuelie heads and a Hurst on the floor
Shes waiting tonight down in the parking lot
Outside the Seven-Eleven store
Me and my partner Sonny built her straight out of scratch
And he rides with me from town to town
We only run for the money got no strings attached
We shut em up and then we shut em down
Tonight tonight the strips just right
Im gonna blow em off in my first heat
Summers here and the time is right
For racin in the street
We take all the action we can meet
And we cover all the northeast states
When the strip shuts down we run em in the street
From the fire roads to the interstate
Now Some guys they just give up living
And start dying little by little piece by piece
Some guys come home from work and wash up
And go racin in the street
Tonight tonight the strips just right
Im gonna blow em all out of their seats
Calling out around the world
Were going racin in the street
He met her on the strip three years ago
In a Camaro with this dude from LA
He blew that Camaro off his back and he drove that little girl away
But now theres wrinkles around his babys eyes
And she cries herself to sleep at night
When he comes home the house is dark
She says Baby did you make it alright
She sits on the porch of her daddys house
But all her pretty dreams are torn
She stares out alone into the night
With the eyes of one who hates for just being born
For all the shut-down strangers and hot rod angelsFolks in Nashville slammed the door
Said we dont want you anymore
Find your own way down the road
Pack your fiddle and your guitar
Take a train or take a car
Find someone else to keep you from the cold
Rollin and ramblin
Women loved him half to death
He sang with whiskey on his breath
His heart broke like a childs
Rollin and ramblin
The sun has set out on the trail
The hobos drifted up the rail
Hes taken his last ride
Oh he always sang the blues
Like it was all he ever knew
He didnt sing at all that night
He was pale and as he dozed
He didnt know his time had closed
Slumped in the back seat to the right
Rollin and ramblin
Women loved him half to death
He sang with whiskey on his breath
His heart broke like a childs
Rollin and ramblin
The sun has set out on the trail
The hobos drifted up the rail
Hes taken his last ride
So they send him on night train south
Through the cities and the rural routes
Just one more place to go
Ah the whistle sang the bluest note
Like it came from his own throat
Moanin sad and cryin low
Rollin and ramblin
Women loved him half to death
He sang with whiskey on his breath
His heart broke like a childs
Rollin and ramblin
The sun has set out on the trail
The hobos drifted up the rail
Hes taken his last ride
Rollin and ramblin
The sun has set out on the trail
The hobos drifted up the rail
Hes taken his last ride oh oh ohShe
She came from the land of the cotton
A land that was nearly forgotten
By everyone
And she
She worked and she slaved so hard
A big ol field was her backyard
In the delta sun
Oh but she sure could sing
Yes yes
She sure could sing
Then he
Looked down and he took a little pity
The whole town swore he decided
He help her some
And he
Didnt mind if she wasnt very pretty
For deep inside his heart he knew
She was the only one
Oh but she sure could sing
My my she sure could sing
She had faith and she had believin
She led all the people together in singin
And she prayed very night
To the Lord up above
Singin hallelujah
Oh hallelujah
They
Would walk singin songs by the river
Even when she knew for sure
She had to go away
And she
Never knew what her life had to give her
And never had to worry about it
For one single day
Oh but she sure could sing
Yes yes she sure could singTraditional
Out on the perilous deep
where danger silently creeps
and storms so violently sweeping
Youre drifting too far from shore
Youre drifting too far from shore
Come to Jesus today
Let Him show you the way
Youre drifting too far from shore
Today the Tempest rose high
and clouds oershadow the sky
Sure death is hovering nigh
Youre drifting too far from shore
Drifting too far from shore
Youre drifting too far from shore
Come to Jesus today
Let Him show you the way
Youre drifting too far from shore
Why meet a terrible fate
Mercies abundantly wait
Turn back before its too late
Youre drifting too far from shore
Drifting too far from shore
Youre drifting too far from shore peaceful shore
Come to Jesus today Let him show you the way
Youre drifting too far from shoreCowboys and Indians and trees he could climb
Tomorrow came too fast but he didnt mind
The distance was short so light it again
It dont take no time to get where I am
But one paper kid wasnt really so mean
Just a little bit scarred and a little bit green
And hed heard of a place it was legal to dream
So he sat with his coffee in a blue Texas wind
And he wrote on a rock
The one paper kid is rollin again
Driver was drunk or he just didnt see
The future is there itll happen to me
And all the time that he wasted was his once again
Ah it never takes long to get where youve been
Broken hearts scattered all over the past
Old bad memories trying to last
Whiskey and women and growing up fast
Fussing and loving and itching like grass
Hell that one paper kid wasnt really so mean
Just a little bit weird cause times were so lean
Now hes gone to a place where its legal to dream
No camels no coffee no cold morning winds
It was wrote on a rock
The one paper kid is rollin againYou are learning what its like to sit and cry
And wonder why your plans went wrong
You are learning how it feels when pain is real
To realize youre all alone
Yes youre learning
We had the chance to be happy
Nothing stood in our way
If only youd meant what you promised
We wouldnt crying today
You are learning that a lie can make you cry
For the truth your heart reveals
You are learning that a flirt can cause a hurt
Even though your love is real
Yes youre learning
We had the chance to be happy
Nothing stood in our way
If only youd meant what you promised
We wouldnt crying todayI often sing for those I love
Who go to live with Christ above
No more on earth their forms Ill see
When I am gone wholl sing for me
Wholl sing for me when I am gone
And it wont be long til when Ill see
When I am gone wholl sing for me
Til I too must say goodbye
Just over there with Christ Ill be
Get all my friends to sing for me
Wholl sing for me when I am gone
As I so oft for friends have done
And it wont be long til when Ill see
When I am gone wholl sing for meWhat do you get when you fall in love
A girl with a pin to burst your bubble
Thats what you get for all your trouble
Ill never fall in love again
Ill never fall in love again
What do you get when you kiss a girl
You get enough germs to catch pneumonia
After you do shell never phone ya
Ill never fall in love again
Ill never fall in love again
Dont tell me what its all about
Cause Ive been there and Im glad Im not
Out of those chains those chains that bind you
That is why Im here to remind you
What do you get when you fall in love
You only get lies and pain and sorrow
So far at least until tomorrow
Ill never fall in love again
Ill never fall in love againThe worst that Ive ever been hurt
In my life
The first time I ever have
Wanted to die
Was the night when you told me
You loved someone new
And you asked me if I could forget
When I stop dreaming
Thats when Ill stop loving you
You may teach the flowers
To bloom in the snow
You may take a pebble
And teach it to growRodney Crowell
Soul mate
I see you down there
Waiting for morning
To softly be coming
I find
Im only in deeper
And youd be a leaver
If you werent so scared
Your true love
Has made you feel better
But look out for later
When she makes you feel worse
Times change
In daydreams and flashes
A taste of the past is
All I have seen
But youre supposed to be feeling good now
Cause everybody said you would
Honey does it blow your mind
That the prophets would lie
Youre supposed to be in your prime now
Not supposed to be wasting your time
Feeling like youre down and out
Over someone like meI met my darlin in the springtime
When all the flowers were in bloom
And like the flowers our love blossomed
We married in the month of June
Our love was like a burning ember
It warmed us as a golden glow
We had sunshine in December
And threw our roses in the snow
Now God has taken my darlin
And left me with a memory
A memory I will always cherish
Are these last words he said to me
Our love was like a burning ember
It warmed us as a golden glow
We had sunshine in December
And threw our roses in the snow
My darlins buried on the hillside
Where all the wild spring flowers grow
And when winter snows start fallin
On his grave Ill place a rose
Our love was like a burning ember
It warmed us as cold winds blow
We had sunshine in December
And threw our roses in the snowDarlin I have come to tell you
Tho it almost breaks my heart
But before the mornin darlin
Well be many miles apart
Dont this road look rough and rocky
Dont that sea look wide and deep
Dont my baby look the sweetest
When hes in my arms asleep
Cant you hear the nightbirds cryin
Far across the deep blue sea
While others you are thinking
Wont you sometimes think of me
Dont this road look rough and rocky
Dont that sea look wide and deep
Dont my baby look the sweetest
When hes in my arms asleep
One more kiss before I leave you
One more kiss before we part
You have caused me lots of trouble
Darlin you have broke my heart
Dont this road look rough and rocky
Dont that sea look wide and deep
Dont my baby look the sweetest
When hes in my arms asleepRodney Crowell
When you look at me
Like you dont know me
And you talk to me
Like youve never met me
I can leave you alone if I try
If I tried I could tell you goodbye
If I wanted to
I could be long gone
And I dont have to crawl
Then you call on me
As if I should run to you
You make your move
As if I should follow you
Well I dont have to be nobodys fool
I wont make no exception of you
I dont have to be nobodys fool
I dont make no exception of you
I dont have to crawl
I can just walk away
No I dont have to crawl
I dont have to get down on my knees
I dont have to crawl
I can just walk away
No I dont have to crawlLeo RobinJule Styne
A kiss on the hand may be quite continental
But diamonds are a girls best friend
A kiss may be grand but it wont pay the rental
On your humble flat or help you at the automat
Men grow cold as girls grow old
We all lose our charm in the end
But square cut or pear shape
These rocks dont lose their shape
Diamonds are a girls best friend
Yeah diamonds are a girls best friend
Lets rock
There may come a time when a lass needs a lawyer
Diamonds are a girls best friend
There may come a time when a hardboiled employer
Thinks youre awful nice but get that ice or else no dice
Hes your guy when stocks are high
But beware when they start to descend
Its then that those spouses
And diamonds are a girls best friend
Diamonds are a girls best friend
Yeah diamonds are a girls best friend
Lets rock again
Diamonds are a girls best friend
Diamonds are a girls best friend
Diamonds are a girls best friend
Diamonds are a girls best friendBuck Owens

Nobody can deny that theres something there
There	running my hands thru his hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be someone is speaking
But he doesnt know shes there
I want him everywhere and if hes beside me I know I need never care
But to love him is to meet him
Everywhere knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies watching his eyes and hoping im
Always there
To be here and everywhere here there and everywhere
I want him everywhere and if hes beside me I know I need never care

Know not what the years may hold
As I ponder hope grows fonder
Precious memories flood my soul
Precious father loving mother
Glide across the lonely years
And old homes scenes of my childhood
In fond memories appears
Precious memories how they linger
How they ever flood my soul
In the stillness of the midnight
Precious sacred scenes unfoldPaul Siebel
Those other years the dusty years
We drove the big hers through
I tried to forget the miles we rode
And Spanish Johnny too
Hed sit beside a water ditch when all this herd was in
And hed never harm a child but sing to his mandolin
The old talk the old ways and the dealin of our game
But Spanish Johnny never spoke but sing a song of Spain
And his talk with men was vicious talk
When he was drunk on gin
Ah but those were golden things he said to his mandolin
We had to stand we tried to judge we had to stop him then
For the hand so gentle to a child had killed so many men
He died a hard death long ago before the road come in
And the night before he swung he sung to his mandolinIm looking for that Lonely Street
Ive got a sad sad tale to tell
I need a place to go and weep
Wheres this place called Lonely Street
A place where theres just loneliness
Where dim lights bring forgetfulness
Where broken dreams and memories meet
Wheres this place called Lonely Street
Perhaps upon that Lonely Street
Theres someone such as I
Who came to bury broken dreams
And watch an old love die
A place where theres just loneliness
Where dim lights bring forgetfulness
Where broken dreams and memories meet
Wheres this place called Lonely StreetEverybodys had a few
Now theyre talking about who knows who
Im going back to the crescent city
Where everythings still the same
This town has said what it has to say
Now Im after that back highway
And the longest bridge Ive ever crossed over Pontchartrain
Tu les ton sans temps thats what we say
We used to dance the night away
Me and my sister me and my brother
We used to walk down by the river
Mama lives in mandeville
I can hardly wait until
I can hear my zydeco
And laissez le bon ton roulet
And take rides in open cars
My brother knows where the best bars are
Lets see how these bluesll do
In the town where the good times stay
Tu les ton sans temps thats what we say
We used to dance the night away
Me and my sister me and my brother
We used to walk down by the riverI meant to ask you how to fix that car
I always meant to ask you about the war
And what you saw across a bridge too far
Did it leave a scar
Or how you navigated wings of fire and steel
Up where heaven had no more secrets to conceal
And still you found the ground beneath your wheels
How did it feel
Bang the drum slowly play the pipe lowly
To dust be returning from dust we begin
Bang the drum slowly Ill speak of things holy
Above and below me world without end
I meant to ask you how when everything seemed lost
And your fate was in a game of dice they tossed
There was still that line that you would never cross
At any cost
I meant to ask you how you lived what you believed
With nothing but your heart up your sleeve
And if you ever really were deceived
By the likes of me
Bang the drum slowly play the pipe lowly
To dust be returning from dust we begin
Bang the drum slowly Ill speak of things holy
Above and below me world without end
Gone now is the day and gone the sun
There is peace tonight all over Arlington
But the songs of my life will still be sung
By the light of the moon you hung
I meant to ask you how to plow that field
I meant to bring you water from the well
And be the one beside you when you fell
Could you tell
Bang the drum slowly play the pipe lowly
To dust be returning from dust we begin
Bang the drum slowly Ill speak of things holy
Above and below me world without endOh Ill pawn you my gold watch and chain love
And Ill pawn you my gold wedding ring
I will pawn you this heart in my bosom
Only say that youll love me again
Darling how could I stay here without you
I have nothing to ease my poor heart
This old world would seem sad love without you
Tell me now that we never will part
Oh Ill pawn you my gold watch and chain love
And Ill pawn you my gold wedding ring
I will pawn you this heart in my bosom
Only say that youll love me again
Take back all the gifts you have given
A diamond ring and a lock of your hair
And a card with your picture upon it
Its a face that is false but is fair
Oh Ill pawn you my gold watch and chain love
And Ill pawn you my gold wedding ring
I will pawn you this heart in my bosom
Only say that youll love me again
Oh the white rose that blooms in the garden
It grows with the love of my heart
It broke through on the day that I met you
It will die on the day that we part
Oh Ill pawn you my gold watch and chain love
And Ill pawn you my gold wedding ring
I will pawn you this heart in my bosom
Only say that youll love me again
Only say that youll love me againJames Taylor
Now my grandfather was a sailor
He blew in off the water
My father was a farmer
I his only daughter
Took up with a no-good millworking man from Massachusetts
Who dies from too much whiskey
And leaves me these three faces to feed
Millwork aint easy mill-work aint hard
Millwork it aint nothing but an awful boring job
Im waiting for a day dream
To take me through the morning
And put me in my coffee break
Where I can have a sandwich and remember
Then its me and my machine
For the rest of the morning
For the rest of the afternoon
And the rest of my life
Now my mind begins to wander
To the days back on the farm
I can see my father smiling at me
Swingin on his arm
I can hear my grand-dads stories
Of the storms out on Lake Erie
Where vessels and cargos and fortunes
And sailors lives were lost
Yes but its my life has been wasted
And I have been the fool
To let this manufacture use my body for a tool
I can ride home in the evening
Staring at my hands
Swearing by my sorrow that a young girl
Ought to stand a better chance
So may I work the mills
Just as long as I am able
And never meet the man whose
Name is on the label
It be me and my machine
For the rest of the morning
For the rest of the afternoon
And the rest of my lifeWhen darkness fills the valley
Fear and dread strive deep within us
But our burdens soon will be lifted
When these old homes turn to dust
When he calls
Im going to live with Jesus
In his kingdom he welcomes everyone
I shall not fear no more earthly peril
For he will carry me home
Now Satan will come to tempt me
But Ill try to resist sinful ways
And i pray that Ill find salvation
In that peaceful home far away
When he calls
Im going to live with Jesus
In his kingdom he welcomes everyone
I shall not fear no more earthly perils
For he will carry homeYou give your hand to me and then you say hello and I can hardly speak
My heart is beating so
And anyone could tell you think you know me well
But you dont know me
No you dont know the one who dreams of you at night
And longs to kiss your lips and longs to hold you tight
Im just a friend thats all Ive ever been
But you dont know me
For I never knew the art of making love
Though my heart aches with love for you
Afraid and shy I let my chance go by
The chance that you might love me too
For I never knew the art of making love
Though my heart aches with love for you
Afraid and shy I let my chance go by
The chance that you might love me tooGuess its time for me to say just how it is that I feel today
Today is just like any other day cause youve been on my mind
It really hasnt been that long but its funny where the time has flown
Old memories just keep holding on and you been on my mind
You been on my mind sometimes
I think I must be going blind
Ive seen a world baby without you
But I dont see myself there too
Hardly does a day go by when I dont see your clear blue eyes
Many night I just wonder why and you been on my mind
Youve been on my mind so long
Ive been thinking that something was wrong
Ive told myself I should forget
But I dont seem to have it yet
I dont dream that you might change I dont think that Im acting strange
I tell myself its all in vain and you been on my mind
Youve been on my mind Ive said
Till its all thats in my head
Yes I know what I must do
But I dont think youll be there too
Guess its time for me to go but as it is Ill never know
Just what it is that I long for so And you been on my mind
You been on my mindLiving below in this old sinful world
Hardly a comfort can afford
Striving alone to face temptations call
Where could I go to the Lord
Where could I go where could I go
Seeking a refuge for my soul
Needing a friend to help me in the end
Where could I go to the Lord
Neighbors are fun I love Ãem everyone
We get along in sweet accord
But when I pass the chilling hand of death
Where could I go to the Lord
Where could I go where could I go
Seeking a refuge for my soul
Needing a friend to help me in the end
Where could I go to the Lord
Life here is grand with friends I love so well
Comfort I get from Gods own Word
But when my soul needs manna from above
Where could I go to the Lord
Where could I go where could I go
Seeking a refuge for my soul
Needing a friend to help me in the end
Where could I go to the Lord
Where could I go where could I go
Seeking a refuge for my soul
Needing a friend to help me in the end
Where could I go to the Lord
Where could I go to the LordRichard Holler
I am a backseat driver from America
They drive to the left on Falls Road
And the man at the wheels name is Shamus
We pass a the child on a corner he knows
And Shamus says now what chance has that kid got
And I say from the back I dont know
He says theres barbed wire at all of these exits
There aint no place in Belfast for that kid to go
And its a hard life its a hard life
Its a very hard life
Its a hard life wherever you go
And we poison our children with hatred
And the hard life is all that they know
At the dairyline in Chicago
A fat man in front of me
Hes calling black people trash to his children
And hes the only trash here I see
And Im thinking this man wears a white hood
In the night when his children should sleep
But theyll slip to their windows and see him
Theyll think that white hoods all they need
And its a hard life its a hard life
Its a very hard life
Its a hard life wherever you go
And if we poison our children with hatred
Then the hard life is all that they know
I was a child of the sixties
When dreams could be held through tears
With Disney and Cronkite and Martin Luther
And I belived I believed I believed
Now Im a backseat driver from America
And Im not at the wheel of control
And I am guilty I am worn I am the root of all evil
And I cant drive on the left side of the road
And its a hard life its a hard life
Its a very hard life
Its a hard life wherever you go
And if we poison our children with hatred
Then the hard life is all that theyll know
And there aint no place in this world for these kids to go
Cause its a hard life wherever you go
Has anybody here seen my old friend Abraham
Can you tell me where hes gone
He freed a lotta people but it seems the good die young
I just looked around and hes gone
Has anybody here seen my old friend Martin
Can you tell me where hes gone
He freed a lotta people but it seems the good die young
I just looked around and hes gone
Has anybody here seen my old friend John
Can you tell me where hes gone
He freed a lotta people but it seems the good die young
I just looked around and hes gone
Didnt you love the things they stood for
Didnt they try to find some good in you and me
And well be free
Someday soon its gonna be one day
Has anybody here seen my old friend Bobby
Can you tell me where hes gone
I thought I saw him walkin up over the hill
With Abraham and Martin and JohnTheres a valley of sorrow in my soul
Where every night I hear the thunder roll
Like the sound of a distant gun
Over all the damage I have done
And the shadows filling up this land
Are the ones I built with my own hand
There is no comfort from the cold
Of this valley of sorrow in my soul
Theres a river of darkness in my blood
And through every vein I feel the flood
I can find no bridge for me to cross
No way to bring back what is lost
Into the night it soon will sweep
Down where all my grievances I keep
But it wont wash away the years
Or one single hard and bitter tear
And the rock of ages I have known
Is a weariness down in the bone
I use to ride it like a rolling stone
Now just carry it alone
Theres a highway risin from my dreams
Deep in the heart I know it gleams
For I have seen it stretching wide
Clear across to the other side
Beyond the river and the flood
And the valley where for so long Ive stood
With the rock of ages in my bones
Someday I know it will lead me homeLonely tears roll down
As midnight comes around
But i can make it trough
In sweet dreams of you
In the shadow of the night
I still hold you tight
Did it all comes true
In sweet dreams of you
In sweet dreams i see
The way thing you to be
When your love was thide
And your heart was true
In sweet dreams of you
Oh i call out your made
And you come to me again
The way you used to do
In sweet dreams of you
In sweet dreams of you
In sweet dreams of youI know your leaving is too long overdue
For far too long Ive had nothing new to show to you
through dry eyes I watched your plane
Fade off west of the moon
And it felt so strange to walk away alone
No regrets no tears goodbye
Dont want you back wed only cry again
Say goodbye a-gain
The hours that were yours echo like empty rooms
The thoughts we used to share I now keep alone
I woke last night and spoke your name
Not thinking you were gone
And it felt so strange to lie awake alone
No regrets no tears goodbye
Dont want you back wed only cry again
Say goodbye a-gain
Our friends have tried to turn my nights to day
Strange faces in your place cant keep the ghosts away
Just behind the darkest hour just before dawn
It still feels so strange to lead my life alone
No regrets no tears goodbye
Dont want you back wed only cry again
Say goodbye a-gainIt was a teenage wedding
And the old folks wished them well
You could see that Pierre
Did truly love the mademoiselle
And now the young monsieur and madame
Have rung the chapel bell
Cest la vie say the old folks
It goes to slow you never can tell
They furnished off an apartment
With a two room Roebuck sale
The coolerator was crammed
With TV Dinners and ginger ale
But when Pierre found work
The little money comin worked out well
Cest la vie say the old folks
It goes to show you never can tell
They had a hi-fi phono
Boy did they let it blast
Seven hundred little records
All rockin rhythm and jazz
But when the sun went down
The rapid tempo of the music fell
Cest la vie say the old folks
It goes to show you never can tell
They bought a souped-up Jimmy
Twas a cherry-red fifty three
Drove it down to Orleans
To celebrate their anniversary
It was there that Pierre
Was wedded to the lovely mademoiselle
Cest la vie say the old folks
It goes to show you never can tellEverybodys talkin at me
I dont hear a word their sayin
Only the echos of my mind
People stop and stare
I cant see their faces
Only the shadows of their eyes
Im goin where the sun keeps shinin
Through the pourin rain
Goin where the weather suits my clothes
Bankin off of the northeast winds
Sailin on summer breeze
And skippin over the ocean like a stone
Im goin where the sun keeps shinin
Through the pourin rain
Goin where the weather suits my clothes
Bankin off of the northeast winds
Sailin on summer breeze
And skippin over the ocean like a stone
Everybodys talkin at me
Cant hear a word their sayin
Only the echos of my mind
I wont let you leave my love behind
No i wont let you leave
I wont let you leave my love behindLast night I dreamed about you
I dreamed that you were older
You were looking like Picasso
With a scar across your shoulder
You were kneeling by the river
You were digging up the bodies
Buried long ago
Michelangelo
Last night I dreamed about you
I dreamed you were a pilgrim
On a highway out alone to find
The mother of your children
Who were still unborn and waiting
In the wings of some desire
Abandoned long ago
Michelangelo
Were you there at Armageddon
Was Paris really burning
Could I have been the one to pull you
From the point of no returning
And did I hear you calling out my name
Or was it forgotten long ago
Michelangelo
Last night I dreamed about you
I dreamed that you were riding
On a blood red painted pony
Up where the heavens were dividing
And the angels turned to ashes
You came tumbling with them to earth
So Far below
Michelangelo
Last night I dreamed about you
I dreamed that you were dying
In a field of thorn and roses
With a hawk about you crying
For the warrior slain in battle
From an arrow driven deep inside you
Long ago
Michelangelo
Did you suffer at the end
Would there be no one to remember
Did you banish all the old ghosts
With the terms of surrender
And could you hear me calling out your name
Well I guess that I will never know
Michelangelo
Last night I dreamed about you
I dreamed that you were weeping
And your tears poured down like diamonds
For a love beyond all keeping
And you caught them one by one
In a million silk bandannas that I gave you long ago
MichelangeloIf today the sun should set on all my hopes and cares
There is one whose smiling face the Gods would see
Cause hell walk along beside me up those golden stairs
Oh theyll never ever take his love from me
Well I thought Id make him happy if I stepped aside
But I knew his love would never set me free
And even on the day he took another to be his bride
I said theyll never ever take his love from me
Im so thankful for each golden hour of happiness
That we shared together in what used to be
Someone elses arms may hold him now in fond caress
But theyll never ever take his love from me
What a fool I was to go and break the trust he gave
And to see his love turn into sympathy
Its the one regret Ill carry with me to my grave
Oh theyll never ever take his love from me
Oh theyll never ever take his love from meHe was born in the Bitterroot Valley in the early morning rain
Wild geese over the water heading north and home again
Bringing a warm wind from the south
Bringing the first taste of the spring
His mother took him to her breast and softly she did sing
Oh Montana give this child a home
Give him the love of a good family and a woman of his own
Give him a fire in his heart give him a light in his eyes
Give him the wild wind for a brother and the wild Montana skies
His mother died that summer and he never learned to cry
He never knew his father and he never did ask why
He never knew the answers that would make an easy way
But he learned to know the wilderness and to be a man that way
His mothers brother took him in to family and his home
Gave him a hand that he could lean on and a strength to call his own
And he learned to be a farmer and he learned to love the land
And he learned to read the seasons and he learned to make a stand
Oh Montana give this child a home
Give him the love of a good family and a woman of his own
Give him a fire in his heart give him a light in his eyes
Give him the wild wind for a brother and the wild Montana skies
On the eve of his twenty-onest birthday he set out on his own
He was thirty years and running when he found his way back home
Riding a storm across the mountains and an aching in his heart
Said he came to turn the pages and to make a brand new start
Now he never told a story of the time that he was gone
Some say he was a lawyer some say he was a John
There was something in the city that he said he couldnt breathe
And there was something in the country that he said he couldnt leave
Oh Montana give this child a home
Give him the love of a good family and a woman of his own
Give him a fire in his heart give him a light in his eyes
Give him the wild wind for a brother and the wild Montana skies
Now some say he was crazy and theyre glad that he is gone
But some of us miss him and well try to carry on
Giving a voice to the forest giving a voice to the dawn
Giving a voice to the wilderness and the land that he lived on
Oh Montana give this child a home
Give him the love of a good family and a woman of his own
Give him a fire in his heart give him a light in his eyes
Give him the wild wind for a brother and the wild Montana skies
Oh Montana give this child a home
Give him the love of a good family and a woman of his own
Give him a fire in his heart give him a light in his eyes
Give him the wild wind for a brother and the wild Montana skiesIf theyll play another love song
And if that Miller Highlife light stays dim
And if youll keep my glass full of whiskey
Ill whisper words I wish Id said to him
Just ask me to dance all the slow ones
Hold me close and take me cross the floor
Ill gently lay my head on your shoulder
And pretend this never happened before
I dont want to hear a sad story
We both already know how it goes
So if youll be my tall dark stranger
Ill be your San Antone Rose
I wish I could tell you I love you
I wish that he werent always on my mind
I wishes were fast trains to Texas
Id ride and Id ride how Id rideTraditional
Bright morning stars are rising
Bright morning stars are rising
Bright morning stars are rising
Day is a-breaking in my soul
Oh where are our dear mothers
Day is a-breaking in my soul
They are down in the valley praying
Day is a-breaking in my soul
Oh where are our dear fathers
Day is a-breaking in my soul
They have gone to heaven shouting
Day is a-breaking in my soul
Bright morning stars are rising
Day is a-breaking in my soulLets take a ride to the seaside
We can go out swimming in the high tide
Just wear your shorts and your long hair
Dont forget the lawn chair
Everybodys gone to the movies
Everybodys gone and its groovy
They went to the one about the big war
I didnt Id seen it before
I guess Im taking my chances
Giving up the ring throwing in my gloves
I guess Im taking my chances
Trading in my things
For a couple wings a little white dove
And one big love one big love one big love one big love
Everybody do like a monkey
If you want to go on and be funky
No need to talk like a hero
Talk a walk count down to zero
No sense defending your honor
Just go on and kiss him if you want to
Everything before is gone or going somewhere
I guess Im taking my chances
Giving up the ring throwing in my gloves
I guess Im taking my chances
Trading in my things for a couple wings on a
Little white dove
And one big love one big love one big love one big love
I dont know where we are
And I dont care
And now were out of gas
And riding on air
And one big love one big love one big love one big love
Lets take a ride to the seaside
We can go out swimming in the high tide
Everybodys gone to the movies
Everybodys gone and its groovy
Everybody do like a monkey
If you want to go on and be funky
No need to talk like a hero
Talk a walk count down to zero
No sense defending your honor
Just go on and kiss him if you want toWe know its wrong to let this fire burn between us
Weve got to stop this wild desire in you and in me
So well let the flame burn once again until the thrill is gone
Then well sweep out the ashes in the morning
Were two people caught up in the flame that has to die out soon
I didnt mean to start this fire and neither did you
So tonight when you hold me tight well let the fire burn on
And well sweep out the ashes in the morning
Each time when we meet we both agree that its for the last time
But out of your arms Im out of my mind
So well taste the thrill of stolen love tonight until the dawning
And well sweep out the ashes in the morning
Were two people caught up in the flame that has to die out soon
I didnt mean to start this fire and neither did you
So tonight when you hold me tight well let the fire burn on
And well sweep out the ashes in the morningTheres a picture that I carry
One we made sometime ago
When they ask whos in the picture with me
I say just someone I use to know
Just someone I use to spend some time with
Just a flame that lost its glow
And I dont tell them how lost I am without you
I say just someone I use to know
Just someone I use to run around with
Just a friend from long ago
I dont tell them all the nights I cry without you
I say just someone I use to know
I say just someone I use to knowLove its not I who didnt try
Hard enough hard enough
And this is why Im saying goodbye
Ive had enough Ive had enough
Love you dont see
The pain in me
Thats plain enough plain enough
Youre never here to catch the tears
I cried for us I cried for us
Ill take my share but Ill be fair
Theres not much stuff
Easy enough
And if you choose Ill break the news
This part is tough so very tough
Ive tried and tried to put aside
The time to talk but without luck
So Ill just pin this note within your coat
And leave the garden gate unlockedWhen I go dont cry for me
In my fathers arms Ill be
The wounds this world left on my soul
Will all be healed and Ill be whole
Sun and moon will be replaced
With the light of Jesus face
And I will not be ashamed
For my savior knows my name
It dont matter where you bury me
Ill be home and Ill be free
It dont matter where I lay
All my tears be washed away
Gold and silver blind the eye
Temporary riches lie
Come and eat from heavens store
Come and drink and thirst no more
So weep not for me my friend
When my time below does end
For my life belongs to him
Who will raise the dead again
It dont matter where you bury me
Ill be home and Ill be free
It dont matter where I lay
All my tears be washed awayYou give your hand to me and then you say hello and I can hardly speak
My heart is beating so
And anyone could tell you think you know me well
But you dont know me
No you dont know the one who dreams of you at night
And longs to kiss your lips and longs to hold you tight
Im just a friend thats all Ive ever been
But you dont know me
For I never knew the art of making love
Though my heart aches with love for you
Afraid and shy I let my chance go by
The chance that you might love me too
For I never knew the art of making love
Though my heart aches with love for you
Afraid and shy I let my chance go by
The chance that you might love me tooMister Sandman bring me a dream

When the only way to slow down is to fall
And its only rock and roll that caused you to leave home
When the only way to get back is to crawl
But the record people love you they can get you on the bill
Change your name to money dress up fit to kill
People all around you everywhere you go
Dont worry if they love you son its only rock and roll
Yes and its only rock and roll keep you jumping all the time
When you really ought to sit this one out
And its only rock and roll keep on messin with your mind when
You dont know what theyre talkin about
All around the world everywhere you go
People got to have it cause its only rock and roll
Its only rock and roll yes its only rock and roll
People all around you everywhere you go
Dont worry if they love you cause its only rock and roll
Well its only rock and roll when your moneys in the mail
And your loves on the back of the bus
And its only rock and roll when your records start to sell
And you dont know why theyre making such a fuss

The mention of your name
And all my love for you burst into flames
I tried so hard
To let you got but look
How I still tremble at your name
Thats all it took
Thats all it took
To make me know that I still care
It seems my heart just cant give up
The dreams we used to share
I tell my friends Im happy
But they read me like a book
And when today I heard them say your name
Thats all it took
Thats all it took
To make me yearn for your embrace
I guess I might as well admit
No one can take your place
I fell for you completely
Sinker line and hook
And when today I heard them say your name
Thats all it took
And when today I heard them say your name
Thats all it tookSomething in your eyes makes me want to lose myself
Makes me want to lose myself in your arms
Theres something in your voice makes my heart beat fast
Hope this feeling lasts the rest of my life
If you knew how lonely my life has been
And how long Ive felt so low
If you knew how I wanted someone to come along
And change my life the way youve done
Feels like home to me
Feels like home to me
Feels like Im all the way back where I come from
Feels like home to me
Feels like home to me
Feels like Im all the way back where I belong
A window breaks down a long dark street
And a siren wails in the night
But Im alright cause I have you here with me
And I can almost see through the dark theres light
If you knew how much this moment means to me
And how long Ive waited for your touch
If you know how happy you are making me
Ive never thought Id love anyone so much
Feels like home to me
Feels like home to me
Feels like Im all the way back where I come from
Feels like home to me
Feels like home to me
Feels like Im all the way back where I belong
Feels like Im all the way back where I belongI was born a black boy
My name is Emmett Till
I walked this earth for fourteen years
Then one night I was killed
For speaking to a woman
Whose skin was as white as dough
Thats a sin in Mississippi
But how was I to know
Id come down from Chicago
To visit with my kin
Up there I was a cheeky kid
I guess I always been
But the harm they put upon me
Was too hard for what I done
For I was just a black boy
I never hurt no one
They took me from my uncles house
Mose Wright was his name
Hed later stand and without hesitation
Point the blame
At the ones who beat and cut me
And shot me with a gun
Then threw me in the river
Like I was trash when they were done
I was sent back to my mother
At least what was left of me
She kept my casket open
For the whole wide world to see
The awful desecration
And the evidence of hate
You could not recognize me
The mutilation was so great
There came a cry for justice then
To be finally fulfilled
All because of me a black boy
My name is Emmett Till
But Id have rather lived
Til I was too old to die young
Not miss all I left behind
All that might have come
The summer clouds above my head
The grass beneath my feet
The warmth of a good woman
Her kisses soft and sweet
Perhaps to be a father
With a black boy of my own
And watch him grow into
A kinder world than I had known
Where no child would be murdered
For the color of his skin
And love would be the only thing
Inside the hearts of men
They say the horror of that night
Is still haunting heaven still
Where I am one more black boy
My name is Emmett TillIm a bit run down but Im okay
Just feel like callin it a day
But you send me back to the start
You drive a hard bargain
Each time Im headin for nowhere
Doomed and determined to go there
It seems I never get far
You drive a hard bargain
You drive a hard bargain
Hows a girl supposed to fail
With someone like you around them
Ive tried and tried to no avail
You just cant seem to let me down
You drive a hard bargain
You drive a hard bargain
Hows a girl supposed to fail
With someone like you around them
Ive tried and tried to no avail
You just cant seem to let me down
You drive a hard bargain
You drive a hard bargain
So Ill keep on playin that old song
Cause for all I know its where I belong
When the world is breaking my heart
You drive a hard bargain
You send me back to the start
You drive a hard bargain
You drive a hard bargain
Im a bit run down but Im okayIt seems to me lately
The days are growing shorter
The years are going faster
And time is flying by
I wake up in the morning
And before I even notice
The sun is going down
And Im left to wonder why
Im a lonely girl in a lonely world
I never thought my life would be like this
To have no one to hold my hand
And feel once more a sweet caress
Id give it my best effort
Love is always worth it
But even if I try
I might still end up alone
It may not be in me
To take what love could give me
Some of us are better off
To make it on our own
As a lonely girl in a lonely world
And though my life has been so blessed
I have no one to hold my hand
And feel once more a sweet caress
Ive had my share of lovers
And cared for many others
I always thought thered be
Another one to come along
But if love cant find me again
Ill put it all behind me then
Ill just go and learn to sing
Another sad love song
About a lonely girl in a lonely world
She never dreamed her life would be like this
To have no one to hold her hand
And feel once more a sweet caressSo its finally come
You have left this world
But well miss our Kate
Our darling girl
We held your hand
Kissed your lovely brow
And bid farewell
Youre sailing now
Free from the pain
You laid that burden down
But youre strong and giving heart
Will surely be your crown
As you slip the surly bonds of earth
And sail away
Perhaps we will meet again
Somehow some day
Until then theres nothing we can do but wait
To see once more
Our darling Kate
All those nights we sang
And talked til the sun come up
You fed our souls
You filled our cup
With your perfect words
And oh that voice
We fell in love
We had no choice
And I cant say
For sure where you have gone
But in that place
Im bettin theres a better song
For weve all known down here
The taste of joy and strife
You were the sweetest note
In the chord of life
Now youve slipped the surly bonds of earth
And sailed away
Perhaps we will meet again
Somehow some day
But if there was one name I could consecrate
It would be yours
It would be KateA big black dog
A little too much gray around the muzzle
A big black dog
Why she ended up at the pound is a puzzle
A big black dog
Did she run away
Because somebody didnt treat her right
Did they leave her out in the cold
Night after lonely night
A big black dog
A big black dog
I found her one day down there at the metro
A big black dog
Waitin in a cage in line for the death row
Big black dog
Did somebody her put here out on the road
And did just not care
Did they think an old dog was too much trouble
For them to bear
A big black dog
Her name is Bella Bella
Youre not brown youre not yella
Bella Bella
My big black dog
Big black dogs theyre everywhere
Lookin for a home theyre hungry and scared
All they need is food and attention
Theyll give you back love
Sometimes redemption I swear
You could find it there
In a big black dog
A big black dog
She may be a little rough around the edges
A big black dog
When you throw a ball shell always go and fetch it
This big black dog
With a brand new leash and a brand new collar
Its a brand new game
I love to see the way she runs to me when I holler
Out her name
My big black dog
Her name is Bella Bella
Youre not brown youre not yella
Bella Bella
My big black dog
My big black dogMy Lord how the rains came down
The waters made a mighty sound
When the levees broke that day
Washin all those souls away
The whole world stood to watch us drown
But we took it to a higher ground
It takes more than a hurricane
To empty out the Pontchartrain
Long ago we broke the chains
In New Oreleans New Orleans
When Brother Bill and Sister Nell
Are singing like a ringing bell
Then youll know all is well
In New Orleans New Orleans
Bring it all fire and flood
Fill the rivers up with mud
To cut and run aint in our blood
We are New Orleans
So baby let the life roll on
The blues were made to make us strong
Were walkin in a brighter day
Nothin can get in our way
The whole world stood to watch us drown
But we took it to a higher groundWorkin hard all my life
Always tried to get it right
Every day and every night
Hey hey hey carry me home
Singin in a honky tonk
People dancin getting drunk
Never knowin what I want
Hey hey hey carry me home
I just want a little
Give me just a little
Just a little piece of mind
Cant somebody tell me
Please somebody tell me
How long does this road unwind
Sis white Cadillacs
Crossin on the railroad track
Angels in the front and back
Hey hey hey carry me homeI can still remember
Every song you played
Long ago when we were younger
And wed rock the night away
How could I see your future then
Where you would not grow old
With such a fire in our bellies
Such a hunger in our souls
I guess I probably loved you
When those words rolled off your tongue
It seemed that we were travelin
Under some ol lucky sun
I know I couldnt save you
And no one was to blame
But the road we shared together once
Will never be the same
Hey hey gonna fly away
Wont be coming round today
Hey hey with a song I pray
And on the wings of a song Ill fly away
I wandered in the wilderness
For a while I was so lost
To everything there is a season
And every blessing has its cost
So I took what you left me
And put it to some use
Went looking for an answer
With those three cords and the truth
I come down from the mountain
I come walkin in your shoes
I was taken for a gambler
When I had no more to lose
Cause you put me on that pathway
How could I refuse
And I spend my whole life out here
Workin on the blues
So I carried on
You cant be haunted by the past
People come and people go
And nothing ever lasts
But I still think about you
Wonder where you are
Can you see me from some place
Up there among the stars
But down here under heaven
There never was a chart
To guide our way across
This crooked highway of the heart
And if its only all about
The journey in the end
On that road Im glad I came to know
My old friend
Hey
Gone away
Wont be coming round again
Hey
With a song I pray
And on the wings of a song
Ill fly away
Ill fly away
Ill fly awayWhere are you now
She writes Where are you now my love
Do you have food to eat
Shoes for your tired feet
Am I the one youre dreaming of
Do you know how I miss you
How I long to kiss you
Pray for the day you will come
Back to me my darling one
He thinks about her
All through the long watches of night
The bullets are flying
Young men are dying
He prays for the first crack of light
And when he can finally sleep
Into his dream shell sweep
On the sweet web she has spun
And for a while they are one
When she kisses the ship on his arm
All of his sorrows unravel
He knows he will come to no harm
Over all of the miles he has travel
Her love is an anchor
Her love is forever
Its true now her love is the charm
When she kisses the ship on his arm
Blessed are they these fearless young lovers
Their lives have just barely begun
Blessed is the day they return to each other
After all of the battles are done
And finally they are oneSometimes I feel like
Im drownin in teardrops
My eyes are so tired of
The trouble Ive seen
Then you fell from the heavens
Right into this sad place
Remembering God for awhile in your dreams
And you look to me now
So I greet the new day
With the eyes of a child
And the wonder you bring
So goodnight old world
Well see you tomorrow
We rise with the sun
And fall with the sparrow
But here is this child
To soften the sorrow
Goodnight old world
Old world goodnight
You fell from the heavens
Right into this sad place
Remembering God for a while in your dreams
And you look to me now
And I greet the new day
With the eyes of a child
At the wonder you bring
So goodnight old world
See you tomorrow
We rise with the sun
Fall with the sparrow
But here is this child
To soften the sorrow
Goodnight old world
Old world goodnight
Goodnight old world
Old world goodnightI live out here in the wind and the pouring rain
Somewhere between fourteenth Avenue and Main
In the summer heat the winters freezing snow
You see I got nowhere else to go
Got no home sweet home
Into this world some are bound to roam
And its long hard road weve known
On the way to home sweet home
People pass by they dont see me here
And if they do they wish I would disappear
I guess they know way down deep in their bones
It could be them out there lookin for a home
For a home
Oh to have a place to lay my head
A crumb or two for my daily bread
Perhaps someday
A kind soul will come along
Help me to find my way back
Where I belong
Back to a homeFollowed your road till the sky ran out
Followed your love till love was in doubt
Followed your love till it never really was at all
Feeling stupid and hollow
Now the moons gonna follow me home
Waited for you till the snow fell down
Over my skin like a thin nightgown
Waited for you but you never came around at all
Waited for you till they pulled the plug
Bartender emptied out his big tip jug
They swept all the floors
Vacuumed the rugs and went home
Drank all I could swallow
Now the moons gonna follow me home
Repeat twoX
Time go easy on me tonight
Cause Im one of the lost sheep alright
Take what you must take what you must
Of what Ive lost as I have roamed
And let the moon follow me home
Followed your tears with a washing pail
I followed your story I followed your tail
Followed you straight through the
Doors of your jail cell tooChorus
Ill never swim Kern River again
It was there that I met him
There that I lost my best friend
Now I live in the mountains
I drifted up here with the wind
And I may drown in still water
But Ill never swim Kern River again
He grew up in an oil town
But that gusher never came in
And the river was a boundary
Where my darling and I used to swim
One night in the moonlight
The swiftness swept his life away
Now I live on Lake Shasta
And Lake Shasta is where I will stay
Theres the South San Joaquin
Where the seeds of the dust bowl are found
And theres a place called Mt Whitney
From where the mighty Kern River comes down
Now its not deep nor wide
But its a mean piece of water my friend
And I may cross on the highway
But Ill never swim Kern River again
Chorus Chorus
How she could sing the Wildwood Flower
The orphan girl he would love so long
In the end he knew shed been his finest hour
And all he has left of her is a song
He first saw her
Standing by a cabin door
Her song was ringing
Out in a voice so strong and sure
To the lonesome valley
He bring her there to be his bride
Where they would live and work together
Side by side
She was his sunshine
She was his moon and morning star
His words would ring to
The chords of her guitar
He was driven
And lost to her for days and days
Til the lonesome valley
Finally drove her far away
Chorus
We all cling to
As the years keep rolling on
One single promise
Of a love thats past and gone
And that lonesome valley
We all walk it by ourselves
With the wildwood flower
Is a story we will tell
Chorus
How she could sing the Wildwood Flower
And all we have left of her is a songLost On The River Dark Is The Night
Just Like The Blind Praying For Site
Drifting Alone Heart Filled With Fright
Im lost On The River The River Of Life
Once Dear I Thought I Knew The Way
That Was Before Old Sad Yesterday
Words That You Said Cut Like A Knife
Im Lost On The River The River Of Life
Out On This River Where Sorrows Free
Thinking Of You How My Heart Pleads
Tomorrow Youll Be Another Mans Wife
Im Lost On The River The River Of LifeWhat happened to your mothers love
What happened to your daddys pride
Although you always said enough
Though they were right by your side
What happened to that ball of fire
It got out on that empty road
Nothing but our own desires
Lighten up this heavy load
Hold on hold on hold on
I know you didnt plan for this
But thats the way it always starts
Hes looking for a little kiss
Instead you bought a broken heart
Now you had to build a bridge
Only you can walk across
Wear the tooth until it fits
Pay the price and bear the loss
Hold on hold on hold on
Once you were a little kid
Working on a great big plan
They threw away the simple joys
And now you have to take a stand
Battles rage in your head
You wish you didnt have to fight
Just hold on to my hand instead
Another day goes by tonight
What happened to your mothers love
What happened to your daddys pride
Way down deep in your inside your blood
Help you through this lonely ride
Hold on hold on hold on
Hold on hold on hold on
Hold on hold on hold on
Hold onI was once a broken man
I was once a broken fool
Lost my wife and children
To one basic broken rule
Now I live my life in silence
Tho Im not quite in a shell
Drink and listen to that song
A whiter shade of pale
A whiter shade of pale
I was good shad tree mechanic
So I send myself to school
They smoothed off my rough edges
In my hands they put new tools
The instructor once he told me
I could work on any line
I could tend and make any diesel sing
Just like Patsy Cline
Just like Patsy Cline
Well I met my wife to be
Through my mothers best friends son
She had been a bar room singer
She was as good as anyone
But I ask her to stop singing
And the girl she did not flinch
Next day she went and bought that man
A brand new crescent wrench ohh
A brand new crescent wrench
We had three fine children
As eight years went on by
And earned a silver visor
The knuckles stayed bone dry
But after supper I kept hearin her
By the kitchen radio
Singing sweet but desperate harmony
A little bit to low ohhh
A little bit to low
She left three months later
Id just come home for lunch
Note said easy come hard go
I still love you so much
She said I dont know if Ill be there
Or if youll want me when I come
But if and when that Abbott steer
You better
Let my sweet dream run ohhh
Let my sweet dream run
Ohhhhohhhohhhohhh
I was good shad tree mechanic
So I send myself to school
They smoothed off my rough edges
In my hands they put new tools
The instructor once he told me
I could work on any line
But now the diesels arent the only thing that sing
Just like Patsy Cline
Just like Patsy Cline
I was once a broken man
I was once a broken fool
Lost my wife and children
To one basic broken rule
Now I live my life in silence
Tho Im not quite in a shell
Drink and listen to that song
A whiter shade of pale
A whiter shade of pale
A whiter shade of pale
A whiter shade of paleDont you believe I love you long enough
Didnt I try to give you all the right stuff
Hung around when the going got tough
Dont you believe I love you long enough
Where were you when the world turned black
All those nights you never answered back
And I just ask you to cut me a little slack
Where were you when the world turned black
Chorus
One of these days Im gonna take that ride
Tho there maybe nothing on the other side
Im too old for changin
My true blues have all been tried
One of these days Im gonna take that ride
You always were the one
Gave me my place out in the sun
And we raised a glass to the one
It was thy will be done
So dont you believe its time to let me go
The clock is winding down and Im moving slow
I could keep on dancing just for show
Dont you believe its time to let me go
One of these days Im gonna take that ride
Whatevers waiting on the other side
Had a little glory and I still got my pride
One of these days Im gonna take that ride
One of these days Im gonna take that ride
Oh dont you believe its time to take that ride
Take that ride
Take that ride
Take that rideWhen Joseph was an old man an old man was he
He married Virgin Mary the Queen of Galilee
He married Virgin Mary the Queen of Galilee
Mary and Joseph walk through an orchid green
There were berries and cherries as thick as might be seen
There were berries and cherries as thick as might be seen
And Mary said to Joseph so meek and so mild
Joseph gather me some cherries for I am with child
Joseph gather me some cherries for I am with child
And Joe flew in anger in anger flew he
Let the father of the baby gather cherries for thee
Let the father of the baby gather cherries for thee
Then up spoke Baby Jesus from in Marys womb
Bend down the tallest tree that my mother might have some
Bend down the tallest tree that my mother might have some
And bent down tallest branch till it touched Marys hand
Cried she Oh look thou Joseph I have cherries by command
Cried she Oh look thou Joseph I have cherries by commandYou once dreamed of castles and merry go rounds
To be Cinderella in an Alice movie
Now side streets and back beats and what might have been
Lead you to nowhere again and again
The curtain is calling come take your bow
Its getting too late for turning back now
Can you still believe that lifes a cabaret
And fairy tales will carry you away
Its closing time and youre left on your own
And only you can find a way back home
You look under rainbows look over the lies
You look for an answer in anyones eyes
Reach out for lovers in too many beds
Reach for the needle but cant hold a thread
Whiskey and roses fill your loving cup
Leaving you empty when the suns coming up
And you still believe that lifes a cabaret
And fairy tales will carry you away
When loneliness is the world youve ever known
And only you can find the way back home
That knight in shining armor you know hell never come
On to the cabaret old chum
Do you still believe that lifes a cabaret
That fairy tales will carry you away
Its closing time and youre left on your own
And only you can find a way back home
The way back home
The way back home
The way back homeI spent a lifetime making up my mind to be
More than the measure of what I thought others could see
Good luck and fast bucks are too far and too few between
Cadillac buyers and old five and dimers like me
Yes she stood beside me letting me know she would be
Something to lean on when everything ran out on me
Fenced yards aint hole cards and like is not never will be
Reason for rhymers and old five and dimers like me
Its taken me so long but now that I know I believe
All that I do or say all that I ever will be
Too far and too high and too deep aint too much to be
Too much aint enough for old five and dimers like me
Too far and too high and too deep aint too much to be
Too much aint enough for old five and dimers like me
And an old five and dimer is all I intended to beMan you should have seen me way back then
I could tell a tale I could make a spin
I could tell you black was white I could tell you day was night
Not only that I could tell you why
Back then I could really tel a lie
Well Id hire a kid to say he was lame
Then Id touch him and make him walk again
Then Id pull some magic trick Id pretend to heal the sick
I was takin everything they had to give
It wasnt all that bad a way to live
Well Im in this desert town and its hot as hell
But no ones byuin what I got to sell
I make my lame kid walk I make a dumb guy talk
Im preachin up a storm both night and day
But everyone just turns and walks away
Well I can see that Im only wasting time
So I head across the road to drink some wine
This old man comes up to me He says I seen you on the street
Youre pretty good if I do say myself
But the guy that come through here last month he was sometin else
Instead of allin out for fire from above
He just gets real quiet and talks about love
And Ill tell you sometin funny He didnt want nobodys money
Now Im not exactly sure what this all means
But its the damndest thing I swear Ive ever seen
Well since that time every town is the same
I cant make a dime I dont know why I came
I decide Ill go and find him And find out whos behind him
He has everyone convinced that hes for real
Well I figure we can work us out a deal
So he offers me a job and I say fine
He says Ill get paid off on down the line
Well I guess Ill string along Dont see how too much can go wrong
As long as he pays my way I guess Ill follow
Were headed for Jerusalem tomorrowOld brown clock ticking on my shelf
Take my mind to someplace else
Little gold clock ticking by my bed
Funny little people dancing round my head
Morning brings me things to do
Morning brings me thoughts of you
Gentle sunshine through the curtain lace
Some of which shining on your sweet face
Counting hours making days
Watching time throwing love away
Nothing golden never stays
Thats what I heard the poets say Mmm
Time is always taking me
Places I dont want to be
But when the morning rise the moon
I know a bird days coming soon
Counting hours making days
Watching time throwing love away
Nothing golden never stays
Thats what I heard the poets say Mmm
Morning brings me things to do
Morning brings me thoughts of you
Gentle sunshine through the curtain lace
Some of which shining on your sweet faceCall happy calling children are falling
In line to ride on the merry-go-round
People are passing children are laughing
They want to ride on the merry-go-round
Doesnt matter when you came
Every ride is just the same
Do not worry how its done
There is room for everyone
Carousel turning children are yearning
To ride it forever and never come down
Little ones singing older ones clinging
Everyone riding the merry-go-round
Go round and round and up and down
Round and round they go always reaching for the ring of gold
Never knowing when the musics over they will be old
Call happy calling children are falling
In line to ride on the merry-go-round
People are passing children are laughing
They want to ride on the merry-go-round
Sometimes up and sometimes down
Dont let your feet ever touch the ground
Sometimes right and sometimes wrong
Youll end up where you belong
Sound of their laughter makes the ride faster
Soon the circus stand must come down
Music grows nowhere the ride is over
Say goodbye to the merry-go-roundIts over our love affair
Too late now I find I care
His sweet love no more Ill share
Now hes gone Im alone
I was wrong should have known
Took me home on our last date
I search for a single way
To tell him what I had to say
I kissed him watched him walk away
Set him free foolishly destiny misery
Tragedy on our last date
Took the ring from my trembling fingers
Brushed a tear from my babys eye
Walked away didnt know
That Id soon miss him so
Guess I was too young to realize
So blind I couldnt see
How much he really meant to me
And that soon he would always be
On my mind in my heart I was blind from the start
Lost his love on our last dateBroken bottles broken songs
Broken people been in town too long
Wheres everyone gone
Oh baby this city gonna break your heart
Oh gypsy please tell me
Where everyones gone
Never had a second name
Never spoke of why we came
Fellowship and Gloriousness
The loneliness of pain
Sitting in the rain
Why is the soul of me
Where is my heart
Where is the part of me
That I would give to you
If kindness were my style
Where is the soul of me
Where is my heart
In my own time
Better leave it behind
In a thousand bottles of wine
Oh precious plans of standing strong
Why is life taking so long
I would tell you everything
If I only had the words to explain
Dont know nothing but the rain
Why is the soul of me
Where is my heart
Where is the part of me
That I would give to you
If kindness were my style
Where is the tenderness
Where is the warmth
In my own soul
That I let it grow old
Oh its getting so cold
Broken bottles broken songs
Broken faces been in town too long
Where has everyone gone
Oh baby this city gonna break your heart
Oh gypsy please tell me
Where everyones gone
Oh gypsy please tell me
Where everyones gone
Where everyones gone
Where everyones goneChorus
How she could sing the Wildwood Flower
The orphan girl he would love so long
In the end he knew shed been his finest hour
And all he has left of her is a song
He first saw her
Standing by a cabin door
Her song was ringing
Out in a voice so strong and sure
To the lonesome valley
He bring her there to be his bride
Where they would live and work together
Side by side
She was his sunshine
She was his moon and morning star
His words would ring to
The chords of her guitar
He was driven
And lost to her for days and days
Til the lonesome valley
Finally drove her far away
Chorus
We all cling to
As the years keep rolling on
One single promise
Of a love thats past and gone
And that lonesome valley
We all walk it by ourselves
With the wildwood flower
Is a story we will tell
Chorus
How she could sing the Wildwood Flower
And all we have left of her is a songTherell be greener pastures
Across that border line
Well see new horizons my darlin
Far beyond the great divide
Pools of clear blue waters
Starlight in the sky
Youll be mine forever my darlin
Far beyond the great divide
Somewhere in the distance
Northern lights will shine
Youll be there beside me my darlin
Far beyond the great divideMan is an island sadly adrift
Wandring forever while continents shift
He came out of nowhere no shirt on his back
Armed for survival no plan of attack
He went to the mountain he went to the sea
He cried for protection but begged to be free
He fell on that mountain he drowned in the sea --
Blind to the order death to the harmony
Natures his rival natures his friend
In the beginning there was no end
God is his island -- He made the sun
Nature mankind as one
Man is an island sadly adrift
Wandring forever while continents shift
God is his island -- He made the sun
Nature mankind as one
God is his island -- He made the light
Man on his island waits for the end of night
In the beginning there was no endBeneath her clothes her heart is breaking
Spends her mornings making lines
Though her pain is real and aching
All she owns are borrowed lines
Doesnt know which side to be on
Though shes trying every door
Only needs the floor she sleeps on
All she asks is a little more time
Bobbies gone to California
I wont see her anymore
Bobbies gone to California
Like she did the year before
And the year before
The day she left her shirt was clinging
To her back wet with rain
I watched her leave heard her singing
A song she wrote when Christmas came
Bobbies young but getting older
The face she shows is not her own
Winters near its getting colder
Californias called her home again
Bobbies gone to California
I wont see her anymore
Bobbies gone to California
Like she did the year before
And the year before
The mirror gives back no reflection
Of shadow she will not see
It understands she needs protection
Of what she swears she has to be
Bobbies nights are empty tables
Hold her til shes made to leave
Bobbies dreams are empty fables
She makes herself believe
To be free
Sometimes she cried because of visions
Of what she loved had all been sold
Theres not much left no one to listen
To the echoes that she holds
How could I tell her when shes fading
She run out of a place to be
There will be no one waiting
For the poetry of her soul
I wont see her anymore
Bobbies gone to California
Like she did the year before
And the year beforeHe was a tall man
Raised up from the fields out pickin cotton
In a hard land where the ground was poor and the wood was rotten
But when he saw her
All those bad times were forgotten
And he believed he believed
She was the strong hand
A good sister and a daughter
Lookin for one man
To love the way that her mamad taught her
And when she saw him
She thanked God for what hed brought her she believed she believed
And its a miracle
How one soul finds another
Just one miracle
Is all it took my brother
For I have seen them
As they walk this world together
And I believe I believe
Its a sad thing
When one must leave the other
And fly up where the voice rings
Out with all the multitudes that gather
But for a short while
Down here no song ever sounded sweeter
And we believed we believed
For its a miracle
How one soul finds another
Just one miracle
Is all it took my brother
And I will see them
Someday theyll walk again together
I believe I believe
This I believe I believeOne last gaze upon the sun
Bid farewell to everyone
Kick that bucket out the door
Where Im going I wont need it anymore
Going lay my burden down
Take a birds eye look around
From the tall pines of Carolina
All the way to wall of China
Chorus
So Ill go sailing round the room
Through my window cross to silver moon
No flesh and bone to hold me
Ill finally set my soul free
When I go sailing round the room
Life maybe be just but a dream
Float my boat on down the stream
To wake up on a different shore
aint something Ive ever been before
I could be a drop of summer rain
Falling down on an Oklahoma plain
Oh leave the world behind me
Look around and you will find me
Chorus
I will be in the smoke from Monaloha
Morning mist on the Shenadoah
I will be a grain of sand in the Kalahara
Magnolia by the Mississippi
I will be birdsong when day is breaking
Words of love when your heart is aching
I will be blue bonnet by the highway
Ill be everywhere and always
Chorus
Through my window cross to silver moon
No flesh and bone to hold me
Ill finally set my soul free
When I go sailing round the roomOh my mama told me
Cause she say she learned the hard way
Say she wanna spare the children
She say dont give or sell your soul away
Cause all that you have is your soul
Chorus
Dont be tempted by the shiny apple
Dont you eat of the bitter fruit
Hunger only for a taste of justice
Hunger only for a world of truth
Cause all that you have is your soul
I was a pretty young girl once
I had dreams I had high hopes
I married a man he stole my heart away
He gave his love but what a high price I paid
And all that you have is your soul
Why was I such a young fool
Thought Id make history
Making babies was the best I could do
Thought Id made something that could be mine forever
Found out the hard way one cant possess another
And all that you have is your soul
Chorus
I thought thought that I could find a way
To beat the system
To make a deal and have no debts to pay
Id take it all take it all Id run away
Me for myself first class and first rate
But all that you have is your soul
Here I am waiting for a better day
A second chance
A little luck to come my way
A hope to dream a hope that I can sleep again
And wake in the world with a clear conscience and clean hands
Cause all that you have is your soul
Chorus
Oh my mama told me
Cause she said she learned the hard way
She said she want to spare the children
She said it dont give to sell your soul away
All that you have is your soul
All that you have
All that you have
All that you have
All that you have is your soulMy baby needs a shepherd
She s lost out on the hill
Too late I tried to call her
When the night was cold and still
And I tell myself I ll find her
But I know I never will
My baby needs a shepherd
She s lost out on the hill
My baby needs an angel
She never learned to fly
She ll not reach sanctuary
Just by looking to the sky
I guess I could have carried her
But I didnt even try
My baby needs an angel
She never learned to fly
Oh I ran so far through a broken land
I was following that drummer
Beating in a different band
And somewhere on the highway
I let go of her hand
Now she s gone forever
Like her footprints in the sand
Toora loora loora lo
First the seed and then the rose
Toora loora loora li
My kingdom for a lullaby
My baby needs a pilot
She has no magic wand
To help her part the troubled waters
Of the Rubicon
But in my soul I know she ll
Have to go this one alone
After all that is only way she s ever known
But there is no lamp in all this dark
That could chase away her shadow
From the corners of my heart
I pray she s ride a dolphin
But she s swimming with the shark
Out where none can save her
Not even Noah and his ark
Toora loora loora lo
To the cradle comes the crow
Toora loora loora li
My kingdom for a lullaby
My baby needs a mother
To love her till the end
Up every rugged mountain
And down every road that bends
Sometimes I hear her cryin
But I guess it s just the wind
My baby needs a mother
To love her till the endHere I go again
Back to that feeling
Of no worthy cause
To carry me on
Cause my hearts been skipping
Like a flat rock on water
And with each ripple
The further Im gone
Some say Im sinking
To the muddy bottom
But somehow Im sailing
To shores of white sand
I feel it raining
And the crosswinds are changing
Blowing my chances
To make it alone
But should you get lonesome
And your child need a mother
Just look for my traces
On shores of white sand
Some say Im sinking
To the muddy bottom
But somehow Im sailing
To shores of white sand
Yes some say Im sinking
To the muddy bottom
But somehow Im sailing
To shores of white sand
Some say Im sinking
To the muddy bottom
But somehow Im sailing
To shores of white sandOh the sisters of mercy
They are not departed or gone
They were waiting for me
When I thought that I just cant go on
And they brought me their comfort
And later they brought me this song
Oh I hope you run into them
You whove been traveling so long
Yes you who must leave everything
That you cannot control
It begins with your family
But soon it comes round to your soul
Well Ive been where youre hanging
And I think I can see how youre pinned
When youre not feeling holy
Your loneliness says that youve sinned
Well they lay down beside me
I make my confessions to them
They touched both my eyes
And I touched the dew on their hem
If your life is a leaf
That the seasons tear off and condemn
They will bind you with love
That is graceful and green as a stem
When I left they were sleeping
And I hope you run into them soon
Dont turn on the lights
You can read their address by the moon
And you wont make me jealous
If I find they have sweetened your night
We werent lovers like that
And besides it would still be all right
We werent lovers like that
And besides it would still be all rightBaby when youre down
Ill be around
Baby when youre lost
Ill be your found
When the night is long
Ill be the crack of dawn
Baby when you take a shot
Ill be your sweet spot
Baby when you need to float
Ill be your lifeboat
When you want to play along
Ill be your Mah Jong
When youve done your best
Ill be your day of rest
Baby when you take a shot
Ill be your sweet spot
Ill be your sweet spot
Baby when youre falling off your feet
Out on a road thats rough and steep
And youre looking for a state of grace
Ill be your leap of faith
Baby when youre growing old
Ill be your solid gold
When your ship dont come in
Ill be your thick and thin
When your love is blind
Ill be your walk the line
When youve given all youve got
Ill be your sweet spotI stand here by the Western Wall
Maybe a little of that wall stands inside us all
I shove my prayers in the crack
Ive got nothing to lose no one to answer back
All these years Ive brought up for review
Wasnt taught this but I learned something new
And to answer the distant call
At the Western Wall
Ive got a heart full of fear
And I offer it up on this altar of tears
Red dust settles deep in my skin
I dont know where it starts and where I begin
Its a crumbling pile of broken stones
It aint much but it might be home
If I ever loved a place at all
Its the Western Wall
I dont know if God was ever a man
But if she was I think I understand
Why he found a place to break his fall
Near the Western WallI am searching through the canyon
It is your name that I am calling
Tho youre so far away
I know you hear my plea
Why wont you answer me
Here I am
I am in the blood of your heart
The breath of your lung
Why do you run for cover
You are from the dirt of the earth
And the kiss of my mouth
I have always been your lover
Here I am
I am the promise never broken
And my arms are ever open
In this harbor calm and still
I will wait until
Until you come to me
Here I amGo to sleep may your sweet dreams come true
Just lay back in my arms for one more night
Ive this crazy old notion that calls me sometimes
Saying this ones the love of our lives
Chorus
Cause I know a love that will never grow old
And I know a love that will never grow old
When you wake up the world may have changed
But trust in me Ill never falter or fail
Just the smile in your eyes it can light up the night
And your laughters like wind in my sails
Chorus
Lean on me let our hearts beat in time
Feel strength from the hands that have held you so long
Who cares where we go on this rutted old road
In a world that may say that were wrong
ChorusTheres a light theres a light in the darkness
And the black of the night cannot harm us
We can trust not to fear for our comfort is near
Theres a light theres a light in the darkness
It will rain it will rain in the desert
In the cracks of the plain theres a treasure
Like the thirst of the seed we will await we believe
It will rain it will rain in the desert
We will fly we will fly we will let go
To this world we will die but our hearts know
Well see more on that side when the door opens wide
We will fly we will fly we will fly we will fly we will all goThe wind is a warning
These fields turn to to sand
My family will not answer me now
Damned damned damned I am
Loving the highway man
Damned damned damned I am
Loving the highway man
Damned damned damned I am
Loving the highway man
Dont say where this ring came from
From whose shaking hands
dont say who lies bleeding for me
Damned damned damned I am
Loving the highway man
Damned damned damned I am
Loving the highway man
Theres a hole in the ceiling
Theres no pleasure in my gain
My heart is in prison
Damned damned damned I am
Loving the highway man
Damned damned damned I am
Loving the highway manYes you loved me and you sold my clothes
I love you but thats the way that it goes
So it goes
Yes you know how I feel
So it goes
It just couldnt be real
And we know its wrong
And I dont think its gonna go on
When I come home carrying my shoes
Ive been waiting to tell you some news
And you want me home all night
And you dont want another fight
But you better love
Find some love
You better love me Jesus Christ
Yes you loved me and you sold all my clothes
I love you baby but thats the way that it goes
So it goes
I guess you know how I feel
So it goes
Yes it couldnt be real
And you want me home all night
You just dont want another fight
But you better love
Find some love
Love me baby Jesus ChristOh my darling I miss you so
How I loved you youll never know
Though its time for me to let you go
Oh my darling Ill miss you so
Cant believe youre really gone for good
I still hold on to places you once stood
I should move on but I never could
Really believe youre gone for good
Oh my friend what could I do
I just came home to bury you
The road is long the road is rough
Your in my heart thats not close enough
All those years disappear
All my tears are not enough not enough
How can it be the ties that bind
Cut down deep and are so unkind
When we lose them we will never find
Anything stronger than the ties that bindOh little town of Bethlehem how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight
For Christ is born of Mary and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together proclaim thy holy birth
And praises sing to God the king and peace to men on earth
Oh little town of Bethlehem how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonightBeautiful Star of Bethlehem
Shining afar through shadows dim
Giving the light to those who long have gone
Guiding the Wise Men on their way
Unto the place where Jesus lay
Beautiful Star of Bethlehem shine on
Oh Beautiful Star Beautiful Beautiful Star
Of Bethlehem Star of Bethlehem
Shine upon us until the glory dawns
Give us the light to light the way
Unto the land of perfect day
Beautiful Star of Bethlehem shine on
Beautiful Star the hope of light
Guiding the pilgrims through the night
Over the mountains til the break of dawn
Into the light of perfect day
It will give out a lovely ray
Beautiful Star of Bethlehem shine on
Oh Beautiful Star Beautiful Beautiful Star
Of Bethlehem Star of Bethlehem
Shine upon us until the glory dawns
Give us the light to light the way
Unto the land of perfect day
Beautiful Star of Bethlehem shine on
Beautiful Star the hope of rest
For the redeemed the good and the blessed
Yonder in glory when the crown is won
Jesus is now that star divine
Brighter and brighter He will shine
Beautiful Star of Bethlehem shine on
Oh Beautiful Star Beautiful Beautiful Star
Of Bethlehem Star of Bethlehem
Shine upon us until the glory dawns
Give us the light to light the way
Unto the land of perfect day
Beautiful Star of Bethlehem shine onOh the night is growing colder
And the stars have lost their shine
And I have been forsaken
By everything I thought was mine
For in the darkest hour
When the final storys told
Chorus
No matter how bright I glittered baby
I could never be gold
You gave up your finest treasure
For the one you saw in me
But how could I know the measure
Of all you needed me to be
Though I came with sweet intentions
More my pockets could not hold
Chorus
I finally gave up counting
The ways you said I let you down
When I fell into that river of no return
And you watched me drown
Oh I could sparkle like a diamond
Have silver line my soul
Chorus
You looked so high and low for heaven
I tried so hard to show the way
But though I flew on wings of angels
My feet were always made of clay
I could come trailing clouds of glory
But you saw nothing to behold
Chorus Tom Slocum
Gliding bird gliding through the sky
Im wondering why I cant be why I cant be as free
Gliding bird gliding all day long
Sing your secret song away from all these faces that I see
Is where I want to be
My feet are so tired
They walked too many miles
If I run so wild like heavens child
Ill learn to fly someday
Gliding bird riding in the sun
Rainbow colors run
I hear the wind
I hear its mournful callThe streets are cracked
And theres glass everywhere
And a baby stares out
With motherless eyes
Under long gone beauty
On fields of war
Trapped in lament
To the poets core
Oh where oh where will I be
Oh where oh when that trumpets sounds
Met an Indian boy in Ottawa
He laid me down on a bed of straw
Said dont waste your breath
Dont waste your heart
Dont	blister your heels
Running in the dark
Oh where oh where will I be
Oh where oh when that trumpets sounds
Yeah I like the heat
Of your body laying under me
May your wild lip get you where your going
With your inventions your intentions your laughter
Your forever yearning
Oh where oh where will I be
Oh where oh when that trumpets sounds
I walked to the river
And I walked to the rim
I walked through the teeth of the reapers grin
I walked to you rolled up in wire
To the other side of desire
Oh where oh where will I be
Oh where oh when that trumpets sounds
Oh where oh where oh where when that trumpet sounds
Oh where oh where oh when that trumpet sounds
Well the heart opens wide like its never seen love
And addiction stays on tight like a glove
Oh where oh where will I beSee what you lost when you left this world this sweet old world
See what you lost when you left this world this sweet old world
The breath from your own lips the touch of fingertips
A sweet and tender kiss
The sound of a midnight train wearing someones ring
Someone calling your name
Somebody so warm cradled in your arm
Didnt you think you were worth anything
See what you lost when you left this world this sweet old world
See what you lost when you left this world this sweet old world
Millions of us in love promises made good
Your own flesh and blood
Looking for some truth dancing with no shoes
The beat the rhythm the blues
The pounding of your hearts drum together with another one
Didnt you think anyone loved youNeil Young
My lifes an open book you read it on the radio
Weve got no where to hide we got no where to go
But if you still decide you want to take a ride
Meet me at the Wrecking ball
Wrecking Ball Ill wear something pretty and white
And well go dancing tonight
Meet me at the Wrecking Ball
Wrecking Ball Ill wear something pretty and white
And well go dancing tonight
I see smokey eyes right across the bar
Ive seen that look before shining from star to star
Though I cant take that change
If youve got time for one danceSongbird in a golden cage
Shed prefer the blue
How I crave the liquor of her song
Poor bird who has done no harm
What harm could she do
She shall be my prisoner her life long
My songbird wants her freedom
Now dont you think I know
But I cant find it in myself
To let my songbird go
I just cant let her go
O lord when your jewelers eye
Peers into my soul
O lord I am overcome with shame
Take me lord and purify
Heal me with a word
Lord I beg a gift I dare not claimThe very first time I ever saw my Tommy love
He came dancing into my room
And I felt the sunlight sparkle warm
Out from his magic shoes
And he danced so proud
And he laughed so wild
And he charmed me like a piper
When he smiled
So dance with me dance with me sing with me cant you see
Im following the rainbow kissed strands of your magic carol
Follow your joyful song anywhere anywhere my raggedy magical music man
For I am only your tag along raggedy anne and I want you to hold me
As long as your raggedy magical music carol can
He asked me if Id like to have my own parade
I answer yes and he blew his golden horn
Then the violins and the trumpets rang out he led them all
In a coat of many colors patched and torn
And he swung me to a loving sound
While the fiddlers played and pranced around
He spun so fast til we left the ground
Then the music filled the heavens with a joyful noise
The stars would dance to greet us as wed come
Then hed wave his hand and send them back to the morning light
And wed keep climbing through the midnight sun
On a rocking horse with wings wed fly
To a place where dreams can never die
Lovers little children in the sky
So dance with me dance with me sing with me cant you see
Im following the rainbow kissed strands of your magic carol
Follow your joyful song anywhere anywhere my raggedy magical music man
For I am only your tag along raggedy-anne and I want you to hold me
As long as your raggedy magical music carol can
And when it came time for my Tommy love to leave
I begged him please to stay and save my soul
And with a fading voice I heard him say as heI meant to ask you how to fix that car
I always meant to ask you about the war
And what you saw across a bridge too far
Did it leave a scar
Or how you navigated wings of fire and steel
Up where heaven had no more secrets to conceal
And still you found the ground beneath your wheels
How did it feel
Bang the drum slowly play the pipe lowly
To dust be returning from dust we begin
Bang the drum slowly Ill speak of things holy
Above and below me world without end
I meant to ask you how when everything seemed lost
And your fate was in a game of dice they tossed
There was still that line that you would never cross
At any cost
I meant to ask you how you lived what you believed
With nothing but your heart up your sleeve
And if you ever really were deceived
By the likes of me
Bang the drum slowly play the pipe lowly
To dust be returning from dust we begin
Bang the drum slowly Ill speak of things holy
Above and below me world without end
Gone now is the day and gone the sun
There is peace tonight all over Arlington
But the songs of my life will still be sung
By the light of the moon you hung
I meant to ask you how to plow that field
I meant to bring you water from the well
And be the one beside you when you fell
Could you tell
Bang the drum slowly play the pipe lowly
To dust be returning from dust we begin
Bang the drum slowly Ill speak of things holy
Above and below me world without endCall happy calling children are falling
In line to ride on the merry-go-round
People are passing children are laughing
They want to ride on the merry-go-round
Doesnt matter when you came
Every ride is just the same
Do not worry how its done
There is room for everyone
Carousel turning children are yearning
To ride it forever and never come down
Little ones singing older ones clinging
Everyone riding the merry-go-round
Go round and round and up and down
Round and round they go always reaching for the ring of gold
Never knowing when the musics over they will be old
Call happy calling children are falling
In line to ride on the merry-go-round
People are passing children are laughing
They want to ride on the merry-go-round
Sometimes up and sometimes down
Dont let your feet ever touch the ground
Sometimes right and sometimes wrong
Youll end up where you belong
Sound of their laughter makes the ride faster
Soon the circus stand must come down
Music grows nowhere the ride is over
Say goodbye to the merry-go-roundSad eyes sad eyes
Wherere you going with that confidence
Sad eyes sad eyes
Wherere you going with that confidence
Im going to where the boats go by
Caledonia river flow so wide
Im going to where the boats go by
Caledonia river flow so wide
Still water laying over
Still water laying over
Still water laying over
Caledonia river oh so wide
Wild eyes in the wilderness
Wherere you going with the devil in hand
Wild eyes in the wilderness
Wherere you going with the devil in hand
Im going to build the bridges high
For working money for working money
Im going to climb the bridges high
Caledonia brother far away
Still water Im laying over
Still water lay my body down over
Still water laying over
Caledonia river far away
Sad eyes in the weary night
Have you seen your brother
Have you seen your brother
Waiting by the river Grand
Caledonia river oh so wide
Going to where the rain falls
Look for my brother
Look for my brother
Going to where the rain falls
Caledonia river far away
Still water laying over
Still water lay my body down
Still water laying over
Caledonia river far awaytwo smiling faces
thats how it use to beThere where no cuckoos no sycamores
We played about the forest floor
Underneath the silver maples the balsams and the sky
We popped the heads off dandelions
Assuming roles from nursery rhymes
Rested on the riverbank
And grew up by and by and grew up by and by
Frail my heart apart
And play me a little shady grove
Ring the bells of rhymney
Till they ring inside my head forever
Bounce the bow rock the gallows
For the hangmans reel
And wake the devil from his dream
Im going back to Harlan
Im going back to Harlan
Im going back to Harlan
And if you were Willie Moore
And I was Barbara Allen
Or Fair Ellen all sad at the cabin door

Nothing can go wrong

My sweet waterfall
When I go
When I go down deep
I want you here with me
My sweet waterfall

A rainbow calling me
Through your mystery
My sweet waterfall
Waterfall
For a million day
Fall with me for a million days
My sweet waterfall
Waterfall
Nothing can go wrong

My sweet waterfall
Nothing can go wrong

When it carries the sound of a thousand goodbyes
But if you listen tonight on that high lonely plain
Youll just hear my voice as it calls out your name
Youll just hear my voice as it calls out your name
Youve been on a road that just dont seem to end
Where that broken old heart of yours wont ever mend
Youve crossed over bridges and bridges they burn
So many rivers and so much to learn
So many bridges and so much to learn
But the moon is so full the stars are so bright
And my hand is steady my touch id light
Look in my eyes hold on real tight
And Ill waltz you my darling across Texas tonight
Ill waltz you my darling across Texas tonight
We both have known hard luck
And love thats gone wrong
When the ghosts take the shadows and
The night takes too long
We folded our cards when the hand wasnt strong
But that wheel will keep spinning long after were gone
Yeah that wheel will keep spinning long after were gone
And the moon is so full the stars are so bright
And my hand is steady my touch is light
Look in my eyes hold on real tight and Ill
Waltz you my darling across Texas tonight
Ill waltz you my darling across Texas tonight
Look in my eyes hold on real tight
And Ill waltz you my darling across Texas tonight
Ill waltz you my darling across texas tonightDaniel Lanois
Well I work the double shift
In a bookstore on St Clair
While he pushed the burning ingots
In Dofasco stinking air
Where the truth bites and stings
I remember just what we were
As the noon bell rings for
Blackhawk and the white winged dove
Hold on to your aching heart
Ill wipe the liquor from your lips
A small town hero never dies
He fades a bit and then he slips
Down into the blast furnace
In the heat of the open hearth
And at the punch clock he remembers
Blackhawk and the white winged dove
I remember your leather boots
Pointing up into the sky
We fell down to our knees
Over there where the grass grew high
Love hunters in the night
Our faces turned into the wind
Blackhawk where are you know
Blackhawk and the white winged dove
We were Blackhawk where are you know
We were Blackhawk where are you knowWhen I go dont cry for me
In my fathers arms Ill be
The wounds this world left on my soul
Will all be healed and Ill be whole
Sun and moon will be replaced
With the light of Jesus face
And I will not be ashamed
For my savior knows my name
It dont matter where you bury me
Ill be home and Ill be free
It dont matter where I lay
All my tears be washed away
Gold and silver blind the eye
Temporary riches lie
Come and eat from heavens store
Come and drink and thirst no more
So weep not for me my friend
When my time below does end
For my life belongs to him
Who will raise the dead again
It dont matter where you bury me
Ill be home and Ill be free
It dont matter where I lay
All my tears be washed awayIn the time of my confession in the hour of my deepest need
When the pool of tears beneath my feet flood every newborn seed
Theres a dyin voice within me reaching out somewhere
Toiling in the danger and in the morals of despair
Dont have the inclination to look back on any mistake
Like cain I now behold this chain of events that I must break
In the fury of the moment I can see the masters hand
In every leaf that trembles and in every grain of sand
Oh the flowers of indulgence and the weeds of yesteryear
Like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer
The sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way
To ease the pain of idleness and the memory of decay
I gaze into the doorway of temptations angry flame
And every time I pass that way I always hear my name
Then onward in my journey I come to understand
That every hair is numbered like every grain of sand
I have gone from rags to riches in the sorrow of the night
In the violence of a summers dream in the chill of a wintry light
In the bitter dance of loneliness fading into space
In the broken mirror of innocence on each forgotten face
I hear the ancient footsteps like the motion of the sea
Sometimes I turn theres someone there other times its only me
I am hanging in the balance of a perfect finished plan
Like every sparrow falling like every grain of sandA house not a home was a picture satin painted
For sweet little sister and me
Our daddy would frown while mother was praying
His heart was so hardened that he would not believe
In anger hed swear his voice cold and loud
His Sundays were spent out with the gamblin crowd
Ive never seen my daddy inside a house of God
For Satin held his hand down the path of sin he trod
Not long ago our circle was broken
When God called on mother one night
In a voice sweet and low her last words were spoken
Asking our daddy to raise her children right
The angels rejoiced in heaven last night
I heard my daddy praying dear God make it right
He was smiling and singing with tears in his eyes
While mother with the angels rejoiced last night
While mother with the angels rejoiced last nightI remember holdin on to you
All them long and lonely nights I put you through
Somewhere in there Im sure I made you cry
But I cant remember if we said goodbye
But I recall all of them nights down in Mexico
One place I may never go in my life again
Was I just off somewhere or just too high
But I cant remember if we said goodbye
I only miss you every now and then
Like the soft breeze blowin up from the Caribbean
Most Novembers I break down and cry
Cause I cant remember if we said goodbye
But I recall all of them nights down in Mexico
One place I will never go in my life again
Was I just off somewhere or just too high
But I cant remember if we said goodbye
No I cant remember if we said goodbye
Goodbye
GoodbyeMary took to running with a travelin man
Left her momma crying with her head in her hands
Such a sad case so broken hearted
She say momma I got to go I gotta get outta here
I gotta get out of town Im tired of hanging around
I gotta roll on between the ditches
Its just an ordinary story bout the way things go
Round and around nobody knows but the highway
Goes on forever that ol highway rolls on forever
Lord she never wouldve done it if she hadnt got drunk
If she hadnt started running with a travelin man
If she hadnt started taking those crazy changes
She say daughter let me tell you bout the travelin kind
Everywhere hes goin such a very short time
Hell be long gone before you know it hell be long
Gone before you know it
She say never have I known it when it felt so good
Never have I knew it when I knew I could
Never have I done it when it looked so right
Leaving Louisiana in the broad daylight
This is down in the swampland anything goes
Its alligator bait and the bars dont close
Its the real thing down in Louisiana
Did you ever see a cajun when he really got mad
When he really got trouble like a daughter gone bad
It gets real hot down in Louisiana
The stranger better move it or hes gonna get killed
Hes gonna have to get it or a shotgun will
It aint no time for lengthy speeches
There aint no time for lengthy speeches
She say never have I know it when it felt so good
Never have I knew it when I knew I could
Never have I done it when it looked so right
Leaving Louisiana in the broad daylight
Its just an ordinary story bout the way things go
Round and around nobody knows but the highway goes on forever
There aint no way to stop the waterRodney Crowell
Shes a rounder I can tell you that
She can sing em all night too
Shell raise hell about the sleep she lost
But even cowgirls get the blues
Especially cowgirls theyre the gypsy kind
And need their laid on em loose
Shes lived to see the world turned upside down
Hitchin rides out of the blues
But even cowgirls get the blues sometimes
Bound to dont know what to do sometimes
Get this feelin like shes too far gone
The only way shes ever been
Lonely nights are out there on the road
Motel ceiling stares you down
There must be safer ways to pay your dues
But even cowgirls get the blues
Even cowgirls get the blues sometime
Bound to dont know what to do sometimes
Get this feelin like shes too far gone
The only way shes ever been
Even cowgirls get the blues sometime
Bound to dont know what to do sometimes
Get this feelin like the restless wind
The only way shes ever beenLuxury liner forty tons of steel
If I dont find my baby now
I guess I never will
Ive been a long lost soul
For a long long time
Ive been around
Everybody ought to know whats on my mind
You think Im lonesome so do I
So do I
Well Im the kind of girl
Who likes to make a livin runnin round

How still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep
The silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth
The everlasting Light
The hopes and fears of all the years
Are met in thee tonight
For Christ is born of Mary
And gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep
Their watch of wondering love
O morning stars together
Proclaim the holy birth
And praises sing to God the King
And Peace to men on earth
Away in a manger
No crib for a bed
The little Lord Jesus
Lay down His sweet head
The stars in the sky
Look down where He lay
The little Lord Jesus
Asleep on the hay
Asleep on the hay

The ways of the world are feeble
Dont give up on simple people
Angel eyes
The blues you can live without
Its not what you songs about
Angel eyes angel eyes
Tell me what would we do without
No light from angel eyes
You can move the hearts of men
Just with a phrase youre turning
Since hearts ever have been yearning and so alone
Thin lines youve been living on
Are so close to the danger zoneAway in a manger
No crib for his bed
The little Lord Jesus
Laid down his sweet head
The stars in the bright sky
Looked down where he lay
The little Lord Jesus
Asleep on the hay
The cattle are lowing
The baby awakes
But little Lord Jesus
No crying he makes
I love you Lord Jesus
Look down from the sky
And stay by my cradle
Til morning is nighThe first Noel the angel did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay keeping their sheep
On a cold winters night that was so deep
Noel Noel Noel Noel
Born is the King of Israel
They looked up and saw a star
Shining in the the East beyond them far
And to the Earth it gave great light
And so it continued both day and night
Noel Noel Noel Noel
Born is the King of Israel
This star drew night to the northwest
Oer Bethlehem it took its rest
And there it did both stop and stay
Right over the place where Jesus lay
