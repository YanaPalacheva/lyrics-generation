Mr Ruskin come and paint my picture
Were losing sleep cos we steal the week
Now whos your best friend
Can you introduce me
See I cant seem to even let you breathe
When I dance with Billy Ruskin in my minds eye
Please let me forget that Im standing on my own
And I am my own best friend and I need me to see
That I am more than what is hiding in me
Come and show me if you can
See I know youre me
But I cant seem to understand
If you know me place my hand on mine
And we will resurrect the time
That we lost when you left my mind
Its psycho-paranoia disappearing in time
Come and show me what makes you tick
I need you to get out of my mind quick
When I dance with Billy Ruskin in my minds eye
Please let me forget that Im standing on my own
And I am my own best friend and I need me to see
That I am more than what is hiding in meMade of clay
Shoot me down
Ill ricochet to the ground
Words of paint
Draw me out
And fill me in with your mouth
And hold your tongue
And I know its over before its begun
I lost my way
So help me out
And lend your hand til I am found
My voice is mute
Not to be heard
So its up to you
For you to bring those words
I
And I
Have come undone
For the last time
This grief you give
It takes its toll
It dries my heart and drowns my soul
I am a tree
Whose branch you broke
The brittle wood has turned stones oh
I
And I
Have come undone
For the last time
For the last time
For the last time
I
And I
Have come undone
For the last time
For the last time
For the last timeOh misty eye of the mountain below
Keep careful watch of my brothers souls
And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke
Keep watching over Durins sons
If this is to end in fire
Then we should all burn together
Watch the flames climb high into the night
Calling out father oh stand by and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on
The mountain side high
And if we should die tonight
We should all die together
Raise a glass of wine for the last time
Calling out father oh
Prepare as we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on
The mountain side
Desolation comes upon the sky
Now I see fire
Inside the mountain
I see fire
Burning the trees
And I see fire
Hollowing souls
I see fire
Blood in the breeze
And i hope that youll remember me
Oh should my people fall then
Surely Ill do the same
Confined in mountain halls
We got too close to the flame
Calling out father oh
Hold fast and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on
The mountain side
Desolation comes upon the sky
Now I see fire
Inside the mountains
I see fire
Burning the trees
And I see fire
Hollowing souls
I see fire
Blood in the breeze
And I hope that youll remember me
And if the night is burning
I will cover my eyes
For if the dark returns then
My brothers will die
And as the sky is falling down
It crashed into this lonely town
And with that shadow upon the ground
I hear my people screaming out
And I see fire
Inside the mountains
I see fire
Burning the trees
I see fire
Hollowing souls
I see fire
Blood in the breeze
I see fire fire
Oh you know I saw a city burning out
And I see fire fire
Feel the heat upon my skin
And I see fire fire
Uhhhhhhhhh
And I see fire
Burn auburn on the mountain sideShorty get down good Lord

No diggity I got to bag it upIf you were here beside me
Instead of in New York
If the curve of you was curved on me
Id tell you that I loved you
Before I even knew you
Cause I loved the simple thought of you
If our hearts had never broken
Well theres no joy in the mending
So much this hurt can teach us both
Theres distance and theres silence
Your words have never left me
Theyre the prayer that I say every day
Come on come out come here come here
Come on come out come here come here
Come on come out come here come here
Come on come out come here come here
The lone neon lights
And the heat of the ocean
And the fire that had started to spark
I miss it all from the love to the lightning
And the lack of it snaps me in two
If you were here beside me
Instead of New York
In the arms you said youd never leave
Id tell you that its simple
And it was only ever thus
There is nowhere else that I belong
Come on come out come here come here
Come on come out come here come here
Come on come out come here come here
Come on come out come here come here
The lone neon lights
And the want of the ocean
And the fire that had started to spark
I miss it all from the love to the lightning
And the lack of it snaps me in two
Just give me a sign
There is end in a beginning
Til the quiet chaos driving me mad
The lone neon lights
And the want of the ocean
And the fire that had started to go outNow Im in town break it down thinking of making a new sound
Playing a different show every night in front of a new crowd
Thats you now ciao seems that life is great now
See me lose focus as I sing to you loud
And I cant no I wont hush
Ill say the words that make you blush
Im gonna sing this now
See Im true my songs are where my heart is
Im like glue I stick to other artists
Im not you now that would be disastrous
Let me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures
See Im real I do it all its all me
Im not fake dont ever call me lazy
I wont stay put give me the chance to be free
Suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me
Cause you need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you at all
You need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you at all
You need me
I sing and write my own tune
And I write my own verso
Dont need another word-smith to make my tune sell
Call yourself a singer-writer Youre just bluffing
Your names on the credits and you didnt write nothing
I sing fast I know that all my shits cool
I will blast and I didnt go to Brit School
I came fast with the way I act right
I cant last if Im smoking on a crack pipe
And I wont be a product of my genre
My mind will always be stronger than my songs are
Never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya
Always read the stories that you hear on Wikipedia
And musically Im demonstrating
When I perform live feels like I am meditating
Times at the Enterprise when some fella filmed me
A young singer-writer like Gabriella Cilmi
Cause you need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you at all
You need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you at all
You need me
Cause with the lyrics Ill be aiming it right
I wont stop till my names in light
At Stadium Heights with Damien Rice
On red carpets now Im on arabian nights
Because Im young and all my brothers gonna give me advice
Long nighter short height and Im gone hyper
Never be anything but a singer-songwriter
The games over but now Im on a new level
Watch how I step on the track without a loop pedal
People think that Im bound to blow up
Ive done around about a thousand shows
But I havent got a house plus I live on the couch
So you can be the lyrics when Im singing them out wow
From day one Ive been prepared
With Vfive wax for my ginger hair
So now Im back to the sofa giving a dose of what the future holds
Cause its another day plus Ill keep my last name forever keep the genre pretty basic
Gonna be breaking into other peoples tunes when I chase it
And replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift
Into another rappers shoes using new laces
Selling cds from my rucksack aiming for the papers
Selling cds from my rucksack aiming for majors
Nationwide til were just jack soon as I get the bus back
Clean cut kid without a razor for the mustache
I hit back when the pen hurts me
Im still a choir boy in a French church tee
Im still the same as a year ago
But more people hear me though
According to the myspace and youtube videos
Im always doing shows if Im not Im in the studio
Truly broke never growing up call me Ruffio
Melody music maker
Reading all the papers
They say Im up and coming like Im fucking in an elevator
Cause you need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you at all
You need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you at all
You need me man I dont need youSo so you think you can tell
Heaven from Hell
Blue skys from pain
Can you tell a green field
From a cold steel rail
A smile from a veil
Do you think you can tell
And did they get you to trade
Your heroes for ghosts
Hot ashes for trees
Hot air for a cool breeze
Cold comfort for change
And did you exchange
A walk on part in the war
For a lead role in a cage
How I wish how I wish you were here
Were just two lost souls
Swimming in a fish bowl
Year after year
Running over the same old ground
What have we found
The same old fears
Wish you were hereOf all the money that eer I had
Ive spent it in good company
And all the harm that eer Ive done
Alas it was to none but me
And all Ive done for want of wit
To memory now I cant recall
So fill to me the parting glass
Good night and joy be with you all
Of all the comrades that eer I had
They are sorry for my going away
And all the sweethearts that eer I had
They would wish me one more day to stay
But since it falls unto my lot
That I should rise and you should not
Ill gently rise and Ill softly call
Good night and joy be with you all
A man may drink and not be drunk
A man may fight and not be slain
A man may court a pretty girl and perhaps be welcomed back again
But since it has so ought to be
By a time to rise and a time to fall
Come fill to me the parting glass
Good night and joy be with you all
Good night and joy be with you allYou look so wonderful in your dress
I love your hair like that
The way it falls on the side of your neck
Down your shoulders and back
We are surrounded by all of these lies
And people who talk too much
Youve got that kind of look in your eyes
As if no one knows anything but us
And should this be the last thing I see
I want you to know its enough for me
Cause all that you are is all that Ill ever need
Im so in love so in love
So in love so in love
You look so beautiful in this light
Your silhouette over me
The way it brings out the blue in your eyes
Is the Tenerife sea
And all of the voices surrounding us here
They just fade out when you take a breath
Just say the word and I will disappear
Into the wilderness
And should this be the last thing I see
I want you to know its enough for me
Cause all that you are is all that Ill ever need
Im so in love so in love
So in love so in love
Lumiere darling
Lumiere over me
Lumiere darling
Lumiere over me
Lumiere darling
Lumiere over me
And should this be the last thing I see
I want you to know its enough for me
Cause all that you are is all that Ill ever need
Im so in love so in love
So in love love love love
So in love
You look so wonderful in your dress
I loved your hair like that
And in the moment I knew you BethI keep my hopes and dreams inside of you amongst the other things my mother seems to never see the bruises that Im covering
Never been known by my government name my foster home is where Ive been placed away from the pain
So as you sit before me with a folder holding my story youre my savior with nothing on me but power and glory
And surely youll never ignore cos when the the court came the court date was made to disappear for me
You think you understand me but never what I went through but you were never meant to I wont hold it against you
I take a ballpoint pen to play dot to dot with the cigarette burns etched in my forearms
Forget me not never let me stop youll just sit and watch its your job to be patient so youll let me off
So come with me take a walk on the wild side see life in a day through a childs eyes
And these dreams are all I have to hold me
When sleeps the only thing that I want to take me away away
Okay sessions over time to get back to the classroom I hate this lesson and I guess the teacher finds it hard to
You told me I should try my best but guess what I still find this trigonometry a head fuck
Constantly told I wont pass my GCSEs
Ill end up in Mac Ds serving burgers and cheese
But you told me I can do anything if I put my mind to it
Mistakes make a change if you put a line through em
Lately classmates think Im crazy turn up daily resembling bill bailey
And I aint saying that I cant be groomed with it without new clothes or shower it hard to do
So after school youll take me shopping for some new clothes but theyll get taken off me when I get back to the group home
So come with me take a walk on the wild side see life in a day through a childs eyes
And these dreams are all I have to hold me
When sleeps the only thing that I want to take me away awayCant get you off my mind
Look at me and you will find
Time after time it seems
Ill say what I dont mean
In your world we were the same
In mine now youre the one to blame
You cant remember my name
Were lost its such a shame
Listen to me
Stop making me see
What Ive been waiting for
Listen to me
Stop making me see
Im strong yet proud
Im quiet yet loud
And Im everything
You want in me
Im small yet tall
I have it all
And Im everything
You want me to be
Listen to me
Stop making me see
What Ive been waiting for
Listen to me
Stop making me see
And I still feel like
I need you still
And I still feel like
Im on some pill
And I still feel like
I need you still
Listen to me
Stop making me see
What Ive been waiting for
Listen to me
Making me seeCould I wake up next to you when were hitting double figures
Look into your eyes like Im looking into double mirrors
Could you make it any clearer Everythings such a blur
Its not my turn its hers to get hurt
On a late night coming home from way too many train rides
Lace not as red as my face Im home at the same time
Highbury estates fine
Smoking like a dragon but dont chase lines
I havent slept for the past week
Two hours aint enough for me
I feel inspired at quarter to three am
I havent changed since our last meet
Im still getting all my meals for free
Think Im being shunned by my feet again
Its not a homeless life for me
Its just Im home less than Id like to be
And now Im sitting on a night bus flicking through my Ipod
Feeling kinda tired so I try to close my eyes up
Driver turn the lights off lights on on stage mics on
Song plays nice one gotta keep my hype strong
Truth be never went to Uni
People see right through me but Im not a fool see
Im never gonna do one gonna live past twenty-two done
Everything I need to except get a twenty-one
I havent slept for the past week
Two hours aint enough for me
I feel inspired at quarter to three am
I havent changed since our last meet
Im still getting all my meals for free
Think Im being shunned by my feet again
Its not a homeless life for me
Its just Im home less than Id like to be
When I feel cold you keep me warm
And Im not looking for some loose change
Just wanna find a true mate
Who wants to be my duvet
Its not a homeless life for me
Its just Im home less than Id like to beI fell in love next to you
Burning fires in this room
It just fits light and smooth
Like my feet in my shoes
Little one lie with me
Sew you heart to my sleeve
Well stay quiet underneath
Shooting stars if it helps you sleep
And hold me tight dont let me breathe
Feeling like you wont believe
Theres a firefly loose tonight
Better catch it before it burns this place down
And I lie if I dont feel so right
But the world looks better through your eyes
Theres a firefly loose tonight
Better catch it before it burns this place down
And I lie if I dont feel so right
But the world looks better through your eyes
Teach my skin those new tricks
Warm me up with your lips
Heart to heart melt me down
Its too cold in this town
Close your eyes lean on me
Face to mouth lips to cheek
Feeling numb in my feet
Youre the one
To help me get to sleep
And hold me tight dont let me breathe
Feeling like you wont believe
Theres a firefly loose tonight
Better catch it before it burns this place down
And I lie if I dont feel so right
But the world looks better through your eyes
Theres a firefly loose tonight
Better catch it before it burns this place down
And I lie if I dont feel so right
But the world looks better through your eyes
Its only been one night of love
And maybe that is not enough
Hold me tight dont let me breathe
Feeling like you wont believe
Its only been one night of love
And maybe that is not enough
Hold me tight dont let me breathe
Feeling like you wont believe
Theres a firefly loose tonight
Better catch it before it burns this place down
And I lie if I dont feel so right
But the world looks better through your eyes
Theres a firefly loose tonight
Better catch it before it burns this place down
And I lie if I dont feel so right
But the world looks better through your eyesFilled up with doubt
I have to move home
But I want to stay with you
For all of the summer
I have my plan
That you wont remember
If you want to see the world
Then please ask your mother
I cannot hold your hand
To watch you go
I am a liar
As you might know
I need you now
I need your touch
And your lips
I need that smile
And your kiss
Youre so cool
Youre so beautiful
Youre so
Youre so
Youre so cool
Youre so beautiful
Youre so
Youre so
I see your grace
From my window
When it is late at night
Itll show me your shadow
Im in my place
Hope you remember
When summers gone
Ill still sing a song
Of you in September
I cannot hold your hand
To watch you go
I am a liar
As you might know
I need you now
I need your touch
And your lips
I need that smile
And your kiss
Youre so cool
Youre so beautiful
Youre so
Youre so
Youre so cool
Youre so beautiful
Youre so
Youre so
These words I say mean
Youre so amazing
And Ive noticed lately
I need you maybe
These words I say mean
Youre so amazing
And Ive noticed lately
I need you maybe
Cause youre so cool
Youre so beautiful
Youre so
Youre soI am a poor wayfaring stranger
Traveling through this world alone
And theres no sickness toil or danger
In that bright land to which I go
And Im going there to see my mother
And Im going there no more to roam
And Im only going over Jordan
And Im only going over home now
Extra voice addition
Hey - ey - ey Yeah 
And I know dark clouds will gather round me
And I know my way is rough and steep
And the beautiful fields lie just beyond me
And I know my needs are rough and steep
And Im going there to see my mother
And Im going there no more to roam
And Im only going over Jordan
And Im only going over home now
Cause I am a poor wayfaring stranger
Traveling through this world alone
And theres no sickness toil or danger
In that bright light to which I go
And Im going there to see my mother
And Im going there no more to roam
And Im only going over Jordan
And Im only going over home nowFor fucks sake
Living the life of a student
Yeah I begin on a high
Losing my mind
And they say that Ive been winning for time
Never been to a gun fight never needed a knife
But then I make the cut whenever delivering the lines
Sit on the side with a rhyme pad
With a tin in my sights
Sipping a lemon and lime Corona only with my best friends
Cause I paid in my pride
Giving the time to write rhymes
But I find truth at a quarter to five eh
Its kinda like I took a train
To the left side of my brain oh mayne
Toddle some mud under my door
You know Im stepping in my own lane
All of these speakers sitting behind me
But what psychology psychologically insane
Part of me wanna get down down down
Making you go low inside
You dont know if you dont know by now
You better tell him bout it
What you gonna tell him bout it
Yeah yeah
Ten toes to the dirt
Pencil to the paper
God has a favor for your thirst
Drink-drink ya pint bye-bye
To this bullshit praise Allah
To the wheels Im a ridah
Steering your Prada
Only closed in my Ada-di-das
Im a fetus in my boom sake nana
Daddys home on the mic hey papa
Back with my bang yo straight loop on my pedal no band though
But every single one of my fans know that
Every damn show Im taking their ears on a journey
Like Im flying overseas with Van Gogh
Livin so sweet without Gretel and Hansel
Critics hate the lyrics cause they think Ive been tangoed
Find me wearing old clothes rocking a Kangol
Im riding round with Yelawolf in your daddys Lambo
Hello me how ya been
You got a mullet again like when you was ten
Youre probably sipping sweet tees you still huh
And your piggy bank is full of change
Fact what you used to steal from
You been playing fools like a steel drum
Pulling out early and they still come
Eating from the game when you know the meals done
Yelawolf is kicking back at these pilgrims
Hold up baby sit still son
Whoa this old rock it heals been rolled
Still shocking when I see em go
Bananas and they hammer the
Living the life of a student
Yeah I begin on a high
Losing my mind
And they say that Ive been winning for time
Never been to a gun fight never needed a knife
But then I make the cut whenever delivering the lines
Sit on the side with a rhyme pad
With a tin in my sights
Sipping a lemon and lime Corona only with my best friends
Cause I paid in my pride
Giving the time to write rhymes
But I find truth at a quarter to five eh
Im not the average half wit
After this hour gets out of this
sixty seconds Im going in any directions
And chasing this jack with a shot of Budweiser and water
Its probably the better idea you move the direction in
Fact its a part of me to be the looser of cannons
Blowing his fucking mics like the winds
I caught this cardigan
Hooligans hooligans hooligans
But really whos a friend
Jump in this little fire jump right back in the pool again
Know I be new again
A student of you my friend
Marshall Mathers Im tossing rappers up at my crew of ten
Minus four minus war
You dont want it
Shady records Im already better fuck it doggonnit
Dog dont gotta lead
Dogs already home
Jack dog Im a beast Im a wolf
Bring your dogs back
A melody man in a melancholic mellow yellow can
Sh tell him how we gonna sell em man
Been working hard all week
So if you wonder if we earned it well its not a probably
So wont you bring that back to me
And holla when you hear it like all the screams of a Halloween
I got blisters on my feet
To walk in night with you is not the shoes to be borrowing
So wont you bring that back to me
Cause all the sole of my pin is what all the sorrow brings
If you dont know if you dont know no no no
If you dont know if you dont know no no no
If you dont know if you dont know no no no
If you dont know if you dont know no no noWill you recognise me in the flashing lights
I try to keep my heart beat but I cant get it right
Will you recognise me when Im laying on my back
Somethings gone inside me and it aint coming back now
Oh heaven oh heaven I wait with good intention now
But the day it always lasts too long mm then Im gone
Oh heaven oh heaven I wait with good intention now
But the day it always lasts too long woah
Then Im gone  woo woo woo wooo
Will you recognise me when Im stealing from the poor
Youre not gonna like me no Im nothing like before wow
And will you recognise me when I lose another friend
Will you learn to leave me or give me one more try again
Oh heaven oh heaven I wait with good intention now
But the day it always lasts too long woah then Im gone
Oh heaven oh heaven I wait with good intention now
But the day it always lasts too long now
Then Im gone  now woo woo woo wooo
Baby be mine now mm mm mmm
Oh heaven oh heaven I wait with good intention now
But the day it always lasts too long mm then Im gone
Oh heaven oh heaven I wait with good intention now
But the day it always lasts too long wow

If you snitchin I go loco
Hit you with that treinta ocho
Niggas thinkin that Im solo
fifty deep theyre like oh no
Heard the feds takin photos
I know nothin fuck the popo
Im in love with the coco
I got it for the low low
thirty-six thats a kilo
Need a brick miss my free throw
Im in love just like Ne-Yo
Bustin shots now he Neo
Free my homies fuck the CO
Fuck the judge fuck my PO
All this coke like Im Nino
Water whip Im like Nemo
Bakin soda I got bakin soda
Bakin soda I got bakin soda
Whip it through the glass nigga
Im blowin money fast nigga
Im in love with the coco
I got it for the low lowI wanna be drunk when I wake up
On the right side of the wrong bed
And every excuse I made up
Tell you the truth I hate
What didnt kill me
It never made me stronger at all
Love will scar your make-up lip sticks to me
So now Ill maybe leave back there
Im sat here wishing I was sober
I know Ill never hold you like I used to
But our house gets cold when you cut the heating
Without you to hold Ill be freezing
Cant rely on my heart to beat it
Cause you take part of it every evening
Take words out of my mouth just from breathing
Replace with phrases like when youre leaving me
Should I should I
Maybe Ill get drunk again
Ill be drunk again
Ill be drunk again
To feel a little love
I wanna hold your heart in both hands
Ill watch it fizzle at the bottom of a Coke can
And Ive got no plans for the weekend
So shall we speak then
Keep it between friends
Though I know youll never love me like you used to
There maybe other people like us
You see the flicker of the clip when they light up
Flames just create us burns dont heal like before
You dont hold me anymore
On cold days Coldplays out like the bands the name
I know I cant heal things with a hand shake
You know I cant change as I began saying
You cut me wide open like landscape
Open bottles of beer but never champagne
To applaud you with the sound that my hands make
Should I should I
Maybe Ill get drunk again
Ill be drunk again
Ill be drunk again
To feel a little love
All by myself
Im here again
All by myself
You know Ill never change
All by myself
All by myself
Im just drunk again
Ill be drunk again
Ill be drunk again
To feel a little loveI found your hairband on my bedroom floor
The only evidence that youve been here before
And I dont get waves of missing you anymore
Theyre more like tsunami tides in my eyes
Never getting dry so I get high smoke in the day then I sleep with the light on
Weeks pass in the blink of an eye
And Im still drunk by the end of the night
I dont drink like everybody else
End up forgetting things about myself
Im stubborn Im forward heads just blocked
My heads still with you but my hearts just not
So am I close to you anymore if its over
And theres no chance that well work it out
Thats why you and I ended over U-N-I
And I said thats fine but youre the only one that knows I lied
You and I ended over U-N-I
And I said thats fine but youre the only one that knows I lied
Everybody said that well be together forever but I know that
I never wanna settle down come around break up the love like Lego now
Never wanna turn into another like you
Sleep with my thoughts dance with my views
Everythings great but everythings short
But you live in your halls and I live in a tour bus
Now Im in position to be another stalker
And every thing I say seems to always sound awkward
Like our last kiss it was perfect but we were nervous
On the surface
And Im always saying everyday that it was worth it
Pain is only relevant if it still hurts
I forget like an elephant or we can use a sedative
And go back to the day we fell in love on first kiss
So am I close to you anymore if its over
And theres no chance that well work it out
Oh you and I ended over U-N-I
And I said thats fine but youre the only one that knows I lied
You and I ended over U-N-I
And I said thats fine but youre the only one that knows I lied
Because if I was gonna go somewhere Id be there by now
And maybe I can let myself down oh
And thinking I am unaware I keep my feet on the ground
Keep looking around to make sure Im not he only one to feel low
Because if you want Ill take you in my arms
And keep you sheltered from all that Ive done wrong
And I know youll say that Im the only one
But I know that god made another one of me
To love you better than I ever will
Cause you and I ended over U-N-I
And I said thats fine but youre the only one that knows I lied
You and I ended over U-N-I
And I said thats fine but youre the only one that knows I liedUnhappy days
That left us on the floor
And you breathe me
Till youre not feeling sure
Everything will brighten up
If we go to Brighton
Ill take you along the Pier
Everything will lighten up
If you feel too frightened
Ill make it disappear dear
Darling dont be nervous
Ill understand
If youll let me go
I did this on purpose
Now when Im missing you
Ill stop eating food
And Ill squeeze into a dress
So I can be like you
And then Ill see your bitterness
And why youre leaving too
Maybe Ill put you to a test
And say that I love you
I think that I love you
Sunny days
That left my skin dark red
You squeeze me
Till these thoughts leave my head
If it gets too complicated
Ill give up and be frustrated
Can you see whats wrong
If you feel like youve been hated
This loves too overrated
See whats going on on
Darling dont be nervous
Ill understand
If youll let me go
I did this on purpose
Now when Im missing you
Ill stop eating food
And Ill squeeze into a dress
So I can be like you
And then Ill see your bitterness
And why youre leaving too
Maybe Ill put you to a test
And say that I love you
I think that I love you
Take me back to live at home
Take me back to Albert Road
Now Im missing you
Ive stopped eating food
And Ive squeezed into your dress
So I can feel like you
But then I saw your bitterness
And why you left me too
I thought Id put you to a test
And say that I love you
I think that I love you
And I stopped eating food
And I squeezed into your dress
So I could feel like you
But then I saw your bitterness
And why you left me too
Maybe Ill put you to a test
And say that I love you
Now it seems you loved me tooListen Little Lady this is just the worst way to spend your birthday
Its thirty degrees Thursday you work late
You was with a perv making dirty fake love in his Mercedes
Maybe the word rape sums up events that take place every night
You wanna get up but you know your legs will ache if you tryHey
Can you hear me
I just wanted to let you know
Hm
I hope you can hear what I write to you
How could I say goodbye to you
When Im a life that came out of the inside of a life that was inside of you
I gotta respect the way you provided food for the whole fam
You came over a moon rush supporting a mar jays old man
Cold double eight eight kids bare wheels
Plus racists full of hatred in your own plant
three jobs in a day
Rest in life in you working but you were never stress free
Just locked in a cage slaving
They said they were gold in the pavements
But you came and saw the road to amazement
Broke your heart
But still you were prone to last and your sorrow was over fast
I hope your listening right
I still think of you every Sunday
No one can top your chicken and rice
Even through the darkness times
You held us all up because your vision was bright
I knew your strength was your wisdom inside
You never let anyone see your heartache
You just got on with it
Anyone tells me that they knew you said you were beautiful
And your words you would stand strong with it
Cause they were like warmth on a winter night
But I was just too young to go on with it
And there somethings I could try to do
But its an impossible task for me to even try to say goodbye to you
I couldnt do that I owe my life to you
And of the pieces of my soul
Because I need a sign I hope this pain will heal in time
You know I never want to be alone
I can see the stars as a cold wind greets the air
And will you think of me up there
Can I say goodbye to you
And paint the stains of the teardrops down my face
Or feel the chill of your warm embrace
Can I say goodbye to you oh
I think you phoney
I was younger with the knowledge of things that I know now
I would be by your side when you needed me
Instead of asking you Nan can I go out
Standing in a road with the gangs that I know now
Everyones missing you loads Jessicas grown up
Warreen Lauren and Alex are fine and Im living with hope
Its been a while since Ive seen C and the mouths
I miss seeing a family being a family
And us agreeing with smiles how it used to be as a child
But as time goes by the bridge seems longer
Family problems have never been funny
In my heart the only one that dissed me was Sonia
She took all our inheritance money
Left the rest of us to pick up the pieces
I never forgive the way she betrayed us
There aint a big enough reason
Before I sell out my fam Ill be giving up breathing
But I guess that everyones different
Or should I say no ones perfect
She had happiness in front of her
But chose to ride the wave that no ones surfing
Since you gone the foundations crumbled
So building it back up is my next step
I got all the bricks and the cement but
Its hard when its done I dont know what to expect
So give me the strength that I need to perform this task
Make it right I must do
And I ask cause I trust you
It goes way beyond a song when I say I love you
And of the pieces of my soul
Because I need a sign I hope this pain will heal in time
You know I never wanna be alone
I can see the stars as a cold the wind greets the air
And will you think of me up there
Can I say goodbye to you
And paint the stains of the teardrops down my face
Or feel the chill of your warm embrace
Can I say goodbye to you oh
Its just for now so I should hush
Ill never get enough Ill see you when I see you but
I miss you
Ohh how I miss you
Its just for now so I should hush
Ill never get enough Ill see you when I see you but
I miss you
Ohh how I miss you
There aint enough words to describe
How sorry I am for the pain that I caused
Sorry for when I stuck up my own blood
We were young and he said it was raping his broad
And for the day police came to the door
Im sorry for being such a bad youth
Stealing from your purse and making you mourn
I never been able to say this before
Cause I was so inconsiderate
You loved me unconditionally
And I took advantage of it like a idiot
Not seeing the pure soul that I was living with
I really hope that you can forgive me
You going away was a punishment
But I wont let go Im holding you with me
But I still fight the emotions within me
I can see the stars as the cold wind greets the air
And will you think of me up there
And can I say goodbye to you
And paint the stains of the teardrops down your face
Feel the chill of your warm embrace
And can I say goodbye to you
I can see the stars as a cold wind greets the air
And will you think of me up there
Can I say goodbye to you
And paint the stains of the teardrops down my face
Or feel the chill of your warm embrace
Can I say goodbye to youAnother day another life
Passes by just like mine
Its not complicated
Another mind
Another soul
Another body to grow old
Its not complicated
Do you ever wonder if the stars shine out for you
Float down
Like autumn leaves
Hush now
Close your eyes before the sleep
And youre miles away
And yesterday you were here with me
Another tear
Another cry
Another place for us to die
Its not complicated
Another love thats gone to waste
Another light lost from your face
Its complicated
Is it that its over or do birds still sing for you
Float down
Like autumn leaves
Hush now
Close your eyes before the sleep
And youre miles away
And yesterday you were here with me
Ooh how I miss you
My symphony played the song that carried you out
Ooh how I miss you
And I I miss you and I wish youd stay
Do you ever wonder if the stars shine out for you
Float down
Like autumn leaves
Hush now
Close your eyes before the sleep
And youre miles away
And yesterday you were here with me
Touch down
Like a seven four seven
Or stay out and well live forever nowSettle down with me
Cover me up
Cuddle me in
Lie down with me
And hold me in your arms
And your hearts against my chest your lips pressed in my neck
Im falling for your eyes but they dont know me yet
And with a feeling Ill forget Im in love now
Kiss me like you wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
This feels like falling in love
Falling in love
Were falling in love
Settle down with me
And Ill be your safety
Youll be my lady
I was made to keep your body warm
But Im cold as the wind blows so hold me in your arms
Oh no
My hearts against your chest your lips pressed in my neck
Im falling for your eyes but they dont know me yet
And with this feeling Ill forget Im in love now
Kiss me like you wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
This feels like falling in love
Falling in love
Were falling in love
Yeah Ive been feeling everything
From hate to love
From love to lust
From lust to truth
I guess thats how I know you
So I hold you close to help you give it up
So kiss me like you wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
This feels like falling in love
Falling in love
Were falling in love
Kiss me like you wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
This feels like falling in love
Falling in love
Were falling in loveThe rain wont stop falling
Its harder than before
This car keeps on stalling
Pedal to the floor
What I need to know
Is if you love me and I
Really need to know
Is if you want me when you call
If you want me when you call
We were young and we were foolish
School books in our arms
Dodging homework dodging classes
To set off fire alarms
And what I need to know
Is if you love me and I
Really need to know
If you need me when you call
If you want me when you call
We are waving our lives away
We are waving our lives away
We are waving our lives away
We are waving our lives away
We are waving and what I need to know
We are waving is if you love me and I
We are waving really need to know
We are waving if you need me when you call
We are waving what I need to know
We are waving is if you love me an I
We are waving really need to know
We are waving if you need me when you call
What I need to know
Is if you love me and I
Really need to know
If you need me when you call
If you want me when you callShock horror im down
Lost youre not around
Theres a lump in my chest that
Sends cold through my head and
My mind shuts sound out
Im on autopilot
And my tongues gone silent
Just switch it off and lay it down
Lay it down next to me
I dont know when I lost my mind
Maybe when I made you mine
Wooooohhh ohhhhh
I dont know when I lost my mind
Maybe it was every time
That you said you said you saaaaaid
That I miss you
That I miss you
These words mean nothing to me
Im just sittin on a fence of how it used to be
These three words are aching
Constrict and suffocating
My mind is racing
With the picture im painting
And my bellys sick to its stomach
When I remember all the times it was with you
When you laid it dowwwn
When you laid down next to me
I dont know when I lost my mind
Maybe when I made you mine
Wooooohhh ohhhhh
I dont know when I lost my mind
Maybe it was every time
That you said you said you saaaaaid
That I miss you more than I let on
I kissed you far too long
Ill let go soon as you do
See I know were not through
I dont know when I lost my mind
maybe when I made you mine
Wooooooah ohhhhhh
I dont know when I lost my mind
Maybe it was every time
That you said you said you saaaaid
That I miss you
That I miss you
Wooooaahhh
I dont know when I lost my mind
Maybe it was every time
That you said you said you saaaaaaid
That I miss youIm gonna pick up the pieces
And build a Lego house
If things go wrong we can knock it down
My three words have two meanings
Theres one thing on my mind
Its all for you
And its dark in a cold December but Ive got you to keep me warm
If youre broken I will mend you and Ill keep you sheltered from the storm thats raging on now
Im out of touch Im out of luck
Ill pick you up when youre getting down
And out of all these things Ive done I think I love you better now
Im out of sight Im out of mind
Ill do it all for you in time
And out of all these things Ive done I think I love you better now
Im gonna paint you by numbers
And color you in
If things go right we can frame it and put you on a wall
And its so hard to say it but Ive been there before
Now Ill surrender up my heart
And swap it for yours
Im out of touch Im out of love
Ill pick you up when youre getting down
And out of all these things Ive done I think I love you better now
Im out of sight Im out of mind
Ill do it all for you in time
And out of all these things Ive done I think I love you better
Dont hold me down
I think my braces are breaking and its more than I can take
And its dark in a cold December but Ive got you to keep me warm
If youre broken I will mend you and Ill keep you sheltered from the storm thats raging on now
Im out of touch Im out of love
Ill pick you up when youre getting down
And out of all these things Ive done I think I love you better now
Im out of sight Im out of mind
Ill do it all for you in time
And out of all these things Ive done I think I love you better now
Im out of touch Im out of luck
Ill pick you up when youre getting down
And out of all these things Ive done I think I love you better now
Im out of sight Im out of mind
Ill do it all for you in time
And out of all these things Ive done I think I love you better now
Im out of touch Im out of luck
Ill pick you up when youre getting down
And out of all these things Ive done I will love you better nowHmm let me go
To see my family
Please Father let me go
As my mother sleeps
I dont know about days gone
But round here nobody lives twice
When your gone your gone without no bye
Cause only a judge can give you life
This is my advice
Trust me I nearly lost my life
three weeks after I got this ride
It seems like I had too much wine
Which that I I didnt get one
Anyway I was going to the booked for a set
Even though I didnt have a set one
Skream hit the decks I was like check one
Put on a show but it werent my best one
Left it dropped off Blacks at his destination
Then I was off to the next one
twenty minutes later I was on the Mone
Tired
But I kept on going
Fell asleep without even knowing
No emotion in my face
No movement in my legs but the car still kept going
Woke up
Lorry
Flash
Panic
Break
Skid
Crash
Skidded
More
Bang
Smash
Out
Cold
Ribs
Cracked
Ouch
I was in so much pain
Crawled out of a Megane that now looked like a Mini
When I was still on the first lane
Baffled didnt even know my name
Fainted too much shock in my brain
Surrounded by paramedics and feds
Trying to get up but fainted again
See I just want you to take a second hear me out
Dont think Im happy cause I smile when you see me out
Ive had serious madnesses where Ive nearly disappeared
Oh Im begging Lord to save me and let me go
To see my family
And keep it inside
Dry eyes while my brother weeps
Save my soul
Please Father let me go
Keep me safe as my mother sleeps
Eyes closed they just wouldnt open
I can hear voices and my phone ringing
Fighting for life cant tell if Im winning
One of the worst situations Ive been in
I can hear all of the angels singing
But when it stopped humming
My brain turned on stared running
Still in pain but it started numbing
The stone cold comeback I made was stunning
I still tried to do a few shows cause I didnt wanna tell them that I werent coming
But I was left with a permanent problem
Nobody knows about the pain that Im in inside
Ever so cunning
six weeks later jogging and running
I used the first aid kit like a drum set
Picked up the tools and I gave it a drumming
Trust me when it comes to mistakes
You cant afford to let one in
Never done dream for a while
The pipeline was blocked
So I learnt and done a bit of plumbing
They say tomorrow never dies
But he forgot to tell you you can
You can have a sicker clan than Wu-Tang
But when your times up thats it its you fam
You can try beg for another
Sometimes Ill be on my way to a show
Thinking I just wanna see my brother
Then do a U-turn Im gone Runner
I just want you to take a second hear me out
Dont think Im happy cause I smile when you see me out
Ive had serious madnesses where Ive nearly disappeared
Oh Im begging Lord to save me and let me go
To see my family
And keep it inside
Dry eyes while my brother weeps
Save my soul
Please Father let me go
Keep me safeYou give me life
Like lots of oxygen
You treat me like
I was in love again
And I hold you tight
Tight enough to know
That you are mine
Id never let you go
And its you I miss
And its you I miss
So let it out
And let it out now
And let it out
And let it out now now
And you speak to me
Behind your dark green stare
And you let me be
As if I wasnt there
It seemed perfect
The concept
Free from any regret
Another couple based on teen sex
You idiot true I was just like you
We couldnt be torn apart
You see we were just like glue
Its you I miss
And its you I miss
So let it out
And let it out now
And let it out
And let it out now now
It seemed perfect
The concept
Free from any regret
Another couple based on teen sex
You idiot true I was just like you
We couldnt be torn part
You see we were just like glue
Were like glue
So let it out
Let it out now
Let it out
And let it out now now
It seemed perfect
The concept

Another couple based on teen sex
You idiot true I was just like you
We couldnt be torn apart
You see we were just like glueYou were just a small bump unborn in four months youre brought to life
You might be left with my hair but youll have your mothers eyes
Ill hold your body in my hands be as gentle as I can
And now your scan on my unmade plans
Small bump in four months youre brought to life
Ill hold you tightly Ill give you nothing but truth
If youre not inside me Ill put my future in you
You are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers round my thumb and hold me tight
Oh you are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers round my thumb and hold me tight
And youll be alright
Youre just a small bump unknown and youll grow into your skin
With a smile like hers and a dimple beneath your chin
Oh Finger nails the size of a half grain of rice
And eyelids closed to be soon opened wide a small bump
In four months youll open your eyes
Ill hold you tightly Ill give you nothing but truth
If youre not inside me Ill put my future in you
You are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers round my thumb and hold me tight
Oh you are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers round my thumb and hold me tight
And youll be alright
You can lie with me with your tiny feet when your half asleep
Ill leave you be
Right in front of me for a couple weeks
So I can keep you safe
Cause you are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers round my thumb and hold me tight
Oh you are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers round my thumb and hold me tight
And youll be alright
You were just a small bump unborn for four months then torn from life
Maybe you were needed up there but were still unaware as whyGive me love like her
Cause lately Ive been waking up alone
Paint splattered teardrops on my shirt
Told you Id let them go
And that Ill fight my corner
Maybe tonight Ill call ya
After my blood turns into alcohol
No I just wanna hold ya
Give a little time to me or burn this out
Well play hide and seek to turn this around

After my blood is drowning in alcohol
No I just wanna hold ya
Give a little time to me or burn this out
Well play hide and seek to turn this around
All I want is the taste that your lips allow

Of all the money that eer I had
Ive spent it in good company
And all the harm that eer Ive done
Alas it was to none but me
And all Ive done for want of width
To memory now I cant recall
So fill to me the parting glass
Good night and joy be with you all
Of all the comrades that ever I had
They are sorry for my going away
And all the sweethearts that ever I had
They would wish me one more day to stay
But since it falls unto my lot
That I should rise and you should not
Ill gently rise and Ill softly call
Good night and joy be with you all
A man may drink and not be drunk
A man may fight and not be slain
A man may court a pretty girl
And perhaps be welcomed back again
But since it has so ought to be
By a time to rise and a time to fall
Come fill to me the parting glass
Good night and joy be with you all
Good night and joy be with you allSmoke alarm went off at night
I woke up wiped the sleep out of my eye
She left a note Ill be back in five
Well Im still waiting for that moment to arrive
Hey
I was told to put my job in front of you
But it wont hold me like you do
But I do it for the love
Waiting on the gold rush
Keep it on the edge
Smoking on a roll up
When I see my friends all they say is hold up
And remember the time
When we were in school listening to grown ups
Didnt learn a thing but then again you know what
You know how to sing
But you dont know anything other than that
So maybe you should learn to love her like like the way
And maybe you should learn to love her like like the way
And maybe you should learn to love her like like the way
And maybe you should learn to love her like like the way
You wanna be loved
I never told her that I liked
The way she dances slightly out of time
And pretends she knows the words to a song shes never heard
But I tell her all the time
Hey
Well I was told to put my job in front of you
But it wont hold me like you do
But I do it for the love waiting on the gold rush
Keep it on the edge smoking on a roll up
When I see my friends all they say is hold up
And remember the time
When we were in school listening to grown ups
Didnt learn a thing but then again you know what
You know how to sing
But you dont know anything other than that
So maybe you should learn to love her like like the way
And maybe you should learn to love her like like the way
But maybe you should learn to love her like like the way
And maybe you should learn to love her like like the way
You wanna be loved hey
I do it for the love waiting on the gold rush
Keep it on the edge smoking on a roll up
When I see my friends all they say is hold up
And remember the time
When we were in school listening to grown ups
Didnt learn a thing but then again you know what
You know how to sing
But you dont know anything other than that
So maybe you should learn to love her like like the way
And maybe you should learn to love her like like the way
And maybe you should learn to love her like like the way
But maybe you should learn to love her like like the way
You wanna be lovedNow Im in town break it down thinking of making a new sound
Playing a different show
every night in front of a new crowd
Thats new now ciao seems that life is great now
See me lose focus as I sing to you loud
And I cant no I wont hush
Ill say the words that make you blush
Im gonna sing this now ow ow
See Im true my songs are where my heart is
Im like glue I stick to other artists
Im not you now that would be disastrous
Let me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures
See Im real I do it all its all me
Im not fake dont ever call me lazy
I wont stay put give me the chance to be free
Suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me
Cause you need me but I dont need you
You need me but I dont need you
You need me but I dont need you at all
You need me but I dont need you
You need me but I dont need you
You need me but I dont need you
You need me but I dont need you at all
You need me
I sing and write my own tune and I write my own verse
Hell dont need another word-smith to make my tune sell
Call yourself a singer-writer youre just bluffing
Your names on the credits and you didnt write nothing
I sing fast I know that all my shits cool
I will blast and I didnt go to Brit School
I came fast with the way I act right
I cant last if Im smoking on a crack pipe
And I wont be a product of my genre
My mind will always be stronger than my songs are
Never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya
Always read the stories that you hear on Wikipedia
And musically Im demonstrating
When I perform live feels like I am meditating
Times at the Enterprise when some fella filmed me
A young singer-writer like a Gabriella Cilmi
Cause you need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you at all
You need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you at all
You need me
Cause with the lyrics Ill be aiming it right
I wont stop till my names in lights
At stadium heights with Damien Rice
On red carpets now Im on Arabian Nights
Because Im young and all my brothers gonna give me advice
Long nighter short height and I gone hyper
Never be anything but a singer-songwriter
The games over but now Im on a new level
Watch how I step on the track without a loop pedal
People think that Im bound to blow up
Ive done around about a thousand shows
But I havent got a house plus I live on the couch
So you can be the lyrics when Im singing them out
Wow
From day one Ive been prepared
With vofive wax for my ginger hair
So now Im back to the sofa giving a dose of what the future holds
Cause its another day
Plus Ill keep my last name forever keep the genre pretty basic
Gonna be breaking into other peoples tunes when I chase it
And replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift
Into another rappers shoes using new laces
Selling CDs from my rucksack aiming for the papers
Selling CDs from my rucksack aiming for the majors
Nationwide tour with just jack still had to get the bus back
Clean cut kid without a razor for the mustache
I hit back when the pen hurts me
Im still a choir boy in a Fenchurch tee
Im still the same as a year ago
But more people hear me though
According to the MySpace and YouTube videos
Im always doing shows if Im not Im in the studio
Truly broke never growing up call me Ruffio
Melody music maker
Reading all the papers
They say Im up and coming like Im fucking in an elevator
Cause you need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you at all
You need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you at all
You need me man I dont need youThese thoughts I have could be clear ones and they can seem vivid
the goals I reach are not near ones the further than limits
I block her out so when Im looking through my mind she aint in it
Can I be free for a minute can I be me for a minute
The thoughts I have can be dark ones even be smart ones
Know Im gonna have a couple straight from the heart ones
Tell you what I think I will until I depart mum
Its you that I lived for I am the first and the last one to love you lots
Whats better than thinking about the ones you love
Nothing much when youre thinking about the ones you love
I feel the same when Im in the floor see the sun above
Unconditional like bills paid when I run them up
No one here to help you pain now youre gonna moan
No one here to save the day now youre all alone
Wish I was born with a golden spoon in my mouth
Fact is I wasnt so Im coming from a colder zone
And when the sun falls down Ill be up again
I never close my eyes
And if the dawn might break Ill see nothing when nothing when
My thoughts are only you and my mind is over you
My thoughts are over you and these words are all for you all for you
I wanna see you happy I wanna see you smile
Cause youre been trespassing and you wont leave my mind
Now even think about this call me say yes nan
Im thirty-one now Im still saying yes nan
You had to replace my mom dad two parents in one
I know your proud staring at your grandson
I found a job I like like got the flat the cars the bike the quad I
like
Because of you Im tireless in every single song I write
Had a golden life wanting people to honour mine
Tell em while Im here cause one day Im gonna die
And when Im Im gone I want my music still playin
And when my people listen to this track its gonna make them wanna cry
I aint gonna lie I think about my scene to say the games better is a must
now I gotta fly
My talents gonna shine for surely fam I know it I work round the clock
I dont stop at nightThis city never sleeps
I hear the people walk by when its late
Sirens bleed through my windowsill
I cant close my eyes
Cant control what Im into
This tower is alive
The lights that blind keep me awake
With my hood up and lace untied
Sleep fills my mind
Cant control what Im into
London calls me a stranger
A traveler
This is now my home my home
Im burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
Im blazing on the street
What I do isnt up to you
And if the city never sleeps
Then that makes two
The pavement is my friend
And it will take me where I need to go
I find it trips me up
And puts me down
This is not what Im used to
The shop across the road
Fulfills my needs and gives me company
When I need it
Voices speak through my walls
I dont think Im gonna make it
Past tomorrow
London calls me a stranger
A traveler
This is now my home my home
Im burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
Im blazing on the street
What I do isnt up to you
And if the city never sleeps
Then that makes two
And my lungs hurt
And my ears bled
With the sound of the city life
Echoed in my head
Do I need this to keep me alive
The traffic stops and starts
But I need to move along
London calls me a stranger
This is not my home home
Im burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
Im blazing on the street
What I do isnt up to you
And if the city never sleeps
Then that makes twoThey tell me you can only dream when you fell asleep
But now Im working to achieve but sleep is the only thing I never see
And I vowed that my breathing with never cease
To the retrieve then I cant let them be
I wont let em leave and I had the same feeling since seventeen
But I wasnt ready then like a lemon screen
Now Im in the magazines almost every week
Cause Im getting heat like in Tenerife
Right now its better than its never been
Never fade like a plant thats evergreen
So I hope to my heart but my self doubts are getting me
Afraid for my cross getting dump for the day and Im getting weak
Cause Im new Im that boy that starts it
They chase dreams together like a slumber party
And now Im on my own even though Im smooth sailing
Im scared to sing cause my nightmare is fading
Chorus
When the darkness creeps in
I feel my nightmares watching me
And when my dreams are sleeping
I feel my nightmares watching me
Oh oh oh
I feel my nightmares watching me
You better wake up cause I am making moves
And even when Im dozing Im breaking rooms
Im only hitting the sack when Im training
Too busy trying to keep up with the latest snooze
Made my bed and thats where Im heading
I fly straight with the best man I embed em
Married to the game was a quiet wedding then I had to fight to get her
Now Im taking control of my inception
cause they try to hit misses with my direction
See they better marry donna cause when I strike strike
Not even Maradonna is gonna cry Im awake at night
The haters know where the family lives
Tell me what I catch but youre playing knock door ginger
Just gonna lose a lot more than I need it
They say sleep is the cause of death
But I hear shit because I am deaf
Gang signs Im NA reading
Im a CEO man you suckers are next
Chorus
When the darkness creeps in
I feel my nightmares watching me
And when my dreams are sleeping
I feel my nightmares watching me
Oh oh oh
I feel my nightmares watching me
They watching me They watch me sleep
Let me go
I fell asleep on sofa walk up in reality
And daydream about losing my sanity
Ive been rhyming forever got a blind flow
So I can see an off note with my eyes closed
But to achieve the dreams you cant doze off cos your dream a sleep
I aint nodding off but Im nodding to the beat
I be shocking in my sheets when I should have been asleep
See all the dreams Im fonder
You placed me in the team insomnia
Now I Mr hard worker
In my nightmares I Mr cant turn up
And I missed my chance worst luck
Trying to hit women I Mr I turn up
Yeah and I walked from ish
thinking it will put me to rest on my mattress
Chorus
When the darkness creeps in
I feel my nightmares watching me
And when my dreams are sleeping
I feel my nightmares watching me
Oh oh oh
I feel my nightmares watching me
Watching meMy mind is a warrior
My heart is a foreigner
My eyes are the color of red like the sunset
Ill never keep it bottled up
Left to the hands of the coroner
Be a true heart not a follower
Were not done yet now
I see it in your movements tonight
If we can ever do this right
Im never gonna let you down
Oh Ill never let you down
Now keep it on the down low
And Ill keep you around so Ill know
That Ill never let you down
Ill never let you down
Youre strumming on my heart strings
Like you were a grade eight but I never felt this way
Ill pick your feet up off of the ground
And never ever let you down
Youre strumming on my heart strings
Like you were a grade eight but I never felt this way
Ill pick your feet up off of the ground
And never ever let you down
My eyes are a river filler
This drink is a liver killer
My chest is a pillow for my weary head to lay to rest again
Your body is my ballpoint pen
And your mind is my new best friend
Your eyes are my mirror to take me to the edge again
Now I see it in your movements tonight
If we should ever do this right
Im never gonna let you down
Oh Ill never let you down
Well keep it on the down low
And Ill keep you around so Ill know
That Ill never let you down
Ill never let you down
Youre strumming on my heart strings
Like you were a grade eight but I never felt this way
Ill pick your feet up off of the ground
And never ever let you down
Youre strumming on my heart strings
Like you were a grade eight but I never felt this way
Ill pick your feet up off of the ground
And never ever let you down
Hold my heart to stop me bleeding now now now
And Ill never let you down
Hold my heart to stop me bleeding now now now
And Ill never let you down
Hold my heart to stop me bleeding now now now
And Ill never let you down
Hold my heart to stop me bleeding now now now
And Ill never let you down
Youre strumming on my heart strings
Like you were a grade eight but I never felt this way
Ill pick your feet up off of the ground
And never ever let you down
Youre strumming on my heart strings
Like you were a grade eight but I never felt this way
Ill pick your feet up off of the ground
And never ever let you downHi my name is JME there was a time when radio played me
Cause my music came from my heart it was real to me
But now its a par
Im here struggling keeping it real
While the rest of them are hustling seeking a deal
Sometimes I sit back and think JME just do one tune make a couple Gs and chill
The reason I started making music is the exact same reason that Ill never do it I swear
I didnt go through all that for this
Ill give that a miss thats just how it is unfair straight
Who could tell me different look at me determined
Man on a mission my music is me and I am my music
So like it or lump it Im a do this
I never had a playlist in my heart oho
Now I need an A list just to chart oho
But Ive been famous from the start oho
How am I gonna make my mark oho oh
Are you gonna play me though
This song was never meant for the radio
I get in forget the radio spin Im just doing my thing
And I dont have time for a playlist
How much will you pay me though
The song was not a hit on the radio
Oho oho oho oh oh oh
Thank God for night clubs and the raves
Cause I dont think they like us on the airwaves
Unless we water it down but cordial music is boring me now
I swear I guess it matters what your goal is
Or in this music scene what your role is
Im still trying here cause Im a pioneer
I use my mouth less than I use my eyes and ears
See Im just telling you the truth
Cant shoot the messenger bullet proof booth
You wont hear me on the radio
But go to the rave and the crowd theyre raising roof
Why is that Whats going on there
To tell you the truth I dont really care
I am my music my music is me
Like it or not this is how its gonna be
I never had a playlist in my heart oho
Now I need an A list just to chart oho
But Ive been famous from the start oho
How am I gonna make my mark oho
Are you gonna play me though
This song was never meant for the radio
I get in forget the radio spin Im just doing my thing
And I dont have time for a playlist
How much will you pay me though
The song was not a hit on the radio
Oho oho oho oh oho ohHush little baby dont you cry
I said hush little baby dont you cry
I said hush little baby dont you cry no
I said hush little baby dont you cry
Im saying hush little baby dont you cry
Daddy aint sure if he can raise you right
I aint even good with saving my money
Why should I think I can save your life
And the whole familys gonna think Im a devil I dont wanna see my angels eyes
I say this with one hand on my heart guilt aint gonna make me change my mind
My first thoughts were the worst thoughts running round my head in circles
The worlds gonna hate me for saying this but patience is a virtue
So we dont have to rush for our first youth we can take time do rehearsals
And I aint acting this is personal and I aint doing this just to hurt you
I should say goodbye before I say hello
So darling hold me closely tonight
Because if you open your eyes Ill never let you go
Moving slowly well both sleep tonight
And well just be dreaming til you wake me up
When Im telling her about raving
Shes telling me about cravings
I want her to just get the message
I dont wanna have to be so blatant
So I told her my life aint balanced
Yeah said the time aint right
She said gods clocks the only one that matters
And its about time I tried yeah and if I listen to my family
Then theyll be a new addition to my family
I cant help feeling peer pressured everybodys looking down but they dont understand me
And everyones so suggestive Im getting mixed messages but nobodys rang me
Huh Im saying this aint a game but I say the wrong thing and everyone wants to hang me
I should say goodbye before I say hello
So darling hold me closely tonight
Because if you open your eyes Ill never let you go
Moving slowly well both sleep tonight
And well just be dreaming til you wake me up
Hush little baby dont you cry
I said hush little baby dont you cry
I said hush little baby dont you cry no
I said hush little baby dont you cry
I know I should say goodbye before I say hello
Darling hold me closely tonight
Because if you open your eyes Ill never let you go
Moving slowly well both sleep tonight
And well just be dreaming til you wake me upThis is the start of something beautiful
This is the start of something new
You are the one whod make me lose it all
You are the start of something new ooh
And Ill throw it all away
And watch you fall into my arms again
And Ill throw it all away
Watch you fall now
You are the earth that I will stand upon
You are the words that I will sing
And Ive thrown it all away
And watched you fall into his arms again
And I thrown it all away
Watched you fall now
And take me back
Take me home
Watch me fall
Down to earth
Take me back for
This is the start of something beautiful
You are the start of something newYoure not her
Though I try to see you differently
I tow the line
You see Im searching for what used to be mine
I saw your eyes
And then I saw her staring back at me
And I will try to find another one
Who suited me as well as her
I moved far away from you
And I want to see you here beside me dear
But things arent clear
When we never even tried
We never even talked
We never even thought in the long run
Whenever it was painful
Whenever I was away
Id miss you
I miss you
She was mine
I was hers
And all thats in between
If she would cry
I would shelter her
And keep her from the darkness that will be
If I moved far away from you
And I want to see you here beside me dear
But things arent clear
We never even tried
We never even talked
We never even thought in the long run
Whenever it was painful
Whenever I was away
Id miss you
And I miss you
Dont drop me in
Its not my turn
If you cut deep
Then I might learn
You scarred and left me
Like a sunburn
Dont drop me in
Its not my turn
If you cut deep
Then I might learn
You scar and leave me
Like a sunburn
We never even tried
We never even talked
We never even thought in the long run
Whenever it was painful
Whenever I was away
Id miss you
And I miss youI paid all my dues
And she wanted to know
That Id never leave her
Now Im ready to go
And strange as it seems
Shes endless to me
Shes just like paperwork
But harder to read
Patience my enemy
And lovings my friend
Its harder to leave
With my heart on my sleeve
Than to stay and just pretend
Oh she knows me so well
Oh she knows me like I know myself
I made all my plans
And she has made hers
She kept me in mind
But I wasnt sure
I searched every room
For a way to escape
But every time
I tried to leave
She keeps holding on to me
For dear life
And blocking my way
Patience my enemy
And lovings my friend
Its harder to leave
With my heart on my sleeve
Than to stay and just pretend
Oh she knows me so well
Oh she knows me like I know myselfI seem to find myself talking to the powers that be
Awaking the shade and shadowed under towering trees
Admiring the scene inhaling fumes of flowers that breathe
Jet-lagged eyes are begging for an hour to sleep
Although my blood shot whites and irises they never find any
Clock stops at times where the sunshine can blind many
Although my eyes are heavy they wont be closing soon
Cause I heard that time waits for nobody I suppose its true
We make corrosive tunes through acid tabs and vocables
To see the flashing lights at photo shoots we make our motive moves
I say whatever I feel to vent a rhyme
So I can still invent the lines and stay close to the friends of mine
Cause real will recognize real is what my father says
And Ill be sticking to this phrase until I pass away
Overworking no sleep is just another way to die slow
But Ill just keep going strong and never let my eyes close
Five oclock with lights off
Interview with a vampire
Sleep is for the living and not a utensil that I require
I swear I said that Ill sleep when Im dead
Whos on the beat upon the feature with Ed its D-E-V to the Z
Overtired pale-faced like Michael Myers
Bags underneath my eyes can show the baggage Ive acquired
And over the time within this maze Ill think youll find youll never find that piece of mind you seek to find until your dying
Cause I got too much to stay awake for to sleep or even take four seconds out the game
Its time to wage war
Scissors grab a sword and sharpen up your hunting knives
two psychopathic lyricists are driving on the hunt tonight
Im haling from the Essex and the East London boarder line
Villains never sleep the mastermind in all sorts of crimes
Be wide awake just like your snorting lines
Or get left mortified like youve just seen the ghost of Jesus walking by
Chorus
I never sleep
When trouble steals thoughts from my restless mind for free it could be
The times Im living in I never sleep when trouble steals thoughts from my restless Mind for free it could be
The times Im living in lately
I brush my teeth every night but still I wake up with a bad mouth
And the background is my past and my presence will bring it back out
Deliver the raps how I flow
I live with the raps now and those that hate me call me Ron
But they wont Slytherin too easy believe me Im Snape minded
Be within this great time be on minimum wage life is a prison escape that Im in
Its all to do with timing not the label that you sign with
Then my mates are doing fine but then they never put the time in
I try to hide my cold side like when I flip my pillows
Some of the the songs I write are real because the chart is filled with si-lo-con
Im still broke without the money for a Mac Pro living out of three bags no talk About my cash flow
Opposite of sober cause I never did my homework
Which has got me on the sofa no degree but growing older
I played a fool to catch the wise I will never tell a lie
Await death take deep breaths try to never die
Never die
Two guys with the same view keep it tight like screws
Making metaphors flow and move like typhoons and tunes
And if we got our eyes on you well catch you while you snooze
Times elapsing while your catching Zs the masses like to move
We scan the situation analyse information and then decide what probably is most Practical to do
Driven young gentlemen
Ive hardly changed my bed sheets at all over the last twelve months causeI havent Slept in them true
Im coming home the lights are on your rights are wrong so Im correcting em
We got the fans all like Oh wow its Devs and Ed what less did you bloody expect From em
In the end sleep deprivation might just be our detriment
Fighting through writers block from nine oclock to five oclock and no way will I ever Waste a second of the time I got
I keep my pupils engaged
Like a classroom in holy matrimony but Im only trying to stay awake
Chorus
I never sleep
When trouble steals thoughts from my restless mind for free it could be
The times Im living in I never sleep when trouble steals thoughts from my restless Mind for free it could be 
The times Im living in latelyI should ink my skin
With your name
And take my passport out again
And just replace it
See I could do without a tan
On my left hand where my fourth finger meets my knuckle
And I should run you a hot bath
And fill it up with bubbles
Cause maybe youre lovable
And maybe youre my snowflake
And your eyes turn from green to gray and in the winter Ill
Hold you in a cold place
And you should never cut your hair
Cause I love the way you flick it off your shoulder
And you will never know just how beautiful you are to me
But maybe Im just in love when you wake me up
And would you ever feel guilty
If you did the same to me
Would you make me a cup of tea
To open my eyes in the right way
And I know you love Shrek
Cause weve watched it twelve times
But maybe youre hoping for a fairy tale too
And if your DVD breaks today
You shoulda got a VCR
Cause I never owned a Blu-Ray
True say
And now Ive always been s at computer games and your brother always beats me
And if I lost I go all cross
And chuck all the controllers at the TV
And then youd laugh at me
And be asking me
If Im gonna be home next week
And then youd lie with me till I fall asleep
And flutter eyelash on my cheek between the sheets
And you will never know just how beautiful you are to me
But maybe Im just in love when you wake me up
I think you hate the smell of smoke
You always tryna get me to stop
But you drink as much as me
And I get drunk a lot
So Ill take you to the beach
And walk along the sand And Ill
Make you a heart pendant
With a pebble held in my hand
And Ill carve it like a necklace
So the heart falls where your chest is
And now a piece of me is a piece of the beach and it falls just where it needs to be
And rests peacefully
So you just need to breathe
To feel my heart against yours now
Against yours now
Cause maybe Im just in love when you wake me up
Or maybe Im just in love when you wake me up
Maybe I fell in love when you woke me upIf we take this bird in with its broken leg
We can nurse it she said
Come inside for a little lie down with me
And if you fall asleep it wouldnt be the worse thing
But when I wake up and your make up is on my shoulder
And tell me if I lie down would you stay now
And let me hold you oh
But if I kiss you will your mouth read this truth
Darling how I miss you strawberries taste how lips do
And its not complete yet mustnt get our feet wet
Cause that leads to regret diving in too soon
And Ill owe it all to you oh my little bird
My little bird
If we take a walk out in the morning dew
We can lie down so Im next to you
Come inside for a little home made tea
And if you fall asleep at least youre next to me
And if I wake up say its late love go back to sleep
Im covered by nature and Im safe now
Underneath this oak tree with you beside me
But if I kiss you will your mouth read this truth
Darling how I miss you strawberries taste how lips do
And its not complete yet mustnt get our feet wet
Cause that leads to regret diving in too soon
And Ill owe it all to you oh my little bird
My little bird
My little bird
My little bird
And of all these things Im sure of Im not quite certain of your love
You make me scream then I made you cry
When I left that little bird with its broken leg to die
But if I kiss you will your mouth read this truth
Darling how I miss you strawberries taste how lips do
And its not complete yet mustnt get our feet wet
Cause that leads to regret diving in too soon
But Ill owe it all to you oh my little bird
My little bird whoa oh oh oh whoa
My little bird
My little bird
Youre my little birdIn hotel rooms far away from home
I miss you more than you will know
Shine a light
Just one side
To think again
That your mine
Its high time
Im far away from home
Tell me that theres no where left to land
and Ill fall down
Catch me with the strength of your own hands
and Ill fall down
Oh I need you without you Ill fall apart
and last winter I need you to feed my heart
But all the night
Sky blue
Stars are bright
Shine through
Like you
And Im far away from home
Tell me that theres no where left to land
and Ill fall down
Catch me with the strength of your own hands
and Ill fall down
Tell me that theres no where left to land
and Ill fall down
Catch me with the strength of your own hands
and Ill fall downShes like cold coffee in the morning
Im drunk off last nights whisky and coke
Shell make me shiver without warning
And make me laugh as if Im in on the joke
And you can stay with me forever
Or you could stay with me for now
Tell me if Im wrong
Tell me if Im right
Tell me if you need a loving hand
To help you fall asleep tonight
Tell me if I know
Tell me if I do
Tell me how to fall in love the way you want me to
Ill wake with coffee in the morning
But she prefers two lumps of sugar and tea
Outside the day is up and calling
But I dont have to be so please go back to sleep
Stay with me forever
Or you could stay with me for now
Tell me if Im wrong
Tell me if Im right
Tell me if you need a loving hand
To help you fall asleep tonight
Tell me if I know
Tell me if I do
Tell me how to fall in love the way you want me to
Cause I love the way you wake me up
For goodness sake will my love not be enough
Tell me if Im wrong
Tell me if Im right
Tell me if you need a loving hand
To help you fall asleep tonight
Tell me if I know
Tell me if I do
Tell me how to fall in love the way you want me to
Tell me if Im wrong
Tell me if Im right
Tell me if you need a loving hand
To help you fall asleep tonightIm in so deep Omar Epps can relate to my situation on a real
Pain aint the emotion I wanna feel but Im thriving off it so its only right I like this topic
Ill be on a hill keeping my head above water
I cant afford to ever get caught in a corner
So I move with the force of a sorcerer
Its dark when Im about just me myself and my shadow
Im parro running out of ammo and it seems like everyone around me is on the same path so its narrow
The less then the better a more proof for the last one left so they dont leave me as wet as an umbrella
I play fool to catch wise are they ever gonna guess Im clever
How can I be at my best with this pressure
I got a lot to loose but when I watch the news my minds infected with terror
No wonder Im under stress I got my door kicked off by a bunch of feds
And when they left It looked like I had rave and invited more than a hundred guests
I should of bust the back door and jump the fence
It easy when you look back shoulda woulda coulda but I bet you cant bring should woulda could back
Back to fifteen I said to myself that Im more than a hood track
Ooh you can drag me in the deep ends
Ooh but you will never drown me out
Ooh you can drag me in the deep ends
Ooh but you will never drown me out out out
You wont drown me out out out
You wont drown me out
You cant ever drown me out the water supplies too low
And Im around about sixty-one ten stone
Ive never seen someone drown without a sufficient amount of liquid in their lungs
A violent MC my mouth can vouch
Do I sound like Im choking Seriously do I sound like Im joking
Im floating even though that they wanna send me to the bottom of the ocean
But I am a ship thats sunk many years Im maintaining
Plain sailing no commotion
Like a dolphin when its in motion
But i cant break me so why would I show them Im broken
No real shit throw my skin aint close to corrosion
Fuck em all this aint tug of war still dont get roped in the open I dont wanna reveal my violent side
But I swear that I will soon if the Lord above dont provide a sign
Then Ima kill you arm for arm eye for eye
Nah I just wanna live my life but you dont wanna see this guy survive
Ooh you can drag me in the deep ends
Ooh but you will never drown me out
Ooh you can drag me in the deep ends
Ooh but you will never drown me out out out
You wont drown me out
You wont drown me outLying in a bedroom
Lighting up a Benson
Face hair is growing
So I cut with a vengeance
Hey did I mention
As she makes an entrance
Said I had a tendency
To finish off a sentence
Oh well shes a local girl
No make-up
Cos she knows me well
Hair tied up in elastic band
With a kiss on the cheek
For her one-night man
Is it fast food
Ill regret it after
And I needed money
But Im too shy to ask her
So she buys me chips and cheese
And I tell her I love her
And shes all I need
I take it with a cold glass
Of the fruit and the barley
Shes still a sucker for the
Apple and Bacardi
Heading to the party
Sitting in the car seat
BEP on radio
It makes me feel naughty
She knows me well
Bit of a catch
To have a local girl
Hair tied up in elastic band
With a kiss on the cheek
For her one-night man
I dont wanna go alone
I dont wanna go alone
I dont wanna go alone
Tell her that I love her
Tell her that I need her
Tell her that shes more
Than a one-night stand
Tell her that she turns my cheeks
The colour of my hair
All I wanna do is be near
Tell her that I want her
Tell her that I need her
Tell her that shes more than a one-night stand
Tell her that I love her
More than anyone else
If you dont then Ill tell her myself
And weve got love in us
So if the drink kill us
Were gonna dance all night
Till the floor fillers
If we talk outside
I say I hate wasps too
I dont really dance
So Ill just watch you
Are you taking me back tonight
Tell me if thats alright
I dont wanna be here
Im not the sofa type
Tell me if you have a toothbrush
You dont mind sharing
She said I wanna take off
What youre wearing
I dont wanna go alone
I dont wanna go alone
I dont wanna go alone
Tell her that I love her
Tell her that I need her
Tell her that shes more
Than a one-night stand
Tell her that she turns my cheeks
The colour of my hair
All I wanna do is be near
Tell her that I want her
Tell her that I need her
Tell her that shes more
Than a one-night stand
Tell her that I love her
More than anyone else
If you dont Ill tell her myself
Shes like the fast food
Ill regret it after
And I needed money
But Im too shy to ask her
But she buys me chips and cheese
So I tell her that shes all I need
Tell her that shes more
Than a one-night stand
Tell her that she turns my cheeks
The colour of my hair
All I wanna do is be near
Tell her that shes more
Than a one-night stand
Tell her that I love her
More than anyone else
If you dont Ill tell her myself
Tell her that I love her
Tell her that I need her
That shes more
Than a one-night stand
Tell her that she turns my cheeks
The colour of my hair
All I wanna do is be near
Tell her that I want her
Tell her that I need her
Tell her that shes more
Than a one-night stand
Tell her that I love her
More than anyone else
If you dont Ill tell her myselfWhite lips pale face
Breathing in snowflakes
Burnt lungs sour taste
Lights gone days end
Struggling to pay rent
Long nights strange men
And they say
Shes in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since eighteen
But lately her face seems
Slowly sinking wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us
Cause were just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
And she dont want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
And sells love to another man
Its too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly
Ripped gloves rain coat
Tried to swim and stay afloat
Dry house wet clothes
Loose change bank notes
Weary-eyed dry throat
Call girl no phone
And they say
Shes in the class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since eighteen
But lately
her face seems
Slowly sinking wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us
Cause were just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
And she dont want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
And sells love to another man
Its too cold outside
For angels to fly
An angel will die
Covered in white
Closed eyed
And hoping for a better life
This time well fade out tonight
Straight down the line
And they say
Shes in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since eighteen
But lately her face seems
Slowly sinking wasting
Crumbling like pastries
They scream
The worst things in life come to free us
And were all under the upper hand
Go mad for a couple grams
And we dont want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe we fly to the Motherland
And sell love to another man
Its too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly
To fly fly
For angels to fly to fly to fly
Or angels to dieone thousand, seven hundred and thirty-eight

one thousand, seven hundred and thirty-eight
one thousand, seven hundred and thirty-eight
Got a sack for us to roll
one thousand, seven hundred and thirty-eightIm not a rapper Im a singer with a flow
Ive got a habit for spitting quicker lyrics you know
Youll find me ripping the written out of the pages they sit in
I never want to get bitten
Cause plagiarism is hidden
Watch how I sit on the rhythm
Prisoner with a vision
Signs of a label
But didnt listen to any criticism
Thought you knew but you didnt
So perk your ears up and listen
Studio is a system
And you could say that Im driven
And now its onto the next saga
We drink the best lager
Ill never try to win you over like your stepfather
I do my own thing now
And get respect after
And Im avoiding the caine
Like it was Get Carter
For four years I never had a place to stay
But its safe to say that it kept me grounded
Like a paper weight
At sixteen years old yeah I moved out of my home
I was Macy Gray I tried to say goodbye and I choked
Went from sleeping at a subway station
To sleeping with a movie star
And adding to the population
Not my imagination
I dont wanna relax
Would it hurt your reputation if I put it on wax
I take it back now
Mmmm come on and take it back love
Come on and take it back for us
Dont you fade into the back love
No
I take it back with the rhythm and blues
With my rap pack Ill be singing the news
Tryin act like Jack Black
When I bring it to school
I make a beat with my feet
By just hittin the loop
Bringing the lyrics to prove
That I can fit in these shoes
I give you the truth through the vocal booth
And stars burst out on the scene
Like an opal fruit
They try to take aim like Beckham when he goes to shoot
But then again thats what theyre supposed to do
And Im supposed to be calm
I tattooed the lyrics onto my arm
Whispering everything that happens
Is from now on
Ill be ready to start again
By the end of the song
Since they are claiming I handled it wrong
But then Ive never had an enemy
Except the NME but Ill be selling
Twice as many copies as their magazine will ever be
With only spectacles ahead of me
And festival fees are healthier than a Dalmatian on pedigree
Singing for the masses rubber dingied rapids
I keep this rapping a habit and keep on fashioning magic
Im battling for respect and I dont know if I have it
This songs from the heart cover the planet
I take it back now
Mmmm come on and take it back love
Come on and take it back for us
Dont you fade into the back love
No
And take it back now
Now I dont ever wanna be perfect
Cause Im a singer that you never wanna see shirtless
And I accept the fact that someones got to win worst dressed
Taken my first steps into the scene giving me focus
Putting on a brave face like Timothy Dalton
Considering a name change thinking it was hopeless
Rhyming over recordings avoiding tradition
Cause every days some lyrics and a melody can be written
Now absence can make your heart ache
But drinking absinth can change your mind state
Vividly need to let my liver be
And Ill say it again living life on the edge with a close handful of friends
Is good advice from the man that took his life on the road with me
And I hope to see him blowing up globally
Cause that how its supposed to be
Im screaming out vocally
It might seem totally impossible achieving lifes dreams
But but I just write schemes
Im never having a stylist giving me tight jeans
Madison Square Garden is where I might be
But more likely you find me in the back room of a dive bar with my mates having a pint of Mcdaid discussing records we made and every single second knowing that well never betray the way we were raised remembering our background sat down thats how we plan it out
Its time to take it back now
Mmmm come on and take it back love
Come on and take it back for us
Dont you fade into the back love
No
Mmm come on and take it back love
Come on and take it back for us
Dont you fade into the back love
No
Album version stops here
My dreams keep me awake at night
Written in rhymes til I deliver the hype
Am I just living the lie
With this you must know that the numbers just sold whoa
Will keep me going through the tough times dream with me
We forget ninety per cent of it when we wake
But the other ten per cent it never fades
Dreaming dreams day to day goals
Stay awake loads try to make the cut like the
Paper or razor blade oh never give up
And just remember just to hold out more
A couple years ago
I couldnt just control that thought
Youd find me buskin on the street
When it was cold outdoors
And now Im sweating on the stage of a sold out tour
Writing love songs for the sake of it
Never to make a hit
You cant fake talent and work ethic just to make it quick
Im not a rapper Im a singer I just take the piss and
Most of these other guys are kids that Pulses
Little sister has to babysit thats just the way it is
Dreams you own just set your goals
And have the utmost faith in it tread your own path
Youll never make it as a follower youll never know
Where you will go or where you will be tomorrow rha
by Mees_thirteen in ig and twLoving can hurt loving can hurt sometimes
But its the only thing that I know
When it gets hard you know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive
We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts are never broken
And times forever frozen still
So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me closer til our eyes meet
You wont ever be alone wait for me to come home
Loving can heal loving can mend your soul
And its the only thing that I know know
I swear it will get easier
Remember that with every piece of you
Hm and its the only thing we take with us when we die
Hm we keep this love in this photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts were never broken
And times forever frozen still
So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me closer til our eyes meet
You wont ever be alone
And if you hurt me
Thats okay baby only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I wont ever let you go
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
You can fit me
Inside the necklace you got when you were sixteen
Next to your heartbeat where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul
And if you hurt me
Well thats okay baby only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I wont ever let you go
When Im away I will remember how you kissed me
Under the lamppost back on Sixth street
Hearing you whisper through the phone
Wait for me to come homeWhen your legs dont work like they used to before
And I cant sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks
And darling I will be loving you til were seventy
And baby my heart could still fall as hard at twenty-three
And Im thinking bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Oh me I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am
So honey now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
Im thinking out loud
Maybe we found love right where we are
When my hairs all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds dont remember my name
When my hands dont play the strings the same way mm
I know you will still love me the same
Cause honey your soul can never grow old its evergreen
Baby your smiles forever in my mind and memory
Im thinking bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe its all part of a plan
Ill just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that youll understand
But baby now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
Im thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are oh
Ah la la la la la la la la la la la la

And youre still in my bed
Its kinda rough cause since I met ya
Theres things weve never said
So if I go for a little while longer
When Im home we can talk about the pitfalls of the road
If you say go
I would stop everything oh
My heart would play the role now
And act like its never been broke
Though my soul
Oh oh oh
Lately I really need to know
How long how long can we be touch-and-go
Oh my soul oh oh oh
How long how long can we be touch-and-go
Its not enough to say I want ya

Burning fires in this room
It just fits light and smooth
Like my feet in my shoes
Little one lie with me
Sew you heart to my sleeve
Well stay quiet underneath
Shooting stars if it helps you sleep
And hold me tight dont let me breathe
Feeling like you wont believe
Theres a firefly loose tonight
Better catch it before it burns this place down
And I lie if I dont feel so right
But the world looks better through your eyes
Theres a firefly loose tonight
Better catch it before it burns this place down
And I lie if I dont feel so right
But the world looks better through your eyes
Teach my skin those new tricks
Warm me up with your lips

Close your eyes lean on me
Face to mouth lips to cheek
Feeling numb in my feet
Youre the one
To help me get to sleep

Feeling like you wont believe
Theres a firefly loose tonight
Better catch it before it burns this place down

I woke up early looking out my window
At the Amsterdam sky
Oh baby I was high last night
Cafe clouds and red lights
When I gotcha in mind
You slowed down time
Oh baby I was out of my mind
Sing a song cover and hold me tight
I drill you deep into my chest
Thats where it feels the best
You can remove all the scars
Stop them from breaking my heart
Been on a hurting spree
That brought out the worst in me
cause I dont want to be alone
cause everyday that Im breathing I think you are the one
I love the way that your sweet words just roll off of my tongue
Feel the flame of your wisdom and fill up my lungs
Sweet Mary Jane wont you sing another song
CafÃ clouds and shooting stars are floating across the sky
Oh baby what a beautiful sight
But were only satellites
Oh di ba di ba oh la lights
Oh baby I am so damn high
Have you seen my eyes
With the beat beat of my heart
You take me back to the start
Where everything began
Holding you inside my hands
Between my fingers and thumb
I seal you in with my tongue
Cause I dont want to be alone
Cause everyday that Im breathing I think you are the one
I love the way that your sweet words just roll off of my tongue
Feel the flame of your wisdom and fill up my lungs
Sweet Mary Jane wont you me sing another song
Na na na na na Sweet Mary Jane

Oooh Oooh Oooh Oooh Oooooh
Yo hot damn Doc a Jam like a Summer Show
I keep my car looking like a crash dummy drove
My gear look like the bank got my money froze
For dead presidents I pimp like Huddy roll
Doc the one that excite ya divas ow
If the media shine Im shining with both of the sleeves up
Yo Christina what better hop in here
My block live and in color like Rodman hair han
The club is packed the bar is filled
Im waiting for sister to act like Lauryn Hill
Frankly its a rap no bargain deals
I drive a four wheel ride with foreign wheels
Throw it up baby its Brick City I heard of that
We blessed and hung low like Bernie Mac Bernie Mac
Dogs let em out women let em in
Its like Im ODB the way Im gonna get
Rowdy
Gonna get a little unruly
Get it fired up in a hurry
Wanna get dirrty
Its about time that I came to start the party
Sweat dripping over my body
Dancing getting just a little naughty
Wanna get dirrty its about time for my arrival
Rowdy
Gonna get a little unruly
Get it fired up in a hurry
Wanna get dirrty
Its about time that I came to start the party
Sweat dripping over my body
Dancing getting just a little naughty
Wanna get dirrty its about time for my arrival
WhatShes reinventing loving me
When were resembling cutlery on the sofa
It must have been about five hundred and one
Like my blue ripped jeans
And my eyes are closed
And Im way too tired
Hoody still smells of the beach bonfire
On the sofa where we lay
I wanna stay inside all day
And its cold outside again
And were both so high
We could fly to Berlin Tokyo or Jamaica
We can go where you want
Say the word and Ill take ya
But Id rather stay on the sofa
On the sofa with you
When the morning comes
Were not watching Formula I
Its not what we breathe for
So kick off the day with Friends on Tfour
Two boiled and brew
Two sugars aint too sweet for you
On the sofa where we lay
I wanna stay inside all day
And its cold outside again
And were still so high
We could fly to Berlin Tokyo or Jamaica
We can go where you want
Say the word and Ill take ya
But Id rather stay on the sofa
On the sofa with youAcross the sea
By the Tennessee skyline
They told me Id find my
Hopes and my dreams
I long to be
In the bed of my true love
Back where I came from
Shes waiting for me
So I make my way
Through long winding country roads
But my heart still beats
For my home and my English rose
I told my dad
On the phone its amazing
From the straight to the crazy the places Ive been
I long to be
In the arms of my true love
Like he loves my mother
He understands me
And I spend my days
Just traveling and playing shows
And my heart still beats
For my home and my English rose
Oooo-ooo-oooh
Oooo-aaa-aaah
Oo-aaa-aaa-aaah
I met a man
In the bar down in Munford
And he told me he went there to follow his dreams
He told me son
You know I left my true love
For the same exact reason
You crossed the sea
And I found truth
In people Ive never known
And my heart still beats for my home and my English rose
And my heart still beats for my home and my English rose
And my heart still beats for my home and my English rose
Across the sea
By the Tennessee skyline
They told me Id find my
Hopes and my dreams
I long to be
In the bed of my true love
Back where I came from
Shes waiting for me
So I make my way
Through long winding country roads

Keep careful watch of my brothers souls
And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke
Keep watching over Durins son
If this is to end in fire
Then we should all burn together
Watch the flames climb high into the night
Calling out for the rope sent by and we will
Watch the flames burn on and on the mountain side hey
And if we should die tonight
Then we should all die together
Raise a glass of wine for the last time
Calling out for the rope
Prepare as we will
Watch the flames burn on and on the mountain side
Desolation comes upon the sky
Now I see fire inside the mountain
I see fire burning the trees
And I see fire hollowing souls
And I see fire blood in the breeze
And I hope that youll remember me
Oh should my people fall
Then surely Ill do the same
Confined in mountain halls
We got too close to the flame
Calling out father hold fast and we will
Watch the flames burn on and on the mountain side
Desolation comes upon the sky
Now I see fire inside the mountain
I see fire burning the trees
And I see fire hollowing souls
And I see fire blood in the breeze
And I hope that youll remember me
And if the night is burning
I will cover my eyes
For if the dark returns then
My brothers will die
And as the skys falling down
It crashed into this lonely town
And with that shadow upon the ground
I hear my people screaming out
Now I see fire inside the mountain
I see fire burning the trees
And I see fire hollowing souls
And I see fire blood in the breeze
I see fire oh you know I saw a city burning fire
And I see fire feel the heat upon my skin fire
And I see fire fire
And I see fire burn on and on and mountains sideYou look so wonderful in your dress
I love your hair like that
The way it falls on the side of your neck
Down your shoulders and back
We are surrounded by all of these lies
And people who talk too much
Youve got that kind of look in your eyes
As if no one knows anything but us
And should this be the last thing I see
I want you to know its enough for me
Cause all that you are is all that Ill ever need
Im so in love so in love
So in love so in love
You look so beautiful in this light
Your silhouette over me
The way it brings out the blue in your eyes
Is the Tenerife sea
And all of the voices surrounding us here
They just fade out when you take a breath
Just say the word and I will disappear
Into the wilderness
And should this be the last thing I see
I want you to know its enough for me
Cause all that you are is all that Ill ever need
Im so in love so in love
So in love so in love

Lumiere over me

This is freaking awesome
Now Im pop some tags
Only got twenty dollars in my pocket
I-I-Im hunting looking for a come-up
This is freaking awesomeI write this song in memory of
The wayward smile
The boy we wont forget
The soul you took away from us
The river flows
The tears that we wept
Missing you
Is all that needs to be said
More than blue
The words inside my head
And I know that youre gone
The cheeky smile
Of jokes and laughs
The memories of times
We crossed the line
The stepping stones
Across my mind
Washed away
We all now feel so blind
Missing you
Is all that needs to be said
More than blue
The words inside my head
And I know that youre gone
GoodbyeI met this girl late last year
She said dont you worry if I disappear
I told her Im not really looking for another mistake
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jumped right in a week later returned
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you can swing by my room around ten
Baby bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
Well be in between the sheets till the late AM
Baby if you wanted me then you should have just said
Shes singing
Dont fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my own
I dont wanna know that babe
Dont fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I dont wanna know that babe
For a couple of weeks I only want to see her
We drink away the days with a take away pizza
Before a text message was the only way to reach her
Now shes staying at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha all over the track like a feature
And never wants to sleep I guess that I dont want to either
But me and her we make money the same way
Four cities two planes the same day
And those shows have never been what its about
Maybe well go together and just figure it out
Id rather put on a film with you and sit on the couch
But we should get on the plane or well be missing it now
Wish Id have written it down the way that things played out
When she was kissing him how
I was confused about
She should figure it out
Why Im sat here singing
Dont with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my own
I dont wanna know that babe
Dont fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I dont wanna know that babe
On my hotel door
I dont even know if she knows what for
She was crying on my shoulder
I already told you
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next
But you didnt need to to take him to bed thats all
And I never saw him as a threat
Until you disappeared with him to have sex of course
Its not like we were both on tour
We were staying on the same hotel floor
And I wasnt looking for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realize that you want it
Its a bit too much too late if Im honest
And all this time God knows Im singing
Dont fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my own
I dont wanna know that babe
Dont fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I dont wanna know that babe
Dont fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my own
I dont wanna know that babe
Dont fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I dont wanna know that babeHmhmhmhm ah ah
Hmhmhmhm ah ah
Hmhmhmhm ah ah
Hmhmhmhm ah ah
Ive known it for a long time
Daddy wakes up to a drink at night
Disappearing all night
I dont wanna know where hes been lying
I know what I wanna do
I wanna runaway
Runaway with you
Gonna grab clothes socks in the morning go
How long you leaving
Well Dad just dont expect me back this evening
Oh it could take a bit of time to heal this
Its been a long day
Almost out of the wrong way but
I love him from the skin to my bones ah
But I dont wanna miss home ah
Theres nothing to save and he knows ah
Ill just runaway in the overnight
Ive never seen my dad cry
Cold as stone and the kitchen lie
I tell you its about time
But I was raised to keep quiet
And this is what Im gonna do
Gonna runaway gonna make that move
Gonna grab clothes and when its morning go
How long you leaving
Well Dad just dont expect me back this evening
Oh it could take a bit of time to heal this
Its been a long day
Almost out of the wrong way but
I love him from the skin to my bones ah
But I dont wanna miss home ah
Theres nothing to save and he knows ah
Ill just runaway in the overnight
Back pack and a flat cap turned to the back
Cause I packed my clothes
My dad wasnt in with that plan too bit tired and turns to show up
I dont wanna live this way
Gonna take my things and go
If things change in a matter of days
Could be persuaded to hold up
And mama was the same
None of us the same
To get the good nose up
I dont wanna runaway
And one of these days I might just show that
Put my home in a suitcase
Tie both shoelaces and hold that
Things change but for now I leave town with a backpack on my shoulder
I love him from the skin to my bones ah
But I dont wanna miss home ah
Theres nothing to save and he knows ah
Ill just runaway in the overnightOoh Im a mess right now
Inside out
Searching for a sweet surrender
But this is not the end
I cant work it out
How
Going through the motions
Going through us
And though Ive known it for the longest time
And all my hope
All my words are all over written on the signs
But youre my road walking me home
Home home home home
See the flames inside my eyes
It burns so bright I wanna feel your love
Oh oh easy baby maybe Im a light
Before tonight I wanna fall in love
And put your faith in my stomach
I messed up this time
Late last night
Drinking to suppress devotion
With fingers intertwined
I cant shake this feeling now
Were going through the motions
Hoping youd stop
And though Ive only caused you pain
You know with all of my words
With were always beloved
Although all the lies spoke
When youre my road walking me home
Home home home home
See the flames inside my eyes
It burns so bright I wanna feel your love
Oh easy baby maybe Im a light
Before tonight I wanna fall in love
And put your faith in my stomach
And for how long Ive loved my lover
For how long Ive loved my lover
And now now for how long long Ive loved my lover
Now now for how long long Ive loved my lover
Now now for how long long Ive loved my lover
And I feel loved
For how long long Ive loved my lover

And I feel love
For how long long Ive loved my lover now now
For how long long Ive loved my loverI didnt mean to break your heart
I was just lonely
And everybody falls apart sometimes
I know youve found another one
But wont you just hold me tonight
I wish I never called you up
Nobody told me
And they dont know we dont speak anymore
So take a good look at us
Wont you just hold me tonight
And I will stop trying to fall in love again
And keep it a secret
It never works out anyway
But I am not anything like I was
Cause you were the only one for me
Yeah yeah
Cause maybe I dont wanna lose a lover and friend in one night
If thats right
I shouldnt have fucked with your mind
And your life too many times
Or maybe I dont wanna be lonely
Darling you are my only love
Behind my truth lies everything you are
I never meant to sleep around
I was just lonely
You did the same again and again and again
Oh I know
So heres to the both of us
Heres to our story tonight
Oh I will stop trying to fall in love again
And keep it a secret
It never works out anyway
But I am not anything like I was
Cause you were the only one for me
Hmm yeah
Maybe I dont wanna lose a lover and friend in one night
If thats right
I shouldnt have fucked with your mind
And your life too many times
Or maybe I dont wanna be lonely
Darling you are my only love
Behind my truth lies everything you are
When I see my future
It is with you
Well get there
I want my children to be with you
Well get there
hmm yeah
Cause maybe I dont wanna lose a lover and friend in one night
If thats right
I shouldnt have fucked with your mind
And your life too many times
Or maybe I dont wanna be lonely
Darling you are my only love
Behind my truth lies everything you are
Behind my truth lies everything you are
Behind my truth lies everything you areIts alright to cry
Even my dad does sometimes
So dont wipe your eyes
Tears can remind you of life
Its alright to die
If thats the only thing you havent tried
But just for tonight hold on
So live life like youre giving up
Cause you act like you are
Go ahead and just live it up
Go on and tear me apart
Its alright to shake
even my hand does sometimes
So inside well rage
Against the dying of the light
Its alright to say
that thats the only thing youve ever tried
But just for today
Hold On
So live life like youre giving up
Cause you act like you are
Go ahead and just live it up
Go on and tear me apart
Hold on
Live life like youre giving up
cause you act like you are
Go ahead and just live it up
Go on and tear me apart
and hold onThings were all good yesterday
And then the devil took your memory
And if you fell to your death today
I hope that heaven is your resting place
I heard the doctors put your chest in pain
But then that could have been the medicine
And now youre lying in the bed again
Either way Ill cry with the rest of them
And my father told me son
Its not his fault he doesnt know your face
And youre not the only one
Although my grandma used to say he used to say
Darling hold me in your arms the way you did last night
And well lie inside a little while he wrote
I could look into your eyes until the sun comes up
And were wrapped in light in life in love
Put your open lips on mine and slowly let them shut
For theyre designed to be together oh
With your body next to mine our hearts will beat as one
And were set alight were afire love love love oh
And things were all good yesterday
Then the devil took your breath away
And now were left here in the pain
Black suit black tie standin in the rain
And now my family is one again
Stapled together with the strangers and a friend
Came to my mind I should paint it with a pen
Six years old I remember when
And my father told me son
Its not his fault he doesnt know your face
And youre not the only one
Although my grandma used to say he used to say
Darling hold me in your arms the way you did last night
And well lie inside a little while he wrote
I could look into your eyes until the sun comes up
And were wrapped in light in life in love
Put your open lips on mine and slowly let them shut
For theyre designed to be together oh
With your body next to mine our hearts will beat as one
And were set alight were afire love love love oh
And my father and all of my family
Rise from the seats to sing hallelujah
And my mother and all of my family
Rise from the seats to sing halellujah
And my brother and all of my family
Rise from the seats to sing hallelujah
And all of my brothers and my sisters yeah
And my father and all of my family
Rise from the seats to sing hallelujah
HallelujahI met you when I was a teen
But then you were one as well
And I could play the guitar
Just like ringing the bells
Sometimes I wonder
And any other summer could you have been my part time lover
To me listening to Stevie Wonder
Under the covers where we used to lay
And read stacks while the speakers play
Ill be on tour almost every day
When I was home up in my flat is where we used to stay
Just watching the DVD smoking illegal weed
Getting high two cars we needed to breathe
We used each others edge just for the people to see
And stay up all night like when we needed to sleep
We go anywhere our minds would take us
And also you are beautiful without your make-up
And you dont even need to worry about your weight cause
We can all be loved the way that God made us
And times the only reason that we could break up
Cause you would always tell me Imma wait too much
Distance is relative to the time that it takes to get on a plane
Or make a mistake say it again
Oh Nina
You should go Nina
Cause I aint never coming home
In a road wont you leave me now
And Ive been living on the road Nina
And then again you should know Nina
Cause thats you and me
Both in a road wont you leave me now
Now
And every weekend in the winter
Youd be wearing my hood
With jewels strings pulled tight
To keep your face in the cold
Taking day trips to the local
Where we D on the road
Cause every day when I was a baby
Dont you speak on the phone
Watching Blue Planet
Creating new habits
And if we were two rabbits
And then youd vanish
Back to burrow all of the queltics are disappearing
You call me selfish I dont understand
But I cant help it
I put my trouble for everything
Except my family and friends
But youll be in between forever
So I guess well have to take a step back
Overlook the situation
Cause mixing business and feelings will only lead to complications
And Im not saying we should be taking a break
Just re-evaluating quick before we make a mistake and its too late
So we can either deal with the pain
Or wait to get on the plane
But in the day well have to say it again
Oh Nina
You should go Nina
Cause I aint never coming home
In a road wont you leave me now
And Ive been living on the road Nina
And then again you should know Nina
Cause thats you and me
Both in a road wont you leave me now
Now
Love will come and love will go
But you can make it on your own
Sing that song go oh wont you leave me now
People grow and fall apart
But you can mend your broken heart
Take it back oh wont you leave me now
Oh Nina Love will come and love will go
You should go Nina But you can make it on your own
Cause I aint never coming home Sing that song go
In a road wont you leave me now
And Ive been living on the road Nina People grow and fall apart
And then again you should know Nina But you can mend your broken heart
Cause thats you and me Take it back
Both in a road wont you leave me now
Now
Oh Nina Love will come and love will go
You should go Nina But you can make it on your own
Cause I aint never coming home Sing that song go
In a road wont you leave me now
And Ive been living on the road Nina People grow and fall apart
And then again you should know Nina But you can mend your broken heart
Cause thats you and me Take it back
Both in a road wont you leave me now
NowWhen your legs dont work like they used to before
And I cant sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks
And darling I will be loving you til were seventy
And baby my heart could still fall as hard at twenty-three
And Im thinking bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Oh me I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am
So honey now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
Im thinking out loud
Maybe we found love right where we are
When my hairs all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds dont remember my name
When my hands dont play the strings the same way mm
I know you will still love me the same
Cause honey your soul can never grow old its evergreen
Baby your smiles forever in my mind and memory
Im thinking bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe its all part of a plan
Ill just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that youll understand
But baby now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
Im thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are oh
Ah la la la la la la la la la la la la
So baby now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Oh darling place your head on my beating heart
Im thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are
Oh maybe we found love right where we are
And we found love right where we areYou and I two of a mind
This loves one of a kind
You and I were drifting
Over the edge
And I will fall for you
And I will fall for you
If I fall for you
Would you fall too
You and I learning to speak
With kisses on cheek
You and I were lifted over the edge
And I will fall for you
And I will fall for you
If I fall for you
Would you fall too
And I will fall for you
And I will fall for you
And if I fall for you
Would you fall too
Would you fall too
Would you fall too
Would you fall too
Would you fall tooI can taste salt water
And if I blink again
Youll be sinking in
So well learn to swim in the oceans you made
Ill hold ya and youll think of him
And pretty soon youll be floating away
And Ill hold on to the words you spoke of
Anchored down in the throat love
And Im captain of this sinking boat now
With just one armband to carry me home
When salted tears wont dry
Ill wipe my shirtsleeves
Under your eyes
These hearts will be flooded tonight
Ill wipe my shirtsleeves
Under your eyes
Your eyes your eyes your eyes your eyes your eyes
I still taste salt water
On my lips from your kiss bitterness
And Ill drown within the oceans you made
And I hate to love you these cuffs are covered in your make up
Ill never trust you again
You can just be a friend
And Ill hold on to the words you spoke of
Anchored down in the throat love
And Im captain of this sinking boat now
With just one armband to carry me home
When salted tears wont dry
Ill wipe my shirtsleeves
Under your eyes
These hearts will be flooded tonight
Ill wipe my shirtsleeves
Under your eyes
Your eyes your lips your mouth
Your thighs your back you drive me wild
Tonight the fact is I
Im on my way home
Im on my way home
I lied I tried to cry but Im Im drowning in the oceans you made
When salted tears wont dry
Ill wipe my shirtsleeves
Under your eyes
These hearts will be flooded tonight
Ill wipe my shirtsleeves
Under your eyes
Your eyes your eyes your eyes your eyes your eyesOoh Im a mess right now
Inside out
Searching for a sweet surrender
But this is not the end
I cant work it out
How
Going through the motions
Going through us
And though Ive known it for the longest time
And all my hope
All my words are all over written on the signs
But youre my road walking me home
Home home home home
See the flames inside my eyes
It burns so bright I wanna feel your love
Oh oh easy baby maybe Im a light
Before tonight I wanna fall in love
And put your faith in my stomach
I messed up this time
Late last night
Drinking to suppress devotion
With fingers intertwined
I cant shake this feeling now
Were going through the motions
Hoping youd stop
And though Ive only caused you pain
You know with all of my words
With were always beloved
Although all the lies spoke
When youre my road walking me home
Home home home home
See the flames inside my eyes
It burns so bright I wanna feel your love
Oh easy baby maybe Im a light
Before tonight I wanna fall in love
And put your faith in my stomach
And for how long Ive loved my lover
For how long Ive loved my lover
And now now for how long long Ive loved my lover
Now now for how long long Ive loved my lover
Now now for how long long Ive loved my lover
And I feel loved
For how long long Ive loved my lover
Feel it all over now now
And I feel love
For how long long Ive loved my lover
Feel it all over now now
And I feel love
For how long long Ive loved my lover
Feel it all over now now
And I feel love
For how long long Ive loved my lover
Feel it all over now now
And I feel love
For how long long Ive loved my lover
I feel it all over now now
And I feel love
For how long long Ive loved my lover now now
For how long long Ive loved my loverNow Im in town break it down thinking of making a new sound
Playing a different show every night in front of a new crowd
Thats you now ciao seems that life is great now
See me lose focus as I sing to you loud
And I cant no I wont hush
Ill say the words that make you blush
Im gonna sing this now
See Im true my songs are where my heart is
Im like glue I stick to other artists
Im not you now that would be disastrous
Let me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures
See Im real I do it all its all me
Im not fake dont ever call me lazy
I wont stay put give me the chance to be free
Suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me
Cause you need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you at all
You need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you at all
You need me
I sing and write my own tune
And I write my own verso
Dont need another word-smith to make my tune sell
Call yourself a singer-writer Youre just bluffing
Your names on the credits and you didnt write nothing
I sing fast I know that all my shits cool
I will blast and I didnt go to Brit School
I came fast with the way I act right
I cant last if Im smoking on a crack pipe
And I wont be a product of my genre
My mind will always be stronger than my songs are
Never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya
Always read the stories that you hear on Wikipedia
And musically Im demonstrating
When I perform live feels like I am meditating
Times at the Enterprise when some fella filmed me
A young singer-writer like Gabriella Cilmi
Cause you need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you at all
You need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you at all
You need me
Cause with the lyrics Ill be aiming it right
I wont stop till my names in light
At Stadium Heights with Damien Rice
On red carpets now Im on arabian nights
Because Im young and all my brothers gonna give me advice
Long nighter short height and Im gone hyper
Never be anything but a singer-songwriter
The games over but now Im on a new level
Watch how I step on the track without a loop pedal
People think that Im bound to blow up
Ive done around about a thousand shows
But I havent got a house plus I live on the couch
So you can be the lyrics when Im singing them out wow
From day one Ive been prepared
With Vfive wax for my ginger hair
So now Im back to the sofa giving a dose of what the future holds
Cause its another day plus Ill keep my last name forever keep the genre pretty basic
Gonna be breaking into other peoples tunes when I chase it
And replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift
Into another rappers shoes using new laces
Selling cds from my rucksack aiming for the papers
Selling cds from my rucksack aiming for majors
Nationwide til were just jack soon as I get the bus back
Clean cut kid without a razor for the mustache
I hit back when the pen hurts me
Im still a choir boy in a French church tee
Im still the same as a year ago
But more people hear me though
According to the myspace and youtube videos
Im always doing shows if Im not Im in the studio
Truly broke never growing up call me Ruffio
Melody music maker
Reading all the papers
They say Im up and coming like Im fucking in an elevator
Cause you need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you at all
You need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you at all
You need me man I dont need youLoving can hurt
Loving can hurt sometimes
But its the only thing that I know
When it gets hard
You know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive
We keep this love in a photograph
We make these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts are never broken
And times forever frozen still
So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me close until our eyes meet
You wont ever be alone
Wait for me to come home
Loving can heal
Loving can mend your soul
And its the only thing that I know know
I swear it will get easier
Remember that with every piece of ya
And its the only thing we take with us when we die
We keep this love in this photograph
We make these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Our hearts were never broken
And times forever frozen still
So you can keep me
inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me close until our eyes meet
You wont ever be alone
And if you hurt me
Thats okay baby there ll be worse things
Inside these pages you just hold me
I wont ever let you go
Wait for me to come home 
Oh you can keep me
Inside the necklace you got when you were sixteen
Next to your heartbeat where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul
And if you hurt me
Oh thats okay baby only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I wont ever let you go
When Im away
I will remember how you kissed me
Under the lamppost back on sixth street
Hearing you whisper through the phone
Wait for me to come homeGoodbye Norma Jean
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
They crawled out of the woodwork
And they whispered into your brain
They set you on the treadmill
And they made you change your name
And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would have liked to have known you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did
Loneliness was tough
The toughest role you ever played
Hollywood created a superstar
And pain was the price you paid
Even when you died
Oh the press still hounded you
All the papers had to say
Was that Marilyn was found in the nude
Goodbye Norma Jean
From the young man in the twenty-twond row
Who sees you as something as more than sexual
More than just our Marilyn MonroeYouve got scars on your body and your soul
Bruises on your back now
Broken heart with nowhere to go
Living in a high-rise flat
Torn apart so keep on keeping it together
Nothing is forever you know
You can start again like this like this
Chorus
Now I see blood in the sky
Blood in my eyesight
And everythings turning to red
Well beat it away color the nightlife
And light me up burn me today
Im seeing blood in the skyline
Stuck in the right mind
Afraid again to leave any dream
And replace it with anything better
So get up
And take away your scars
You can never be alone if youre bleeding with the skyline
Waiting for the right time
When the nights already gone
Its been traveling without your mind now
Let it let go and fuel you
Like petrol you find so much
Beauty in what makes you mental
Your friends know its only
A state of mind youre only getting by
By always getting high thats why
Chorus
Now I see blood in the sky
Blood in my eyesight
And everythings turning to red
Well beat it away color the nightlife
And light me up burn me today
Im seeing blood in the skyline
Stuck in the right mind
Afraid again to leave any dream
And replace it with anything better
So get up
And take away your scars
You can take away your scars
You can take away your scarsI met this girl late last year
She said dont you worry if I disappear
I told her Im not really looking for another mistake
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jumped right in a week later returned
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you can swing by my room around ten
Baby bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
Well be in between the sheets till the late AM
Baby if you wanted me then you should have just said
Shes singing
Dont fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my own
I dont wanna know that babe
Dont fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I dont wanna know that babe
For a couple of weeks I only want to see her
We drink away the days with a take away pizza
Before a text message was the only way to reach her
Now shes staying at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha all over the track like a feature
And never wants to sleep I guess that I dont want to either
But me and her we make money the same way
Four cities two planes the same day
And those shows have never been what its about
Maybe well go together and just figure it out
Id rather put on a film with you and sit on the couch
But we should get on the plane or well be missing it now
Wish Id have written it down the way that things played out
When she was kissing him how
I was confused about
She should figure it out
Why Im sat here singing
Dont with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my own
I dont wanna know that babe
Dont fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I dont wanna know that babe
On my hotel door
I dont even know if she knows what for
She was crying on my shoulder
I already told you
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next
But you didnt need to to take him to bed thats all
And I never saw him as a threat
Until you disappeared with him to have sex of course
Its not like we were both on tour
We were staying on the same hotel floor
And I wasnt looking for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realize that you want it
Its a bit too much too late if Im honest
And all this time God knows Im singing
Dont fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my own
I dont wanna know that babe
Dont fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I dont wanna know that babe
Dont fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my own
I dont wanna know that babe
Dont fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I dont wanna know that babeNo I dont wanna hate you
Just wish youd never gone for the man
And waited two weeks at least
Before you let him take you
I stayed true
I kind of knew you liked the dude from private school
Hes waiting for the time to move
I knew he had his eyes on you
Hes not the right guy for you
Dont hate me cause I write the truth
No I would never lie to you
But it was never fine to lose you
And what a way to find out
It never came from my mouth
You never changed your mind
But you were just afraid to mind out
But f- it I wont be changing the subject I love it
Ill make your little secret public its nothing
Im just disgusted with the skeletons you sleep with in your closet to get back at me
Trapped and Im lacking sleep
Fact is youre mad at me because I backtrack so casually
Youre practically my family
If we married then Ill guess youd have to be
But tragically our love just lost the will to live
But would I kill to give it one more shot
I think not
I dont love you baby
I dont need you baby
I dont want you no
Anymore
I dont love you baby
I dont need you baby
I dont wanna love you no
Anymore
Recently I tend to zone out
Up in my headphones to Holocene
You promised your body but Im away so much
I stay more celibate than in a monastery
Im not cut out for life on the road
Cause I didnt know Id miss you this much
And at the time wed just go so sue me
I guess Im not the man that you need
Ever since you went to uni
Ive been sofa surfing with a rucksack
Full of less cash and I guess that could get bad
But when I broke the industry
Thats when I broke your heart
I was supposed to chart and celebrate
But good things are over fast
I know its hard to deal with and see this
I tend to turn you off and switch on my professional features
Then I turn the music off
And all Im left with is to pick up my personal pieces Jesus
I never really want to believe this
Got advice from my dad and he
Told me that family is all Ill ever have and need
I guess Im unaware of it
Success is nothing if you have no one left to share it with
I dont love you baby
I dont need you baby
I dont want you no
Anymore
I dont love you baby
I dont need you baby
I dont wanna love you no
Anymore
And since you left
Ive given up my days off
Its what I need to stay strong
I know you have a day job
But mine is two hundred and forty-seven
I feel like writing a book
I guess I lied in the hook
Cause I still love you and I need you by my side if I could
The irony is if my career and music didnt exist
In six years yeah youd probably be my wife with a kid
Im frightened to think if I depend on cider and drink
And lighting a spliff I fall into a spiral and its
Just hiding my misguiding thoughts that Im trying to kill
And Id be writing my will before Im twenty-seven
Ill die from a thrill
Go down in history as just a wasted talent
Can I face the challenge
Or did I make a mistake erasing
Its only therapy
My thoughts just get ahead of me
Eventually Ill be fine I know that it was never meant to be
Either way I guess Im not prepared
But Ill say this
These things happen for a reason and you cant change
Take my apology
Im sorry for the honesty
But I had to get this off my chest
I dont love you baby
I dont need you baby
I dont want you no
Anymore
I dont love you baby
I dont need you baby
I dont wanna love you no
AnymoreVerse one
Im not a rapper Im a singer with a flow
Ive got a habit for spitting quicker lyrics you know
Youll find me ripping the writings out of the pages they sit in
I never want to get bitten cause plagiarism is hidden
Watch how I sit on the rhythm prisoner with the vision
Signed to a label but didnt listen to any criticism
Thought you knew but you didnt so perk your ears up and listen
The studio is a system and you could say that Im driven
And now its onto the next saga we drink the best lager
Ill never try to win you over like your stepfather
Ill do my own thing now and get respect after
And Im avoiding the cane like it was Get Carter
For four years I never had a place to stay
But its safe to say that it kept me grounded like a paperweight
At sixteen years old yeah I moved out of my home
I was Macy Gray I tried to say goodbye and I choked
And went from sleeping at a subway station to
Sleeping with a movie star and adding to the population
Not my imagination I dont wanna relax
Would it hurt your reputation if I put it on wax Ill take it back now
Hook
Mmm come on and take it back love
Come on and take it back for us
Dont you fade into the back love
Oh
I take it back with the rhythm and blues with my rat pack Ill be singing the news
Tryna act like Jack Black when I bring em to school
Ill make a beat with my feet by just hitting a loop
Bringing the lyrics to prove that I can fit in these shoes
Ill give you the truth through the vocal booth
And stars burst out when they seem like an Opal Fruit
They try to take aim like Beckham when he goes to shoot
But then again thats what theyre supposed to do
And Im supposed to be calm I tattooed the lyrics onto my arm
Whispering everything that happens is from now on
Ill be ready to start again by the end of the song
And still theyre claiming that I handle it wrong
But then Ive never had an enemy except the NME
But Ill be selling twice as many copies as their magazinesll ever be
With only spectacles ahead of me and festival fees
Are healthier than a dalmatian or pedigree
Singing for the masses rubber dinghy rapids
I keep this rapping a habit and keep em fashioning magic
Im battling for respect I dont know if Ill have it
This songs from the heart covered the planet Ill take it back now
Hook
Now I dont ever wanna be perfect
Cause Im a singer that you never wanna see shirtless
And I accept the fact that someones gotta win worst-dressed
Taking my first steps into the scene giving me focus
Putting on a brave face like Timothy Dalton
Considering a name change thinking it was hopeless
Rhyming over recordings avoiding tradition
Cause every day some lyrics and a melody could be written
An absence can make your heart break but drinking Absinthe
Can change your mind state vividly need to let my liver be
And Ill say it again living life on the edge with a closed hand for the friends
Its good advice from the man who took his life on the road for me
And I hope to see him blowing up globally
Cause thats how its supposed to be Im screaming out vocally
It might seem totally impossible achieving livesteams
But but I just write schemes Im never having
A stylist giving me tight jeans
Madison Square Garden is where I might be but more likely
Youll find me in the back room of a dive bar with my mates
Having a pint of McDaids discussing records we made
And every single second knowing that well never betray
The way we were raised remembering our background sat down
Thats how we plan it out its time to take it back now
Hook 
My dreams keep me awake at night written in rhyme
Till I deliver the hype am I just living a lie
With this you must know that the numbers just sold
Will keep me going through the tough times dream with me
We forget ninety of it when we wake
But the other ten it never fades
Dreaming dreams of day-to-day goals stay awake loads
Tried to make the cut like the paper with a razor blade
Oh never give up just remember just to hold out more
A couple years ago I couldnt just control that thought
Youd find me busking on the street when it was cold outdoors
Now Im sweating on the stage of a sold-out tour
Writing love songs for the sake of it never to make a hit
You cant fake talent and work ethic just to make it quick
Im not a rapper Im a singer I just take the piss
And most of these other guys are kids that s little sister has to
Babysit thats just the way it is
Dreams are your own just set your goals and have the upmost faith in it
Tread your own path youll never make it as a follower
Youll never know where you will go or you will be tomorrow
IGHIts late in the evening
Glass on the side now
Ive been sat with you
For most of the night
Ignoring everybody here
We wish they would disappear
So maybe we could get down now
I dont wanna know
If youre getting ahead of the program
I want you to be mine lady
To hold your body close
Take another step into the no-mans land
For the longest time lady
I need you darling
Come on set the tone
If you feel youre falling
Wont you let me know oh
Oh ooh
If you love me come on get involved
Feel it rushing through you from your head to toe oh
Oh ooh
Sing oh oh
Oh oh
Louder oh oh
Sing oh oh
This love is a blaze
I saw flames from the side of the stage
And the fire brigade comes in a couple of days
Until then we got nothing to say and nothing to know
But something to drink and maybe something to smoke
Let it go until I wrote a change singing we found love in a local raid no
I dont really know what Im supposed to say
But I can just figure it out and hope and pray
I told them my name and said its nice to meet ya
Then she handed me of a bottle of water filled with tequila
I already know shes a keeper
Just from this one small act of kindness Im in deep
If anybody finds out Im meant to drive home
But Im drunk and gonna live it now no
We just sit on the couch one thing led to another now shes kissing my mouth
I need you darling
Come on set the tone
If you feel youre falling
Wont you let me know oh
Oh
If you love me come on get involved
Feel it rushing through you from your head to toe oh
Oh
Sing oh oh
Oh oh
Louder oh oh
Sing oh oh
Can you feel it
All the guys in here dont really wanna dance
Can you feel it
All that I can hear is music from the back
Can you feel it
Found you hiding here so hoped youd take my hand darling
Before the beats kicks in again
Can you feel it oh
Can you feel it oh no no no
Sing I need you darling
Come on set the tone
If you feel youre falling
Wont you let me know louder oh
Oh
Sing If you love me come on get involved
Feel it rushing through you from your head to toe louder oh
Oh
SingIts just another night
And Im staring at the moon
I saw a shooting star
And thought of you
I sang a lullaby
By the waterside and knew
If you were here
Id sing to you
Youre on the other side
As the skyline splits in two
Im miles away from seeing you
I can see the stars
From America
I wonder do you see them too
So open your eyes and see
The way our horizons meet
And all of the lights will lead
Into the night with me
And I know these scars will bleed
But both of our hearts believe
All of these stars will guide us home
I can hear your heart
On the radio beat
Theyre playing Chasing Cars
And I thought of us
Back to the time
You were lying next to me
I looked across and fell in love
So I took your hand
Back through lamp lit streets I knew
Everything led back to you
So can you see the stars
Over Amsterdam
Youre the song my heart is
Beating to
So open your eyes and see
The way our horizons meet
And all of the lights will lead
Into the night with me
And I know these scars will bleed
But both of our hearts believe
All of these stars will guide us homeWere not no were not friends nor have we ever been
We just try to keep those secrets in a lie
And if they find out will it all go wrong
And Heaven knows no one wants it to
So I could take the back road
But your eyes will lead me straight back home
And if you know me like I know you
You should love me you should know
Friends just sleep in another bed
And friends dont treat me like you do
Well I know that theres a limit to everything
But my friends wont love me like you
No my friends wont love me like you
Were not friends we could be anything
If we try to keep those secrets safe
No one will find out if it all went wrong
Theyll never know what weve been through
So I could take the back road
But your eyesll lead me straight back home
And if you know me like I know you
You should love me you should know
Friends just sleep in another bed
And friends dont treat me like you do
Well I know that theres a limit to everything
But my friends wont love me like you
No my friends wont love me like you
But then again if were not friends
Someone else might love you too
And then again if were not friends
Thered be nothing I could do and thats why
Friends should sleep in other beds
And friends shouldnt kiss me like you do
And I know that theres a limit to everything
But my friends wont love me like you
No my friends wont love me like you do
Oh my friends will never love me like youI met this girl late last year

Ive got a habit of spitting
Quicker lyrics you know
You found me ripping the writtens
Out of the pages they sit in
And never once I get bitten
Because plagiarism is hidden
Which I would sit on the rhythm
Prisoner with a vision
Signs of a label but didnt listen to any criticism
Thought you knew but you didnt
So perk your ears up and listen
Studio is a system
And you could say that Im driven
And now its on to the next saga
We drink the best lager
I never tried to win you over
Like your stepfather
I do my own thing now and get respect after
And Im avoiding cocaine like it was Get Carter
For four years I never had a place to stay
But its safe to say that it kept me grounded like a paperweight
At sixteen years old yeah I moved out of my home
I was Macy Gray I tried to say goodbye and I choked
And went from sleeping at the subway station

Would it hurt your reputation if I put it on wax
Ill take it back now
Mmmm cmon and take it back love
Cmon and take it back for us
Dont you fade into the back love
No
I take it back with the rhythm and blues
With my rap pack Ill be singing the news
Trying to act like Jack Black when I bring em to school
Ill make a beat with my feet by just hitting a loop
Bringing the lyrics to prove that I can fit in these shoes
I give you the truth through the vocal booth
Stars burst out on the scene like an opal fruit
They try and take aim like Beckham when he goes to shoot
But then again thats what theyre supposed to do
And Im supposed to be calm
I tattooed the lyrics onto my arm
Whispering everything that happens is from now on
Ill be ready to start again at the end of the song
Still their claiming that I handled it wrong
But then I never had an enemy except for NME
But Ill be selling twice as many copies as the magazines will ever be
With only spectacles ahead of me and festival fees
Im healthier than a Dalmatian on Pedigree
Singing for the masses
Rubber dinghy rapids
Keep this rapping a habit
And keep on passioning magic
Im battling for respect
I dont know if Ill have it
This songs from the heart
Cover the planet
Ill take it back now
Mmmm cmon and take it back love
Cmon and take it back for us
Dont you fade into the back love
No
Take it back now
Now I dont ever want to be perfect
Cause Im a singer that you
Never want to see shirtless
And I accept the fact that someone has to win worst-dressed
Taking my first steps into the scene
Giving me focus
Putting on a brave face like Timothy Dalton
Considering a name change
Thinking it was hopeless
Rhyming over recordings
Avoiding tradition
Cause every day some lyrics
And a melody can be written
Now absence can make your heart break
But drinking absinthe can change your mind-state vividly
I need to let my liver be
And I say it again
Living life on the edge
With a closed hand full of friends
Is good advice from a man
Who took his life on the road with me
And I hope to see him blowing up globally
Cause thats how its supposed to be
Im screaming out vocally
It might seem totally impossible
Achieving lifes dreams
But but I just write schemes
Im never having a stylist giving me tight jeans
Madison Square Garden is where I might be
But more likely
Youll find me in the back
Room of a dive bar with my mates
Having a pint with McDaid
Discussing records we made
And every single second knowing
That well never betray
The way we were raised
Remembering our background
Sat down
Thats how we plan it out
Its time to take it back now
Mmmm cmon and take it back love
Cmon and take it back for us
Dont you fade into the back love
No
Mmmm cmon and take it back love
Cmon and take it back for us
Dont you fade into the back love
NoYou look so wonderful in your dress
I love your hair like that
The way it falls on the side of your neck
Down your shoulders and back
We are surrounded by all of these lies
And people who talk too much
Youve got that kind of look in your eyes
As if no one knows anything but us
And should this be the last thing I see
I want you to know its enough for me
Cause all that you are is all that Ill ever need
Im so in love so in love
So in love so in love
You look so beautiful in this light
Your silhouette over me
The way it brings out the blue in your eyes
Is the Tenerife sea
And all of the voices surrounding us here
They just fade out when you take a breath
Just say the word and I will disappear
Into the wilderness
And should this be the last thing I see
I want you to know its enough for me
Cause all that you are is all that Ill ever need
Im so in love so in love
So in love so in love
Lumiere darling
Lumiere over me
Lumiere darling
Lumiere over me
Lumiere darling
Lumiere over me
And should this be the last thing I see
I want you to know its enough for me
Cause all that you are is all that Ill ever need
Im so in love so in love
So in love love love love
So in love
You look so wonderful in your dress
I loved your hair like that
And in the moment I knew you BethNow Im in town break it down thinking of making a new sound
Playing a different show every night in front of a new crowd
Thats you now ciao seems that life is great now
See me lose focus as I sing to you loud
And I cant no I wont hush
Ill say the words that make you blush
Im gonna sing this now
See Im true my songs are where my heart is
Im like glue I stick to other artists
Im not you now that would be disastrous
Let me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures
See Im real I do it all its all me
Im not fake dont ever call me lazy
I wont stay put give me the chance to be free
Suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me
Cause you need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you at all
You need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you at all
You need me
I sing and write my own tune
And I write my own verso
Dont need another word-smith to make my tune sell
Call yourself a singer-writer Youre just bluffing
Your names on the credits and you didnt write nothing
I sing fast I know that all my shits cool
I will blast and I didnt go to Brit School
I came fast with the way I act right
I cant last if Im smoking on a crack pipe
And I wont be a product of my genre
My mind will always be stronger than my songs are
Never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya
Always read the stories that you hear on Wikipedia
And musically Im demonstrating
When I perform live feels like I am meditating
Times at the Enterprise when some fella filmed me
A young singer-writer like Gabriella Cilmi
Cause you need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you at all
You need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you at all
You need me
Cause with the lyrics Ill be aiming it right
I wont stop till my names in light
At Stadium Heights with Damien Rice
On red carpets now Im on arabian nights
Because Im young and all my brothers gonna give me advice
Long nighter short height and Im gone hyper
Never be anything but a singer-songwriter
The games over but now Im on a new level
Watch how I step on the track without a loop pedal
People think that Im bound to blow up
Ive done around about a thousand shows
But I havent got a house plus I live on the couch
So you can be the lyrics when Im singing them out wow
From day one Ive been prepared
With Vfive wax for my ginger hair
So now Im back to the sofa giving a dose of what the future holds
Cause its another day plus Ill keep my last name forever keep the genre pretty basic
Gonna be breaking into other peoples tunes when I chase it
And replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift
Into another rappers shoes using new laces
Selling cds from my rucksack aiming for the papers
Selling cds from my rucksack aiming for majors
Nationwide til were just jack soon as I get the bus back
Clean cut kid without a razor for the mustache
I hit back when the pen hurts me
Im still a choir boy in a French church tee
Im still the same as a year ago
But more people hear me though
According to the myspace and youtube videos
Im always doing shows if Im not Im in the studio
Truly broke never growing up call me Ruffio
Melody music maker
Reading all the papers
They say Im up and coming like Im fucking in an elevator
Cause you need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you at all
You need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you
You need me man I dont need you at all
You need me man I dont need youWell I walked from my house to yours
In a warm cold April rain
We barely went outdoors
And your family took the blame
Take time to be with you
She can only glare
Im a bad influence
Thatll do cause I need to cut my hair
Wash my mouth
Change my clothes
Just dont talk those friends of yours
Tell them not to come here anymore
Time to go dont be slow
Thisll only take a mo
Take yourself right off my door
Its just that they dont care
Dad said Beware watch your back
And just dont reply to the woman there
Even if she makes a fuss just ignore that trust
And Dont give into lust
And Leave that one alone the girls a trouble
Time spent in burnt-down shed
Add up near two days
Fall down and cut my head
Take time to misbehave
Spend time and be with you
She can only glare cause
Youre a bad influence
Thatll do boy you need to cut your hair
Wash my mouth
Change my clothes
Just dont talk those friends of yours
Tell them not to come here anymore
Time to go dont be slow
Thisll only take a mo
Take yourself right off my door
Its just that they dont care
Dad said Beware watch your back
And just dont reply to the woman there
Even if she makes a fuss just ignore that trust
And Dont give into lust
And Leave that one alone the girls a trouble
This is the dancing song
Close your eyes
Hypnotise to the beat
And the movement of the week
Do that shuffle of your feet
And pound out the fever
Either dance cause youre a true believer
Cleaner lives are what you dont see
Feel the weight
Gravitate
Feel the pace of me
This world is twoD
The only thing thats free in life is love
And that dont come cheap
Its just that they dont care
Dad said Beware watch your back
And just dont reply to the woman there
Even if she makes a fuss just ignore that trust
And Dont give into lust
And Leave that one alone the girls a troubleOh misty eye of the mountain below
Keep careful watch of my brothers souls
And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke
Keep watching over Durins son
If this is to end in fire
Then we should all burn together
Watch the flames climb high into the night
Calling out for the rope sent by and we will
Watch the flames burn on and on the mountain side hey
And if we should die tonight
Then we should all die together
Raise a glass of wine for the last time
Calling out for the rope
Prepare as we will
Watch the flames burn on and on the mountain side
Desolation comes upon the sky
Now I see fire inside the mountain
I see fire burning the trees
And I see fire hollowing souls
And I see fire blood in the breeze
And I hope that youll remember me
Oh should my people fall
Then surely Ill do the same
Confined in mountain halls
We got too close to the flame
Calling out father hold fast and we will
Watch the flames burn on and on the mountain side
Desolation comes upon the sky
Now I see fire inside the mountain
I see fire burning the trees
And I see fire hollowing souls
And I see fire blood in the breeze
And I hope that youll remember me
And if the night is burning
I will cover my eyes
For if the dark returns then
My brothers will die
And as the skys falling down
It crashed into this lonely town
And with that shadow upon the ground
I hear my people screaming out
Now I see fire inside the mountain
I see fire burning the trees
And I see fire hollowing souls
And I see fire blood in the breeze
I see fire oh you know I saw a city burning fire
And I see fire feel the heat upon my skin fire
And I see fire fire
And I see fire burn on and on and mountains sideLoving can hurt loving can hurt sometimes
But its the only thing that I know
When it gets hard you know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive
We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts are never broken
And times forever frozen still
So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me closer til our eyes meet
You wont ever be alone wait for me to come home
Loving can heal loving can mend your soul
And its the only thing that I know know
I swear it will get easier
Remember that with every piece of you
Hm and its the only thing we take with us when we die
Hm we keep this love in this photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts were never broken
And times forever frozen still
So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me closer til our eyes meet
You wont ever be alone
And if you hurt me
Thats okay baby only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I wont ever let you go
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
You can fit me
Inside the necklace you got when you were sixteen
Next to your heartbeat where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul
And if you hurt me
Well thats okay baby only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I wont ever let you go
When Im away I will remember how you kissed me
Under the lamppost back on Sixth street
Hearing you whisper through the phone
Wait for me to come homeIve been spinning out for time
Couple women by my side
I got sinnin on my mind
Sipping on red wine
Ive been sitting here for ages
Ripping out pages
Howd I get so faded
Howd I get so faded
Oh
No no dont leave me lonely now
If you love me how
You never loved me
Ooh
Color crimson in my eyes
Wanted to could free my mind
This is how it ends
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
Fading out again
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
So tell me when it kicks in
Well tell when it kicks in
Ive been looking for a love
Thought Id find it really boring
God make me another one
Ill be feeling this tomorrow
Lord forgive me for the things Ive done
I was never meant to hurt no one
And I saw scars upon her broken hearted dove
Oh
No no dont leave me lonely now
If you love me how
You never loved me
Ooh
Color crimson in my eyes
Wanted to could free my mind
This is how it ends
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
Fading out again

Even my dad does sometimes
So dont wipe your eyes
Tears remind you youre alive
Its alright to die
Cause deaths the only thing you havent tried
But just for tonight hold on
So live life like youre giving up
Cause you act like you are
Go ahead and just live it up
Go on and tear me apart
Its alright to shake
Even my hand does sometimes
So inside the rage
Against the dying of the light
Its alright to say that deaths the only thing you havent tried
But just for today hold on
So live life like youre giving up
Cause you act like you are
Go ahead and just live it up
Go on and tear me apart hold onTell me that you turned down the man
Who asked for your hand
Cause youre waiting for me
And I know youre gonna be away a while
But Ive got no plans at all to leave
And would you take away my hopes and dreams
Just stay with me
All my senses come to life
While Im stumbling home as drunk as I
Have ever been and Ill never leave again
Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me youll never leave again
Cause you are the only one
Take my hand and my
Heart and soul I will
Only have these eyes for you
And you know everything changes but
Well be strangers if we see this through
You could stay within these walls and bleed
But just stay with me
All my senses come to life
While Im stumbling home as drunk as I
Have ever been and Ill never leave again
Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me youll always be a friend
Cause you are the only one
Im stumbling off drunk getting myself lost
I am so gone so tell me the way home
I listen to sad songs singing about love
And where it goes wrong
All my senses come to life
While Im stumbling home as drunk as I
Have ever been and Ill never leave again
Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me youll always be a friend
Cause you are the only oneWhen the sins of my father
Weigh down in my soul
And the pain of my mother
Will not let me go
Well I know there can come fire from the sky
To refine the purest of kings
And even though
I know this fire brings me pain
Even so
And just the same
Make it rain
Make it rain down low
Make it rain
Oh make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain down low
Make it rain
Make it rain
The seed needs the water
Before it grows out of the ground
But it just keeps on getting hard
And the hunger more profound
Well I know there can come tears from the eye
But they may as well be in vain
Even though
I know these tears come with pain
Even so
And just the same
Make it rain
Make it rain down low
Make it rain
Oh make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain down low
Make it rain
Make it rain
And the seas are full of water
That stops by the shore
Just like the riches of grandeur oh no no
Never reach the port
So let the clouds fill with thunderous applause
And let lightning be the veins
That fill the sky
With all that they can drop
When its time to make a change
Make it rain
Make it rain down low
Make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain down low
Make it rain
Oh make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain
Oh make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain down low
Make it rain
Oh make it rain
Make it rain

This love is a blaze
I saw flames from the side of the stage
And the fire brigade comes in a couple of days
Until then we got nothing to say and nothing to know
But something to drink and maybe something to smoke
Let it go until I wrote a change singing we found love in a local raid no
I dont really know what Im supposed to say
But I can just figure it out and hope and pray
I told them my name and said its nice to meet ya
Then she handed me of a bottle of water filled with tequila
I already know shes a keeper
Just from this one small act of kindness Im in deep
If anybody finds out Im meant to drive home
But Im drunk and gonna live it now no
We just sit on the couch one thing led to another now shes kissing my mouth
I need you darling
Come on set the tone

What you do to me is enlighten my mind
Oh wow I said
Sara
What you do to me is make my soul unwind
Hey now
Cos your hair is blonde your eyes are blue
Half the guys I know are after you
Cheer me up when Im in a mood
So I thought Id write a song for you
And may I say you look like an angel today
May I say take me to the place where your mind lays
If only to make you smile today
Cos you are great I thought Id say that
Sara reminds me of drunken talks in a hammock
Behind a can of Strongbow
Oh wow I said
Sara you say that you dont look good when you do
Even with that soul
Your hair is blonde your eyes are blue
Half the guys I know are after you
Cheer me up when Im in a mood
So I thought Id write a song for you
And may I say you look like an angel today
May I say take me to the place where your mind lays
If only to make you smile today
Cos you are great I thought Id say that
