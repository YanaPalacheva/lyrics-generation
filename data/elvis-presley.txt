Some things are meant to be
Take my hand take my whole life too
For I cant help falling in love with you

Some things are meant to be
Take my hand take my whole life too
For I cant help falling in love with you

The cattle are prowlin and the coyotes are howlin
Way out where the dogies bawl
Where spurs are a-jinglin a cowboy is singin
This lonesome cattle call
Woo-hoo woo-hoo hoo hoo
Woo-hoo woo-hoo hoo hoo
Woo-hoo woo-hoo hoo hoo hoo
Woo-hoo woo-hoo hoo
He rides in the sun till his days work is done
And he rounds up the cattle each fall
Woo-hoo woo-hoo hoo hoo
Singin his cattle call
For hours he will ride on the range far and wide
When the night wind blows up a squall
His heart is a feather in all kinds of weather
He sings his cattle call
Woo-hoo woo-hoo hoo hoo
Woo-hoo woo-hoo hoo hoo
Woo-hoo woo-hoo hoo hoo hoo
Woo-hoo woo-hoo hoo
Hes brown as a berry from ridin the prairie
And sings with an ol western drawl
Woo-hoo woo-hoo hoo hoo
Singin his cattle callHey little girl you sure are cute to me

Get ready honey lets go just-a one more timeWhen I was a child ladies and gentlemen I was a dreamer
I read comic books and I was the hero of the comic book I saw movies and I
was the hero in the movieSo every dream I ever dreamed has come true a hundred
times These gentlemen over there these are the type who care are dedicated
You realize if its not possible that they might be building the kingdom
its not far-fetched from reality Id like to say that I learned
very early in life that
Without a song the day would never end
Without a song a man aint got a friend
Without a song the road would never bend
Without a song
So I keep singing a song
Good night
Thank youDo you or dont you love me
Such an easy question
Why cant I get an answer
Tell me will you or wont you need me
Such an easy question
Why cant I get an answer
All you do is give a sigh
And beat around the bush
Can it be that youre too shy
To give yourself a little old push
Can you or cant you tell me yes
Its such an easy question
Why cant I get an answerIts a long lonely highway when youre travellin all alone
And its a mean old world when you got no one to call your own
And you pass through towns too small to even have a name oh yes
But you gotta keep on goin on that road to nowhere
Gotta keep on goin though theres no one to care
Just keep movin down the line
Its a long lonely highway without her by my side
And its a trail full of teardrops that keep on being cried
My hearts so heavy its a low down dirty shame oh yes
You gotta keep on goin on that road to nowhere
Gotta keep on goin though theres no one to care
Just keep movin down the line
I gotta rock for my pillow neath a weeping willow
And the cool grass for my bed
My drinking waters muddy so dont you tell me buddy
That I wouldnt be better off dead
Its a long lonely highway gettin longer all the time
And if she dont come and get me
Well Im gonna lose my mind
So if you read about me tell her shes the one to blame oh yes
You gotta keep on goin on that road to nowhere
Gotta keep on goin though theres no one to care
Just keep movin down the lineCOLD COLD HEAR
Elvis Presley Willie Nelson three hundred and five
Written by Hank Williams

I tried so hard my dear to show that youre my every dream
Yet youre afraid each thing I do is just some evil scheme
Now a memory from your lonesome past keeps us so far apart
Why cant I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold cold heart

Another love before my time made your heart sad and blue
And so my heart is paying now for things I didnt do
In anger unkind words are said they make the teardrops start
Why cant I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold cold heart


Yeah there was a time when I believed that you belonged to me
But now I know your heart is shackled to a memory

The more I learn to care for you the more we drift apart
Why cant I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold cold heart
Why cant I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold cold heartNow blue aint the word for the way that I feel
That old storm brewing in this heart of mine
Someday crazy arms will hold somebody new
But now Im so lonely all the time
Crazy arms that needs to hold somebody new
While your heart keeps sayin your not mine not mine
Not mine not mine my troubled minds grows blue
To another youll be wed but now Im so lonely all the time
Now take all those precious dreams I had for you dear
And take all that love I thought was mine
Some day your crazy arms will hold somebody new
But now I m so lonely all the time
Crazy arms that reach to hold somebody new
While my yearning heart keeps saying your not mine
Not mine not mine not mine my troubled mind goes blue
To another youll be wed but now Im so lonely all the timeThis thing called love I just cant handle it
This thing called love I must get round to it
I aint ready
Crazy little thing called love
This thing called love
It cries in a cradle all night
It swings it jives
It shakes all over like a jellyfish
I kinda like it
Crazy little thing called love
There goes my baby
She knows how to rock and roll
She drives me crazy
She gives me hot and cold fever
Then she leaves me in a cool cool sweat
I gotta be cool relax
Get hip get on my tracks
Take a back seat hitch-hike
And take a long ride on my motor bike
Until Im ready
Crazy little thing called love
I gotta be cool relax
Get hip and get on my tracks
Take a back seat hitch-hike
And take a long ride on my motor bike
Until Im ready
Crazy little thing called love
This thing called love I just cant handle it
This thing called love I must get round to it
I aint ready

This was gonna be the night tonight
I was gonna get to hold you tight
But I guess we didnt plan it right
I never stood a chance we couldnt dance
Cause theres no room to rhumba in a sports car
You cant move forward or back
Theres no room to do what the beat tells you to
Without throwing your spine outta wack
When a little kiss I want to steal
I hit my head against the steering wheel
Now I know the way a pretzel feels
All I can do is shoutHey let me out
Cause theres no room to rhumba in a sports car
You cant move forward or back
Theres no room to do what the beat tells you to
Without throwing your spine outta wack
What a way to waste a day with you
Nothing happens that can tell the truth
Lets go out and find a telephone booth
Yeah thats a better place I like more space
Cause theres no room to rhumba in a sports car
You cant move forward or back
Theres no room to do what the beat tells you to
Without throwing your spine outta wackWords music by Preston Foster Elvis Presley

ha ha ha ha haI HEARD THE BELLS ON CHRISTMAS
Elvis Presley
Written by
I heard the bells on Christmas day
Their old familiar carols play
And wild and sweet the words repeat
Of peace on earth good will to men
I thought how as the day had come
The belfries of all Christendom
Had rolled along the unbroken song
Of peace on earth good will to men
And in despair I bowed my head
There is no peace on earth I said
For hate is strong and mocks the song
Of peace on earth good will to men
Then pealed the bells more loud and deep
God is not dead nor doth he sleep
The wrong shall fail the right prevail
With peace on earth good will to men
With peace on earth good will to men
Merry ChristmasThats what you get for loving me
Thats what you get for loving me
Everything we had is gone you can see

Now dont you shed a tear for me
I aint the love you thought Id be
Ive had a hundred just like you
But dont be blue Ill have a thousand before Im through
Thats what you get for loving me
Thats what you get for loving me
Everything we had is gone you can see
Thats what you get for loving me
Now there you go youre cryin again
You should have known how things would end
But then some day when your poor heart is on the mend
I just might pass this way againAmenAmenAmenAmenAmen sing it with us everybody AmenAmenAmenAmenAmenright half a staff AmenAmenAmenAmenAmentake it up one more half now AmenAmenAmenAmenAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAmenLord almighty

Your kisses lift me higher
Like the sweet song of a choir
You light my morning sky
With burning love
Ooh ooh ooh
I feel my temperature rising
Help me Im flaming
I must be a hundred and nine
Burning burning burning
And nothing can cool me
I just might turn into smoke
But I feel fine
Cause your kisses lift me higher
Like a sweet song of a choir
And you light my morning sky
With burning love
Its coming closer
The flames are now licking my body
Wont you help me
I feel like Im slipping away
Its hard to breath
My chest is a heaving
Lord have mercy
Im burning a hole where I lay
Your kisses lift me higher
Like the sweet song of a choir
You light my morning sky
With burning love

A hunk a hunk of burning loveIn the early mornin rain
With a dollar in my hand
And an aching in my heart
And my -pockets full of sand
Im a long ways from home
And I missed my loved one so
In the early mornin rain
With no place to go
Out on runway number nine
Big seven hundred and seven set to go
Well Im out here on the grass
Where the pavement never grows
Where the liquor tasted good
And the women all were fast
There she goes my friend
Shes rolling out at last
Hear the mighty engines roar
See the silver wing on high
Shes away and westward bound
For above the clouds she flies
Where the mornin rain dont fall
And the sun always shines
Shell be flying over my home
In about three hours time
This ol airports got me down
Its no earthly good to me
Cause Im stuck here on the ground
Cold and drunk as I might be
Cant jump a jet plane
Like you can a freight train
So I best be on my way
In the early mornin rain
So I best be on my way
In the early mornin rain
So I best be on my way
In the early mornin rainWise men say only fools rush in
But I cant help falling in love with you
Shall I stay
Would it be a sin
If I cant help falling in love with you
Like a river flows surely to the sea
Darling so it goes
Some things are meant to be
Take my hand take my whole life too
For I cant help falling in love with you
Like a river flows surely to the sea
Darling so it goes
Some things are meant to be
Take my hand take my whole life too
For I cant help falling in love with you
For I cant help falling in love with youNight and you
And blue Hawaii
The night is heavenly
And you are heaven to me
Lovely you
And blue Hawaii
With all this loveliness
There should be love
Come with me
While the moon is on the sea
The night is young
And so are we so are we
Dreams come true
In blue Hawaii
And mine could all come true
This magic night of nights with youThis is the moment
Ive waited for
I can hear my heart singing
Soon bells will be ringing
This is the moment

Old times they are not forgotten
Look away look away look away Dixieland
Oh I wish I was in Dixie away away
In Dixieland I take my stand to live and die in Dixie
For Dixieland I was born
Early Lord one frosty morn
Look away look away look away Dixieland

His truth is marching on
So hush little baby
Dont you cry
You know your daddys bound to die
But all my trials Lord soon be overI cant stop loving you
So Ive made up my mind
To live in memory
Of such an old lonesome time
I cant stop wanting you
Its useless to say
So Ill just live my life
In dreams of yesterday
Those happy hours
That we once knew
Though long ago
They still make me blue
They say that time
Heals a broken heart
But time has stood still
Since weve been apartHear that lonesome winter bird
He sounds too blue to fly
The midnight train is whining low
Im so lonesome I could cry
Did you ever see a robin weep
When leaves began to die
That means hes lost the will to live
Im so lonesome I could cry
The silence of a falling star
Lights up a purple sky
And as I wonder where you are
Im so lonesome I could cry
Im so lonesome I could cryNever know how much I love you
Never know how much I care
When you put your arms around me
I get a fever thats so hard to bear
You give me fever when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning
Fever all through the night
Sun lights up the daytime
Moon lights up the night
I light up when you call my name
And you know Im gonna treat you right
You give me fever when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning
Fever all through the night
Everybodys got the fever
That is something you all know
Fever isnt such a new thing
Fever started long ago
Romeo loved Juliet
Juliet she felt the same
When he put his arms around her
He said Julie baby youre my flame
Thou give us fever when we kisseth
Fever with thy flaming youth
Fever Im on fire
Fever yea I burn for sooth
Captain Smith and Pocahontas
Had a very mad affair
When her daddy tried to kill him
She said daddy o dont you dare
He gives me fever with his kisses
Fever when he holds me tight
Fever Im his misses
Oh daddy wont you treat him right
Now youve listened to my story
Heres the point that I have made
Cats were born to give chicks fever
Be it Fahrenheit or Centigrade
They give you fever when they kiss you
Fever if you live and learn
Fever till you sizzle
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burnWhether youre riding down a highway
Or walkin down a street
It makes no difference baby
Im gonna love you just as mean
Cause holdin your little hand
Makes me feel so very nice
Anyplace is paradise
When Im with you
Whether were standin on a doorstep
Or sittin at a park
Or strollin down shady lane
Or dancin in the dark
Well I can take you in my arms
And look into your pretty eyes
Anyplace is paradise
When Im with you
Give me a cave up in the mountain
Or a shack down by the sea
And I will be in heaven honey
If you are there with me
Well kiss your pretty lips
See the love-light in your eyes
Anyplace is paradise
When Im with you
Baby Id live deep in the jungle
And sleep up in a tree
And let the rest of the world go be
If you were there with me
Well I could love you all the time
Baby a jungle would be fine
Anyplace is paradise
When Im with youI said Id hold I said Id hold
I said Id hold you in my heart till I can hold you in my arms
Like youve never been held before
Well Ill think of you each day and then Ill dream the night away
Oh till you are in my arms once more
The stars up in the sky you know they know the reason why
I feel so blue cause Im away from you
Yeah Ill hold you in my heart till I can hold you in my arms
Oh darling please wait for me
You know the stars up in the sky you know they know the reason why

I said I said Id hold you in my heart heart heart till I can hold you in my arms
Oh darling please wait for meI memorized the note you sent
Go to all the places that we went
I seem to search the whole day through
For anything thats part of you
I kept a ribbon from your hair
A breath of perfume lingers there
It helps to cheer me when Im blue
Anything thats part of you
Oh how it hurts to miss you so
When I know you dont love me anymore
To go on needing you
Knowing you dont need me
No reason left for me to live
What can I take what can I give
When Id give all of someone new
For anything thats part of youIll have a blue Christmas without you
Ill be so blue just thinking about you
Decorations of red on a green Christmas tree
Wont be the same dear if youre not here with me
And when those blue snowflakes start falling
Thats when those blue memories start calling
Youll be doin all right with your Christmas of white
But Ill have a blue blue blue blue Christmas

Lets just be glad we had some time to spend together

People ask me how
How Ive lived til now
I tell them I dont know
I guess they understand
How lonely life has been
But life began again
The day you took my hand
And yes I know how lonely life can be
The shadows follow me
And the night wont set me free
But I dont let the evening get me down
Now that youre around me
And you love me too
Your thoughts are just for me
You set my spirit free
And Im happy that you do
The book of life is brief
And once a page is read
All but love is dead
That is my belief
And yes I know how loveless life can be
The shadows follow me
And the night wont set me free
But I dont let the evening bring me down
Now that youre around me
And I love you so

Any way you want to let it roll
Yeah yeah yeah
You got me doin what you want me
Baby what you want me to doIve had nothing but sorrow
Since you said we were through
Theres no hope for tomorrow
Hows the world treating you
Every sweet thing that mattered
Has been broken in two
All my dreams have been shattered
Hows the world treating you
Got no plans for next Sunday
Got no plans for today
Every day is blue Monday
Every day youre away
Every sweet thing that mattered
Hows the world treating you
And Im asking you darling
Hows the world treating youWhen they gave out eyes like diamonds
That would shame the stars that shine
My darlin my darlin
You were the first in line
When they gave out lips like honey
That hold a new thrill every time
My darlin my darlin
You were the first in line
There may be others
that know you longer
Who pledge their hearts to you
But theres no other
could love you stronger
Any stronger than I do
Dont refuse me say youll choose me
My darlin say Im your darlin
The first and the last in lineHow do you think I feel
I know your loves not real
The girl Im mad about is just a gadabout
How do you think I feel
How do you think we stand
I know youve made your plan
But youve included free
And thats too much for me
How do you think I feel
I wont be true again
I know that I cant win
So why should I pretend
That you still love meI gave my heart
I gave my love
Oh ho my darling
I am true
Doin the best
The best I can
But its not good enough for you
I tried so hard
So hard to please
Oh ho my darling
What more can I do
Doin the best
The best I can
But its not good enough for you
You know I was the kind whod run
Any time youd call
I guess I was the only one
Who didnt mind at all
Ill be a dreamer
Ill be a fool
Oh ho my darling
My whole life through
Doin the best
The best I can
But its not good enough for you
You know I was the kind whod run
Any time youd call
I guess I was the only one
Who didnt mind at all
Ill be a dreamer
Ill be a fool
Oh ho my darling
My whole life through
Doin the best
The best I can
But its not good enough for you
But its not good enough for youI can explain about last night
Though things didnt look just right
Please believe me there was nothing wrong
I thought about you baby all night long
Cross my heart I hope to die
Well I wouldnt tell you no lie mmm
Talk about a piece of rotten luck
You do a friend a favor and you wind up stuck
She couldnt hold a candle to you no siree
Very hard to handle like a Model T
Cross my heart I hope to die
Well I wouldnt tell you no lie
Please believe me when I say
Wild horses couldnt drag me away
From you cause I dont have to look too hard
To see what Ive got in my own back yard
So please forgive me and forget
Dont say my alloys all wet
I miss those kisses from your honeycomb
This humble bumble bee just wants to fly back home
Cross my heart I hope to die
Well I wouldnt tell you no lie
I wouldnt tell you no lie
No no no no no no
I wouldnt tell you no lieWell I quit my job down at the car wash
Left my mama a goodbye note
By sundown Id left Kingston
With my guitar under my coat
I hitchhiked all the way down to Memphis
Got a room at the YMCA
For the next three weeks I went huntin them nights
Just lookin for a place to play
Well I thought my pickin would set em on fire
But nobody wanted to hire a guitar man
Well I nearly bout starved to death down in Memphis
I run outta money and luck
So I bought me a ride down to Macon Georgia
On a overloaded poultry truck
I thumbed on down to Panama City
Started pickin out some o them all night bars
Hopin I could make myself a dollar
Makin music on my guitar
I got the same old story at them all night piers
There aint no room around here for a guitar man
We dont need a guitar man son
So I slept in the hobo jungles
Roamed a thousand miles of track
Till I found myself in Mobile Alabama
At a club they call Big Jacks
A little four-piece band was jammin
So I took my guitar and I sat in
I showed em what a band would sound like
With a swingin little guitar man
Show em son
If you ever take a trip down to the ocean
Find yourself down around Mobile
Make it on out to a club called Jacks
If you got a little time to kill
Just follow that crowd of people
Youll wind up out on his dance floor
Diggin the finest little five piece group
Up and down the Gulf of Mexico
Guess whos leadin that five-piece band
Well wouldnt ya know its that swingin little guitar manGirls on the beaches commit a sin
They dont show yards and yards of skin

Set in your old ways
Changes are a-comin
For these are changing days
And if your head is in the sand
While things are goin on
What you need what you need
What you need is a change of habit
Now if youre in the habit
To let your temper fly
When you talk with people
Who dont see eye to eye
And if you dont believe it
Theres a newer world ahead
What you need what you need
What you need is a change of habit
A change of habit a change of outlook
A change of heart youll be all right
The halls of darkness
Have doors that open
Its never too late
To see the light
So if youre in the habit
Of putting people down
Just because theyre different
From the wrong side of town
Well dont count on any medals son
Theyre pinning none on you
What you need what you need
What you need is a change of habitEarth boy dream of angel

Yo-di-o-di-o
No feminine gal wears britches

Shell put a halter through your nose
Have you cooking and washing clothes
While she goes chasing them buffaloes
Bet your boots thats a gal in britchesBack porch preacher preaching at me
Acting like he wrote the golden rules
Shaking his fist and speeching at me
Shouting from his soap box like a fool
Come Sunday morning hes lying in bed
With his eye all red with the wine in his head
Wishing he was dead when he oughta be
Heading for Sunday school
Clean up your own backyard
Oh dont you hand me none of your lines
Clean up your own backyard
You tend to your business Ill tend to mine
Drugstore cowboy criticizing
Acting like hes better than you and me
Standing on the sidewalk supervising
Telling everybody how they ought to be
Come closing time most every night
He locks up tight and out go the lights
And he ducks out of sight and he cheats on his wife
With his employee
Clean up your own backyard
Oh dont you hand me none of your lines
Clean up your own backyard
You tend to your business Ill tend to mine
Armchair quarterbacks always moanin
Second guessing people all day long
Pushing fooling and hanging on in
Always messing where they dont belong
When you get right down to the nitty-gritty
Isnt it a pity that in this big city
Not a one alittle bitty manll admit
He could have been a little bit wrong
Clean up your own backyard
Oh dont you hand me dont you hand me none of your lines
Clean up your own backyard
You tend to your business Ill tend to mine
Clean up your own backyard
You tend to your business Ill tend to mineDid you ever notice when the sun goes down
Out of nowhere comes a strange and pretty sound
Its a whistling tune for walking in the night
If you listen you can hear it in the breeze
Specially when the breeze is drifting through the trees
Its a whistling tune for walking in the night
And the murmuring waters sing the song
The echoing mountains hum along
The whispering valleys fill the air
With a whistling tune our hearts can share
Its so wonderful to walk beneath the moon
Listening to old mother natures favorite tune
Its a whistling tune for walking in the nightWell a hundred years from now I wont be crying
A hundred years from now I wont be blue
My heart will have to forget that we ever met
But I wont care a hundred years from now
Ill never forget sweetheart the night you told me
That you could Live without my love somehow
Thats all in the past I knew it wouldnt last
But I wont care a hundred years from nowAsk me if I wanted to caress you
And Id confess
Ask me if Im longing to possess you
Ill answer yes
Now that were together
I could hold you close forever
And I swear that I would never let you go
Theres no question that I care more than you
Love me darling just be mine completely
And theres nothing I wont do if you
Just ask meWhen everyone thought the world was flat
Columbus said Its round
He went down in history
And America was found
Cause
He had confidence
A little thing called confidence
Theres no job too immense when youve got
Confidence
With a see and an O and an N and an F
And an I and a D and an ENCE
Put em all together and what have you got
Confidence
Youll be surprised what you can do
If you will only try
Remember the tortoise and the hare
Who had that famous race
The speedy hare wound up nowhere
And slow poke took first place
Cause
He had confidence
A little thing called confidence
Theres no job too immense when youve got
Confidence
Youll be surprised what you can do
If you will only try
How do you know that you cant ride a rainbow in the sky
Youll be surprised what you can do
If you will only try
All you need is confidence
A little thing called confidence
Theres no job too immense when youve got
Confidence
With a see and an O and an N and an F
And an I and a D and an ENCE
Put em all together and what have you got
ConfidenceCould I fall in love for the very first time
Thats what I ask myself when youre lips touch mine
Could I fall in love on a night like tonight
Thats what Id like to know when I hold you tight
Now that were alone Now that were alone
Just a kiss apart Just a kiss apart
I have the answer from the feeling in my heart
Could I fall in love and forever be true
My heart tells me I could if I fell for youIn the twilight glow i see her
Blue eyes crying in the rain
When we kissed goodbye and parted
I knew wed never meet again
Love is like a dying ember
Only memories remain
Through the ages i remember
Blue eyes crying in the rain
Someday when we meet up yonder
Well stroll hand in hand again
In a land that knows no parting
Blue eyes crying in the rain
Blue eyes crying in the rain
Blue eyes crying in the rain
Blue eyes crying in the rainThough you are gone I still wear your ring
Theyre playing the song we used to sing
Echoes of love echoes of love
Are coming to me out of the past
The letters you wrote I treasure them so
And I hear your voice wherever I go
Echoes of love echoes of love
Are coming to me out of the past
In the rustle of a breeze in the patter of the rain
In the rushing of the seas all I hear is your name
Come back my love and once you are near
Darling I know no more will I hear
Echoes of love echoes of love
cause youll be with me right in my heart
Echoes of love echoes of love
Cause youll be with me right in my heartAny day now I will hear you say
Goodbye my love
Youll be on your way
Then my wild beautiful bird
You will have flown
Any day now Ill be all alone
Oh oh oh
Any day now when your restless eyes
Meet someone new
To my sad surprise
Then the blue shadow will fall all over town
Any day now
Love will let me down
Oh oh oh
I know I shouldnt want to keep you
If you dont want to stay yeah
Until youve gone forever
Ill be holding on for dear life
Holding you this way
Begging you to stay
Any day now
When the clock strikes go
Youll call it off
Then my tears will flow
Then the blue shadow will fall all over town
Any day now
Love will let me down
Oh oh oh
Oh any day now
Oh oh oh
Oh any day now
Dont fly away my beautiful bird
Dont fly away my beautiful birdO beautiful for spacious skies
For amber waves of grain
For purple mountain majesties
Above thy fruited plain
America America
God shed his grace on thee
And crown thy good with brotherhood
From sea to shining sea
For beautiful for spacious skies
For amber waves of grain
For purple mountain majesties
Above the fruited plain

From sea to shining seaHello misfortune hows my old friend Mr Misery
Ive been away so long I bet you think you saw the last of me
Got no bed to rest my head
No doors or walls or window pane
Now all I needed was the rain
Rain rain rain rain
Met a little honey at the Buzzin Bumble Bee Cafe
Yes I did
One drink and all my money and that honey bee had flown away
Im bout as low as I can go
I dont really mean to complain
Now all I needed was the rain
Rain rain rain rain
All I needed was this rain
All I needed was the rain um umFool fool fool
That I was to fall for you
Well fool fool fool
That I was to fall for you
Well I know what a fool I was
To think that you could love me too
Well well when I first met you baby
Well I knew I couldnt win
But I just kept right on trying
Cause trying is no sin
What a fool fool fool
That I was to fall for you
Well I know what a fool I was
To think that you could love me too
Well when I first met you baby
Well I knew I couldnt win
But I just kept right on trying
Cause trying is no sinDont leave me now
Now that I need you
How blue and lonely Id be
If you should say were through
Dont break my heart
This heart that loves you
Theyll just be nothing for me
If you should leave me now
What good is dreamin
If I must dream all alone by myself
Without you darling
My arms would gather dust
Come to these arms
These arms that need you
Dont close your eyes to my plea
Dont leave me nowHearts made of stone will never brake
Cause your love is never there they just dont care
You can ask and plea please please please work
And all your love is there to stay
These hearts of stone will cause you pain
Although you love there has stopped just the same

Come running to me
I need somebody to lean on
Im tired of being unhappy and so blue
If she came I would hold her cause I need that shoulder
To lean on yes I really do
I need somebody and maybe that somebody is youI walk along a thin line darling
Dark shadows follow me
Heres where lifes dream lies disillusioned
The edge of reality
Oh I can hear strange voices echo
Laughing with mockery
The border line of doom Im facing
The edge of reality
On the edge of reality she sits there tormenting me
The girl with the nameless face
On the edge of reality where she overpowers me
With fears that I cant explain
She drove me to the point of madness
The brink of misery
If shes not real then Im condemned to
The edge of reality
On the edge of reality she sits there tormenting me
The girl with the nameless face
On the edge of reality where she overpowers me
With fears that I cant explain
She drove me to the point of madness
The brink of misery
If shes not real then Im condemned to
The edge of realityWith eyes that hide the man within
You see behind the eyes of other men
Youve lived and died and come to life again
And now you standin alone at the crossroads of your mind
Youve left your yesterdays behind
But which road leads you to tomorrow
Charro
Youve turned your back on yesterday
Betrayed a man who swore hed make you pay
For when you left you took his pride away
You know hell never let you break away so easily
Youll have to fight before youre free
But how much more time can you borrow
Charro
Now in a single moment your past grows dim
One thought goes racing across your mind
You ride to meet the woman you stole from him
Oh no Charro dont go
Charro dont go
Theres something hanging in the wind
Your past is catching up and closing in
Youve been halfway to hell and back again
And now you laugh in the devils face with your last breath
Youll run a race with life and death
But will you live to see tomorrow
CharroOn the hills of Georgia
Across the plains of Tennessee
Ive seen and Ive done most everything
That a man can do or see
But if I could only borrow one dream from yesterday
Id be on that train tomorrow
Ill be home on Christmas day
And so many times before
She left that candle burning
Oh too many tears have fell
My soul filled with yearning
If I had any sense at all
Id just be on my way
Id be on that train tomorrow
Be home on Christmas day
Every time I think about her
All the love I left behind
Memories still linger in my troubled mind
I could set aside my pride
And Id be on my way
Id catch that train tomorrow
And be home on Christmas day
If I had any sense at all
Id just be on my way
Id catch that train tomorrow
Id be home on Christmas day
I said Id catch that train tomorrow
Id be home on Christmas dayHow can you lose what you never had
I tell myself when Im feeling sad
You dont have the right to cry
You believed your own lie
Its your fault because
You thought that she was yours
Think it over once think it over twice
I wish I could take my own advice
I know I should be glad why does it hurt so bad
How can you lose what you never had
You dont have the right to cry
You believed your own lie
Its your fault because
You thought that she was yours
Think it over once think it over twice
I wish I could take my own advice
I know I should be glad why does it hurt so bad
How can you lose what you never had
How can you lose what you never hadIm beginning to forget you
That old heartache is gone
Im beginning to sleep at night
No more crying till dawn
I can hear your name mentioned
And it brings no misery
Im beginnin to forget you
Like you forgot me
Im beginning to smile again
After crying for so long
I can hear the tune we loved so well
And its just another song
Im so happy that its over
Im so thankful to be free
Im beginnin to forget you
Like you forgot meIf I can never see you if I can never hold you
If I can never touch your face or feel your warm embrace
I still remember talkin I still remember laughin
I still remember lovin a lot yes touchin you babe Ive not forgot
And everythings bringin it back youre only just bringin it back
A familiar place for a familiar face just brings it all back
And everythings bringin it back good songs bringin it back
Even after so much time you know everythings bringin it back
Thinkin in my solitude wonderin about your attitude
Thinkin maybe that your love has died there it is I can see it in your eyes
And a look of sweet surrender but a touch of too much sadness
Cause Ive hurt you so you know your sorrow shows
And you just cant stay oh but you cant let go
Cause everythings bringin it back youre only just bringin it back
A familiar place for a familiar face just brings it all back
And everythings bringin it back good songs bringin it back
And even after so much time you know everythings bringin it backOh yes I know its true
The more you fall in love
The more your heart can break in two
Now that youve said goodbye
For every tender kiss
Ive had the tears I cry
I gave my heart and soul
All the love I knew
Oh how much it hurts me now
To know that we are through
Ill always feel this way
My arms will be so empty
Youll return some day and say
Your love yes your big love
Will be here to stay

Flying across the desert in a twa
I saw a woman walking across the sand
She been a walkin thirty miles en route to Bombay
To get a brown eyed handsome man
Her destination was a brown eyed handsome man
Way back in history three thousand years
Back every since the world began
Theres been a whole lot of good women shed a tear
For a brown eyed handsome man
Thats what the trouble was brown eyed handsome man
Beautiful daughter couldnt make up her mind
Between a doctor and a lawyer man
Her mother told her daughter go out and find yourself
A brown eyed handsome man
Thats what your daddy is a brown eyed handsome man
Milo venus was a beautiful lass
She had the world in the palm of her hand
But she lost both her arms in a wrestling match
To get brown eyed handsome man
She fought and won herself a brown eyed handsome man
Two three count with nobody on
He hit a high fly into the stand
Rounding third he was headed for home
It was a brown eyed handsome man
That won the game it was a brown eyed handsome manFor the millionth and the last time

One more kiss and then I promise

Walking barefoot by the stream
Come on to me Your hairs softly falling
On my face as in a dream
And the time will be our time
And the grass wont pay no mind
Saying nothing lying where the sun is
Baking down upon our sides
My lips touch you with their soft wet kisses
Your hands gentle in reply
And the time will be our time
And the grass wont pay no mind
Child touch my soul with your cries
And the music will know what weve found
I hear a hundred good-byes
But today I hear only one sound
The moment were living is now
Now now now now now now now
Young bird flying and a soft wind blowing
Cools the sweat inside my palms
Close my eyes hear the flowers growing
As you lay sleeping in my arms
And the time will be our time
And the grass wont pay no mind
No the grass wont pay no mindI dont want to I dont want to
I dont want to let you know how much I want you
Dont come near me I dont trust you
I dont trust the way you thrill me when I touch you

And do the things that please me
I dont want to get tied down with a girl like you
I dont want to love you but I do
I was happy free and easy I could go around
And do the things that please me

Humming like a fountain swinging out on Smokey mountain

Cause when I kick my shoes off and I kick my blues off
With a barefoot ballad you just cant go wrong

With a dollar in my hand
And an aching in my heart
And my pockets full of sand
Im a long ways from home
And I missed my loved one so
In the early mornin rain
With no place to go
Out on runway number nine
Big seven hundred and seven set to go
Well Im out here on the grass
Where the pavement never grows
Where the liquor tasted good
And the women all were fast
There she goes my friend
Shes rolling out at last
Hear the mighty engines roar
Hear the mighty engines roar
See the silver wing on high
See the silver wing on high
Shes away and westward bound
For above the clouds she flies
Where the mornin rain dont fall
And the sun always shines
Shell be flying over my home
In about three hours time
This ol airports got me down
Its no earthly good to me
Cause Im stuck here on the ground
Cold and drunk as I might be
Cant jump a jet plane
Cant jump a plane
Like you can a freight train
Like a freight train
So I best be on my way
In the early mornin rain
So I best be on my way
In the early mornin rain
So I best be on my way
In the early mornin rainI saw the harbor lights
They only told me we were parting
Those same old harbor lights
That once brought you to me
I watched the harbor lights
How could I help it
Tears were starting
Good-bye to golden nights
Beside the silvery seas
I long to hold you dear
And kiss you just once more
But you were on the ship
And I was on the shore
Now I know lonely nights
For all the while my heart keeps praying
That someday harbor lights
Will bring you back to meFame and fortune
How empty they can be
But when I hold you in my arms
Thats heaven to me
Who cares for fame and fortune
Theyre only passing things
But the touch of your lips on mine
Makes me feel like a king
Your kind of love
Is a treasure I hold
Its so much greater
Than silver or gold
I know that I have nothing
If you should go away
But to know that you love me
Brings fame and fortune my wayIll take you home again kathleen thomas p westendorf

And were in a world of our own
Holding you close is heaven
Only I know what its worth
Knowing youre mine forever

When were in a world of our ownWhen a boy like me meets a girl like you
Then I must believe wishes come true
I just look at you and I touch your hand
And this ordinary world becomes a wonderland

There would be this magic moment
One to last a lifetime through

I hear Christmas bells
The gentle snow keeps falling down on people
Who are homeward bound
Thats the its always been
The circle never really ends
Christmas seems to come and go
Homes a the place that I dont know
Holly leaves and Christmas trees
Its that time of year
Lights aglow and mistletoe
Dont mean a thing when youre not here
As I walk walk this lonely street
The sound of snow beneath my feet
Ill think of how of how it used to be
Holly leaves and Christmas trees
Use to mean so much to meNow that the truth is hard to face
I cant forget you once were mine
Someone else is in my place
Whenever we meet my heart beats out of time
Just a little bit of green
Clouds my eyes to what Ive seen
Just a little bit of green
When I see you with someone new
And knowing that theres nothing I can do
Please dont try to tie me down
Those are the words you often say
I cant help seeing you around
You smile with surprise I turn my eyes away
Just a little bit of green
Oh-oh-ho clouds my eyes to what Ive seen
Just a little bit of green
When I see you with someone new
And knowing that theres nothing I can do
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Just a little bit of green
Oh-oh-ho clouds my eyes to what Ive seen
Just a little bit of green
When I see you with someone new
And knowing that theres nothing I can do
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Just a little bit of greenEasy come easy go

It will never do anyhow
When your roosters a crowing at the break of dawn
Look out your window and Ill be gone
Youre the reason why Im traveling on
But dont think twice its all right
An it aint no use in turning on your light baby
The light I never knowed
An it aint no use in turning on your light baby
Im on the dark side of the road
But I wish there was something I could do or say
To try and make you change your mind and stay
We never did too much talking anyway
But dont think twice its all right
Well it aint no use in calling out my name gal
Like you never done before
It aint no use in calling out my name gal
I cant hear you anymore
Im a thinking and a wondering walking down the road
I once loved a woman a child Im told
I give her my heart but she wanted my soul
But dont think twice its all right
So long honey baby
Where Im bound I cannot tell
But goodbyes too good a word gal
So Ill just kinda say Fare thee well
Now Im not saying that you treated me unkind
You could have done a lot better but I dont mind
You just kinda wasted my precious time
But dont think twice its all rightHere comes Santa Claus here comes Santa Claus
Right down Santa Claus lane
Vixen Blitzen all his reindeer
Pulling on the reins
Bells are ringing children singing
All is merry and bright
Hang your stockings and say a prayer
Cause Santa Claus comes tonight
Here comes Santa Claus here comes Santa Claus
Riding down Santa Claus lane
Hes got a bag thats filled with toys
For boys and girls again
Hear those sleigh bells jingle jangle
What a beautiful sight
Jump in bed and cover up your head
Because Santa Claus comes tonight
Here comes Santa Claus here comes Santa Claus
Right down Santa Claus lane
He doesnt care if youre a rich or poor boy
He loves you just the same
Santa knows that were Gods children
That makes everything right
Fill your hears with Christmas cheer
Cause Santa Claus comes tonight
Well here comes Santa Claus here comes Santa Claus
Riding down Santa Claus lane

Too soon the sunrise will wake her from her sleep
So until tomorrow sleep Hawaii sleepIll be home for Christmas

If only in my dreams
Ill be home for ChristmasEvery man has a black star
A black star over his shoulder
And when a man sees his black star
He knows his time his time has come
Black star dont shine on me black star
Black star keep behind me black star
Theres a lot of livin I gotta do
Give me time to make a few dreams come true
Black star
When I ride I feel that black star
That black star over my shoulder
So I ride in front of that black star
Never lookin around never lookin around
Black star dont shine on me black star
Black star keep behind me black star
Theres a lot of livin I gotta do
Give me time to make a few dreams come true
Black star
One fine day Ill see that black star
That black star over my shoulder
And when I see that old black star
Ill know my time my time has come
Black star dont shine on me black star
Black star keep behind me black star
Theres a lot of livin I gotta do
Give me time to make a few dreams come true
Black starWe almost shared a dream
We almost made it as a team
How nice it would have been
We almost touched the stars
And there stood heaven almost ours
We were just outsiders looking in
We had the chance to fall
But fate stepped in to end it all
Before it could begin
And if its true youre really going
Theres nothing but goodbye to say
The saddest part of all is knowing
We almost went all the wayI am yours and you are mine come what may
Love like ours remains divine come what may
Even though were miles apart
Youre living in my lonely heart
At night the teardrops start and pour the long long day
I keep your picture near me since you went away
I plant a kiss upon your lips each night and day
Bear in mind and you will find a heart that is true
And Ill be here with you come what may
All right
I keep your picture near me since you went away
I plant a kiss upon your lips each night and day
Bear in mind and you will find a heart that is true
And Ill be here with you come what may
And Ill be here with you come what may
And Ill be here with you come what may
Ah um bop a bop a um bop a bop a come what mayDont ever take tour eyes off me
Not even for a minute
Cause like a panther I might pounce
And that will be the limit
I can be sneaky fast as a snake
I strike like a cobra make no mistake
And baby youll be trapped quick as a wink
Its animal instinct
Dont think that I wont pin you down
No matter how you plead it
Im like a lion whos been caged
And you are gonna meet it
Watch out Ill warn ya sharp as a hawk
Im wild as a tiger I prowl and I stalk
cause when a man feels thirst he takes a drink
Its animal instinctThere were five sleepyheads
All tucked into their beds
While I sang a lullaby
One got dream dust in her eye
There were four sleepyheads
Playing possum with me
Mr Sandman came by
And then there were three
Moonbeams play peek-a-boo
Three away became two
And my song was almost done
When the land of Nod took one
Kissed the last one goodnight
Then I heard not a peep
There were five sleepyheads
Now theyre all fast asleepThats what you get for loving me
Thats what you get for loving me
Everything we had is gone you can see
Thats what you get for loving me
Now dont you shed a tear for me
I aint the love you thought Id be
Ive had a hundred just like you
But dont be blue Ill have a thousand before Im through
Thats what you get for loving me
Thats what you get for loving me
Everything we had is gone you can see
Thats what you get for loving me
Now there you go youre cryin again
You should have known how things would end
But then some day when your poor heart is on the mend
I just might pass this way againI was the one who taught her to kiss
The way that she kisses you now
And you know the way she touches your cheek
Well I taught her how
I was the one who taught her to cry
When she wants you under her spell
The sight of her tears drives you out of your mind
I taught her so well
And then one day
I had my love as perfect as could be
She lived she loved she laughed she cried
And it was all for me
Ill never know who taught her to lie
Now that its over and done
Who learned the lesson when she broke my heart
I was the one
And then one day
I had my love as perfect as could be
She lived she loved she laughed she cried
And it was all for me
Ill never know who taught her to lie
Now that its over and done
Who learned the lesson when she broke my heart
I was the oneNo-ones in a hurry
No-one seems to worry
Why theyre all so happy is very clear
Every day siesta every night fiesta
I think Im gonna like it here
All this lovely scenery
Theres more to it than greenery
I know a chance for romance is always near
Mission bells are ringing everybodys singing
I think Im gonna like it hear
The sound of laughter from every doorway
Sweet music floating across the square
It seems to say things are going better
Your troubles like bubbles will soon disappear in the air
Down to my last peso but Im not afraid to say so
I feel just like a brave Spanish cavalier
I dont care where we go so lead on mi amigo
I think Im gonna like it hereOne thought of you
My heart begins churning
I feel return
To a fountain of love
My lips and eyes
They ache to be near you
To hold you here
In my fountain of love
Never be blue
Should your world start sinking
Just come and drink
From my fountain of love
Well build a new world off
On a high mountain
Well live
On our fountain of loveDrums of the islands youre beating in my heart
Youre with me no matter where I roam
If ever I wander if ever were apart
I know that you will lead me home
If I should journey across the deep blue sea
Ill never forget these coral shores
Drums of the islands I hear you calling me
And Ill return forever yours
I love each valley each grain of sand each hill
The flowers the music of the isles
These are the things I love and always will
Though I may roam ten thousand milesIll go on loving you
Dont ask me why
Dont know what else to do
Dont ask me why
How sad my heart would be
If you should go
Though youre not good for me
I want you so
Its not the kind
Of love I dream about
But its the kind
That I cant live without
Youre all Im longing for
Dont say good-bye
I need you more and more
Dont ask me why
I need you more and more
Dont ask me whyAm I ready can my heart be true
Am I ready to fall in love with you
One love one girlone dream shared by two

In a house that has everything everything but love
Crystal chandeliers chauffeured limousines
Yes youll really have everything everything but love
I see diamonds sables sapphires and pearls
And as the picture clears
Poor little rich girl sitting all alone
Counting her treasures in tears
Better just a shack where two people care
Than a house that has everything everything but love
I see diamonds sables sapphires and pearls
And as the picture clears
Poor little rich girl sitting all alone
Counting her treasures in tears
Better just a shack where two people care
Than a house that has everything everything but love
Than a house that has everything everything but loveTake the ribbon from your hair
Shake it loose and let it fall
Layin soft upon my skin
Like the shadows on the wall
Come and lay down by my side
Till the early mornin light
All Im takin is your time
Help me make it through the night
I dont care whos right or wrong
I dont try to understand
Let the devil take tomorrow
Lord tonight I need a friend
Yesterday is dead and gone
And tomorrows out of sight
And its sad to be aloneAs I read the letters that you wrote to me
Well its you its you that Im thinking of
As I read the lines that to me were so sweet
I remember our faded love
I miss you darlin more and more everyday
As heaven would miss the stars above
With every heartbeat I still think of you
And remember our faded love
As I think of the past all the pleasures that we had
As I watch the mating of the doves
It was in the springtime that you said goodbye
I remember our faded love
I miss you darlin more and more everyday
As heaven would miss the stars above
With every heartbeat I still think of you
And remember our faded loveWhen I was little my mama said to me
One day youll find a love to last eternally
I want you with me everywhere I go
So please dont leave me baby I love you so
Ill be the ruler of this whole wide world
If you will only say youll be my girl
I want you with me in everything I do
You know I need you baby Im in love with you
There is no mountain that I cant climb
You find the mountain child and Ill find the time
I want you with me with me night and day
Well you can make me happy baby dont you go away
Ill swim an ocean with a raging foam
If I know that youll be there when I come back home
I want you with me you know I love you so
Well I want you with me baby Ill never let you go
Well I want you with me baby Ill never let you goAre you sincere when you say I love you

Oh and are you really mine every day all the time
Ive gotta know which way to go
Will our love grow are you sincere
Are you sincere when you say I love you
Honey are you sincere when you say you love me too
And are you really mine every day all the time
Ive gotta know which way to go
Will our love grow are you sincereDatin is a game that grown-ups play
Datin means acting in a silly way
Datin makes girls start wiggle walking
Datin makes a guy start baby talking
Dizzy like children on a merry-go-round
Grown-ups are the biggest kids Ive found
Youd think they belong in a baby carriage
Theyre doing things that lead to marriage
But dont you laugh at what they do oh no
Cause some day youll be datin too
Datin makes a guy comb his hair just right
His girl can mess it up when they kiss good-night
Datin makes you quarrel and say youll break up
And just because its so much fun to make up
Children cant wait to grow up but then
Theyre datin and theyre acting like kids again
Youd think they belong in a baby carriage
Theyre doing things that lead to marriage
But dont you laugh at what they do oh no
Some day youll be datin tooStill I recall all the good times together
The love we shared the fun and the laughter
How I wish you could feel what my heart says tonight dear
I miss you and I wish you were here
Dreams that I had they lay broken in sorrow
The plans I made the hopes for tomorrow
If I could I would tell you Im lonesome tonight dear
Oh I miss you and I wish you were here
All through the night I will see memories passing
The way you looked the sound of your laughing
How I long for the touch of your hand holding mine dear
Oh I miss you and I wish you were here
Lord I miss you and I wish you were hereHow would you like to be
A little circus clown
And you could wear a smile
Instead of a frown
How would you like to be
A little kangaroo
A-hoppin up and down
And I could hop with you
Come on and smile a little smile a little
Hop a little hop a little
Smile a little hop a little bit with me
Come on and smile a little smile a little
Hop a little hop a little
Smile a little hop a little bit with me
How would you like to be
A little buzzing bee
And instead of a tree
You could buzz around me
How would you like to be
A little mocking bird
And you can sing me songs
Like I never heard
Come on and buzz a little buzz a little
Sing a little sing a little
Buzz a little sing a little bit with me
Buzz buzz buzz a little
Do re mi a little
Buzz a little sing a little bit with me
How would you like to be
A little baby bear
And you can hug me tight
Any time you care
How would you like to be
A little dancing doll
And you could dance with me
Everytime I callFrom a jack to a king of loneliness to a wedding ring
Ive played a ace and I won the queen
I walked away with your heart
From a jack to a king
With no regrets I stacked I stacked the cards I stacked the cards last night
And lady luck played her hand just right
You made me king of your heart
Oh for just a little while I thought that I might lose the game
Oh but just in time I saw that twinkle in your eyes
From a jack to a king of loneliness to a wedding wedding wedding ring
I played an ace and I won the queen
You made me king of your heart
For just a little while I thought that I might lose the game
Oh but just in time I saw I saw that twinkle in your eyes
From a jack to a king from loneliness to a wedding wedding wedding ring
I played an ace and I won the queen
You made me king of your heartIf you found someone new who means more than me to you
Id never stand in your way
If you feel we must part dont let pity rule your heart
Ill never stand in your way
I love you much too much to ever lose you
But what is to be will be and ill obey
Ill be blue when you go but ill never let it show
Id never stand in your way
I loved you much too much to ever lose you
But what is to be will be and ill obey
Ill be blue when you go but ill never let it show
Id never stand in your wayDo you or dont you love me
Such an easy question
Why cant I get an answer
Tell me will you or wont you need me
Such an easy question
Why cant I get an answer
All you do is give a sigh
And beat around the bush
Can it be that youre too shy
To give yourself a little old push
Can you or cant you tell me yes
Its such an easy question
Why cant I get an answerEarth angel earth angel
Will you be mine
My darling dear
Love you all the time
Im just a fool
A fool in love with you
Earth angel earth angel
The one I adore
Love you forever and ever more

My darling dear

Im just a fool
A fool in love with youWell down in New Orleans at the Golden Goose
I grabbed a green-eyed dolly that was on the loose
Well I dig that music well she said me too
I said pretty baby come on and lets do
The Dixieland Rock
Well the Dixieland Rock
Let your hair down Sugar--shake it free
And do the Dixieland Rock with me
With the blue light shining on her swinging hips
She got the drummer so nervous that he lost his sticks
The cornet player hit a note thats flat
The tromboner hit him while the poor cat sat
The Dixieland Rock
Well the Dixieland Rock
Let your hair down Sugar--shake it free
And do the Dixieland rock with me
I was all pooped out and when the clock struck four
But she said no daddy cant leave the floor
She wore a clinging dress that fit so tight
She couldnt sit down so we danced all night
The Dixieland Rock
Well the Dixieland Rock
Let your hair down Sugar--shake it free
And do the Dixieland Rock with me
Let your hair down Sugar--shake it
And do the Dixieland Rock with meFirst time I fell in love
I fell in love with you
First time I dared to dream
My only dream came true
Must be beginners luck
To wish upon a star
That opened up my eyes
And there you are
I wave no magic wand
I own no lucky charms
How then can I explain
An angel in my arms
Must be beginners luck
What else can it be
When someone wonderful as you
Loves meCowboy cowboy marry me

With a cane and a high starched collarOh you can take a whole lot of sand
And build a castle on the beach
And though you mold it and you plan
Still you got nothing in your reach
One little slip and it tumbles down
One wrong step and it crumbles all around
Like a house without love thats sure to fall apart
A house of sand is an empty work of art
You can build a tower of clay
But if you ask my advice
Well it is worthless as I say
I got no heart its cold as ice
One little slip and it tumbles down
One wrong step and it crumbles all around
Like a house without love thats sure to fall apart
A house of sand is an empty work of artAs you travel along on the Jericho Road
I would take young Johnny Cash to do this
Does the road seem all long and heavy your load
Just take it to Christ your sins all confess
On the Jericho Road your heart He will bless
On the Jericho RoadLa la la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la la la
Well I know if Id arrived in time to know you
Youd have taken the time to show me
I wouldnt be lonely
Where will I go who will I have to lie beside me
Is it something thats inside me
Im so lonely
Tried so hard each time each time I just cant make it
Feelin fast vibrations and I just cant take it
Living from day to day chasing the dream
Im Im leavin
La la la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la la la
Tried so hard each time each time I just cant make it
Feelin fast vibrations and I just cant take it
Living from day to day chasing the dream

Im almost in love tonight
When we are close my heart says surrender
Im almost in love tonight
And here under the spell of evening
I long to hold you tight
Heaven is near why think of tomorrow
Im almost in love tonight
It may be just the spell of evening
I long to hold you tight
Heaven is near why think of tomorrow
Im almost in love tonight
Almost in loveHot dog you say youre really coming back
Hot dog Im waiting at the railway track
Hot dog you say youre coming home for good
Hot dog Im going to keep knocking on wood
And baby I can hardly wait
Im gonna meet you at the gate hot dog
I fell in love with you and then you went away
But now youre coming home to stay
Hot dog soon everything will be all right
Hot dog were gonna have a ball tonight
Ive got a pocketful of dimes
Its gonna be just like old times hot dog
You went away and every day was misery
But now youre coming back to me
Hot dog my heart is gonna go insane
Hot dog when you come walking off the train
Oh how lonely I have been
But when that Santa Fe pulls in
Hot dog baby baby hot dogHear that old train whistle
Howling in the night
If that flyers southbound
Everything will be all right
Im leaving now leaving now leaving now
Im gonna get back home somehow
Dont nobody tell me
Babys been untrue
If shes been unfaithful
I dont know what Ill do
Im leaving now leaving now leaving now
Im gonna get back home somehow
Never thought that I could miss her so
I never thought I could now I know
The sound of the old train whistle
Makes me want to cry
Reminds me of that lonely feeling
When I said goodbye
Im leaving now leaving now leaving now
Im gonna get back home somehowI need Jesus to guide me every day
As Im travellin along this rough and narrow way
Though afflictions fill my soul
Im determined to make the goal
Ive gotta have Jesus cause I just cant make it by myself
Every day I pray pray pray pray
Pray pray pray pray
I pray pray pray pray
Pray pray pray
Pray and ask the Lord Jesus
Dont leave me by myself
Every mornin through the years I pray
You know Ive got to have Jesus
I just cant it by myself
By myselfI want my share of love it might as well be known
But I aint thinking of one girl to love alone
That aint the way its gonna be Im on my own and I am free
And Ive been satisfied so I dont wanna be tied
Somebodys loving arms can sure be sweet Ive found
But I want no-ones arms to ever hold me down
Once I get caught inside a net Im gonna run I bet
Im gonna run and hide I dont wanna be tied
Ive seen lovers who were matched they thought that love could stay
Once they cared and got attached it seems that love just slipped away
Dont want no claims on me
Dont want no chains that bind
As anyone could see
I say whats on my mind
Well there aint nothing I conceal Im gonna play the field
The field of love is wide
I dont wanna be tied
The field of love is wide
I dont wanna be tied
The field of love is wide
I dont wanna be tied
I said I dont I dont wanna be I dont wanna be tiedWish I was an apple dangling from a tree
Every time youd pass me by youd take a bite of me
I wish I was a bluebird Id never fly away
Id sit up on your shoulder baby and sing to you all day

Your fickle world

For it finally happened
Ive met her today
I used to think I just couldnt live
A day without you
In spite of the thousand doubts and tears
That you put me through
All at once I dont care as much for you
Im sorry to say
For now theres another
I met her today
How I treasured each smile each kiss
You gave to me now and then
Well you neednt be kind to me now
Oh no not ever againDo you know who I am
Have you have any idea who I am
Yes its been quite a while
And its so good to see you again
Its so dark in this place
That I cant see your face
May believe Oh I see
Does he know who I am
And what once was between you and me
Do you know how I tried
Have you any idea how I tried
Not to keep you in sight
Do you know darling how much I cried
I remember you said
That you had to forget about me and be free
Do you know who I am or have you forgot about me
Do you think theres a chance
You and I could start over again
Is there a prayer you still pray
Or has it just been too long and were through
Well what about you and him
Oh hes only a friend
Well I see theres still a chance for me
Well maybe some other time in some other place
With our love in your heart and a smile on your face
You will know who I am
When that time comes youll know who I am
You will know who I am
When that time comes youll know who I am
You will know who I am
When that time comes youll know who I amI look at you and wham Im head over heels
I guess that love is a banana peel
I feel so bad and yet Im feeling so well
I slipped I stumbled I fell
One crazy kiss and bam I head for the skies
I guess that love is like a cake of ice
You skate along but then you can never tell
I slipped I stumbled I fell
I never thought Id get tricked
By you sweet talking lies
Youve got a bag of tricks
And when you get busy
I got dazzled and dizzy
I fell like a ton of bricks
My knees are weak my head is spinning around
I guess that love has turned me upside down
Thought Id get hurt but gee its turning out well
I slipped I stumbled I fellAll en el rancho grande
All donde vva
Habl una rancherita
Que alegre me deca
Que alegre me deca
Te voy hacer unas calzones
comos los que esa el ranchero
Los comenzo de lana
Y los acabo de hierroIll take you home again Kathleen
Across the ocean wild and wide
To where your heart has ever been
Since first you were my bonny bride
The roses all have left your cheek
I watch them fade away and die
Your voice is soft when ere you speak
And tears bedim your lovely eyes
Oh I will take you home Kathleen
To where your heart shall feel no pain
And when the fields are soft and green
I will take you to your home KathleenI found my thrill on blueberry hill
On blueberry hill when I found you
The moon stood still on blueberry hill
And lingered until my dreams came true
The wind in the willow played
Loves sweet melody

Im a poor hawaiian beach boy
A long way from the beach
cause someone shoved his face against my hand
Now Im a kissing cousin to a ripe pineapple
Im in the can
I was minding my own business
But drinking daddys juice
I swear Ill never touch that stuff again
Just like a pig before he gave his all that aluhau
Im in the pen
Got those beach boy blues
Dont the time go slow
Lonely beach boy blues
Only thirty days and ninety years to go
I want a taste of honey
From my wahinis lips
I want to be her ever loving man

Youre not the way you seemed
You look like an angel
Walk like an angel
Talk like an angel
But I got wise
Youre the devil in disguise
Oh yes you are
The devil in disguise
I thought that I was in heaven
But I was sure surprised
Heaven help me I didnt see

But I got wise
Youre the devil in disguise
Oh yes you are

Cause he was telling everyone in town
About the love that he just found
And Maries the name of his latest flame
He talked and talked and I heard him say
That she had the longest blackest hair
The prettiest green eyes anywhere
And Maries the name of his latest flame
Though I smiled the tears inside were a-burning
I wished him luck and then he said goodbye
He was gone but still his words kept returning
What else was there for me to do but cry
Would you believe that yesterday
This girl was in my arms and swore to me
Shed be mine eternally
And Maries the name of his latest flame
Though I smiled the tears inside were a-burning
I wished him luck and then he said goodbye
He was gone but still his words kept returning
What else was there for me to do but cry
Would you believe that yesterday
This girl was in my arms and swore to me
Shed be mine eternally
And Maries the name of his latest flame
And Maries the name of his latest flame
And Maries the name of his latest flameLet the stars fade and fall
And I wont care at all
As long as I have you
Every kiss brings a thrill
And I know that it will
As long as I have you
Lets think of the future
Forget the past
Youre not my first love
But youre my last
Take the love that I bring

Every time I think that I have finally got it made
Some losing cards are played I just cant make the grade
Chorus Well I went to the bayou just last night
There was no moon but the stars were bright
Put a big long hook on a big long pole
And I pulled Mr Crawfish out of his hole
Crawfish
See I got him see the size
Stripped and cleaned before your eyes
Sweet meat look fresh and ready to cook
Crawfish
Now take Mr Crawfish in your hand
Hes gonna look good in your frying pan
If you fry him crisp or you boil him right
Hell be sweeter than sugar when you take a bite

I thought I knew the score
Now youve treated me so wrong
I cant take any more
And it looks like Im never gonna fall in love again
Fall in love Im never gonna fall in love
I mean it I mean it fall in love again
I gave my heart so easily cast aside my pride
When I saw you in his arms baby
I broke up and cried
And it looks like Im never gonna fall in love again
Thats what Im sayin Fall in love No Im never gonna fall in love
Please dont make me fall in love againI was always baby I was always
Well almost always true to you
Met a pretty mademoiselle
Her papa owned a small hotel
Oh I was almost always true to you
I resisted tho my arm was twisted
I was almost always true to you
Stayed away from drinkin wine
Thought about you all the time
Oh I was almost always true to you
Kept refusin dont jump to conclusions
I was almost always true to you
I would never grab like this
I would never steal a kiss
Oh I was almost always true to youNever found a four leaf clover to bring good luck to me
No rabbits foot no lucky star no magic wishing tree
But I got lucky yes I got lucky
When I found you oh yeah
Got no rainbow around my shoulder no horseshoe on my door
But I got you to hold me tight and who could ask for more
Oh I got lucky yes I got lucky
When I found you
I always walk around with all my fingers crossed
Im afraid the love I found just might get lost
So wont you tell me that you love me hurry up and name the day
And then Ill know that my good luck is really here to stay
Oh I got lucky yes I got lucky
When I found you
I always walk around with all my fingers crossed
Im afraid the love I found just might get lost
So wont you tell me that you love me hurry up and name the day
And then Ill know that my good luck is really here to stay
Oh I got lucky yes I got lucky
When I found you
Oh I got lucky yes I got lucky
When I found youIts knowin that your door is always open
And your path is free to walk
That makes me tend to leave my sleepin bag
Rolled up and stashed behind your couch
And its knowin Im not shackled
By forgotten words and bonds
And the ink stains that have dried upon some line
That keeps you in the back roads
By the rivers of my memory
That keeps you ever gentle on my mind
Its not clingin to the rocks and ivy
Planted on their columns now that bind me
Or something that somebody said because
They thought we fit together walkin
Its just knowing that the world
Will not be cursing or forgiving
When I walk along some railroad track and find
That youre movin on the back roads
By the rivers of my memory
And for hours youre just gentle on my mind
Though the wheat fields and the clothes lines
And the junkyards and the highways come between us
And some other womans cryin to her mother
Cause she turned and I was gone
I still might run in silence
Tears of joy might stain my face
And the summer sun might burn me till Im blind
But not to where I cannot see
You walkin on the back roads
By the rivers flowin gentle on my mind
I dip my cup of soup back from a gurglin cracklin cauldron
In some train yard
My beard a rustlin coal pile
And a dirty hat pulled low across my face
Through cupped hands round a tin can
I pretend to hold you to my breast and find
That youre waitin from the back roads
By the rivers of my memory
Ever smilin ever gentle on my mindIm with a crowd but oh so alone
I still have the picture you sent me
And you signed it with love you recall
And the one of me that you wanted
Is now hanging face to the wall
At night Im never alone
Im afraid that Ill weaken and phone
And Im afraid that you will be gone
Im with a crowd but oh so aloneToday I passed you on the street
And my heart was at your feet
I cant help it if Im still in love with you
Somebody else stood by your side
And he looked so satisfied
I cant help it if Im still in love with you
A memory from the past came slowly stealing
As I braced your arm and walked so close to you yeah
Oh heaven only knows how much I miss you
I cant help it if Im still in love with you
I cant help it if Im still in love with youI thank the Lord for everything
When things are going my way
He said to me I will comfort thee
And drive your cares away
He promised me I will walk thee
And drive your cares away
I did not ask for riches
He gave me wealth untold
The moon the stars the sun the sky
Are there for you to behold
I thank the lord for everything
And I count my blessings each day
He came to me when I needed Him
I only have to pray
And Hell come to you if you ask Him to
Hes only a prayer awayI told her to leave me alone
Thats what shes done just what shes done
And a house built for two aint a home
When its lived in by one one lonely one
And I can no longer hear footsteps come right down the hall
Here come the teardrops bitter they are harder they fall
She caught me lying then she caught a train
And I caught a fever walking home in the rain
Oh yeah
But its over and Im done
She left me once and for all
Here come the teardrops bitter they are harder they fall
Here come the teardrops bitter they are harder they fallIn a little while youre leavin
Starting on the journey home
Soon Ill be alone the one who loves you
La la la la la somewhere in the heart of Rome
Ill make a wish in every fountain
Say a prayer that youll return
Minutes Ill be counting
May the fire of love still burn
Ill keep your picture by my pillow
And pretend Im not alone
Make believe that you are with me
La la la la la in the heart of Rome
Suddenly the tears are falling
As we hear the whistle blow
Hold me very close before you leave me
La la la la la somewhere in the heart of Rome
Ill make a wish in every fountain
Say a prayer that youll return
Minutes Ill be counting
May the fire of love still burn
Ill keep your picture by my pillow
And pretend Im not alone
Make believe that you are with me
La la la la la in the heart of RomeHappy ending happy ending
Give me a story with a happy ending
When boy meets girl and then
They never part again
But live forever happily like you and me
Our love story gets me so upset
Like romeo and juliet
Im not smart enough to figure why
Some folks enjoy a real good cry
Happy ending happy ending
Give me a story with a happy ending
When boy meets girl and then
They never part again
But live forever happily like you and me
Never thought that i would stand a chance
That youd give me a second glance
But i think that you can play the part
And give a guy a happy heart
Happy ending happy ending
Give me a story with a happy ending
When boy meets girl and then
They never part again
But live forever happily like you and me
When boy meets girl and then they never part again
But live forever happily like you and me
Like you and me like you and me
Like you and meDrums of the islands youre beating in my heart
Youre with me no matter where I roam
If ever I wander if ever were apart
I know that you will lead me home
If I should journey across the deep blue sea
Ill never forget these coral shores
Drums of the islands I hear you calling me
And Ill return forever yours
I love each valley each grain of sand each hill
The flowers the music of the isles
These are the things I love and always will
Though I may roam ten thousand milesFrankie and me we were lovers
Oh Lordy how we could love
Swore wed be true to each other
Just as true as stars above
I was her man she caught me doing her wrong
My luck in poker was fading
When a new gal caught my eye
I gambled I tried to change my luck
With a chick named Nellie Bly
I was Frankies man but I was doing her wrong
Yeah Frankie came looking to find me
Yes she wasnt looking for fun
For in her sweet loving hand
She was totin a forty-four gun
To shoot her man if he was doin her wrong
Well Frankie walked into the bar room
And right there in front of her eyes
There was her loving johnny
Making love to that Nellie Bly
I was her man she caught me doing her wrong
Frankie I beg please dont shoot me
Well theyll put you away in a cell
You know theyll put your where the cold wind blows
From the hottest corner in hell
Im your man I know I done you wrong
Easy on the roll real easy
Easy on the roll real slow
Roll me over real gently
cause my wound hurts me so
Well I was her man
Well I done her wrong
Well Frankie told johnny
Well this is the end of my song
I was her man well I done her wrong
Well hey hey hey hey hey

Or drivin late at night

Has always been a part of me
Its in my blood I just cant get it out
For a hundred miles a man can see
And be about as wild as he wants to be
If he feels like shouting all hes gotta do is shout
Where the purple mountains reach up high
And look like theyre gonna touch the sky
Where the canyon walls have stood for a million years
Where the days are hot the nights are cold
The desert sand looks just like gold
These trails were carved in sweat and blood and tears
Where the painted desert as you pass by
Looks like a rainbow in the sky
The cactus blooms in the early morning sun
Where the night wings sing and eagles fly
The clouds paint pictures in the sky
The coyotes howl tells you when the day is done
Im coming home this time Im gonna stay
Im coming home and I aint never goin away
My feet are itching to get back home
Ive had the desert fever since Ive been gone
I need some loving so bad that I cant see
When a woman looks a man in the eye
You know it takes a man to satisfy
Thinking about them girls is killing meAha-ha hurry hurry step this way

Now the show youre going to see is strictly high class
Therell be ten hoola dancers shaking their grass
So step right up and put your money down
This way to Carny Town
We got a man so skinny you can see his bones
We play on his ribs like a xylophone
With a pair of spoons we get a rockin song
Youll hear it all in Carny Town
Hurry hurry hurry the house is almost full
We got a two headed cow and thats no bull
Theres a man who swallows swords and he never gets hurt
He eats razor blades for dessert
Hes just about the sharpest guy around

Im a poor hawaiian beach boy
A long way from the beach
cause someone shoved his face against my hand
Now Im a kissing cousin to a ripe pineapple
Im in the can
I was minding my own business
But drinking daddys juice
I swear Ill never touch that stuff again
Just like a pig before he gave his all that aluhau
Im in the pen
Got those beach boy blues
Dont the time go slow
Lonely beach boy blues
Only thirty days and ninety years to go
I want a taste of honey
From my wahinis lips
I want to be her ever loving man
But Im a kissing cousin to a ripe pineapple
Im in the canHome is where the heart is
And my heart is anywhere you are
Anywhere you are is home
I dont need a mansion on a hill
That overlooks the sea
Anywhere youre with me is home
Maybe Im a rolling stone
Who wont amount to much
But everything that I hold dear
Is close enough to touch
For home is where the heart is
And my heart is anywhere you are
Anywhere you are is home
Maybe Im a rolling stone
Who wont amount to much
But everything that I hold dear
Is close enough to touchI saw old pharaohs daughter bring Moses from the water

Take a look around tell me what you see
Here I stand like an open book
Is there something here you might have overlooked
Cause it would be a shame if you should leave
And find that freedom aint what you thought it would be
The years we had were not all bad
In fact I know the good outweighed the bad
Now you say that youve grown tired
You want to be by yourself a while
It would be a shame if you should go
And find that freedom was a long time ago
I know that you cant stand the chains that bind you
They just keep on drivin us apart
You could go where I could never find you
But could you go far enough to get away from your heart
So one more time for ol times sake
Come and lay your head upon my chest
Please dont throw this moment away
We can forget the bad and take the best
If you dont have nothing left to say
Let me hold you one more time for ol times sakeOh Im really feeling mighty low
No no no I got no place that I can go
So Ive got some blues to sing
And oh so much remembering woe
Black cats keep away from me
Take my advice go shinning up a tree
I got hard luck the hardest kind a luck youll find
I aint lyin Ive got the bluest kinda blues
Drivin me right outta my mind
Shes gone said toodle-loo
Kissed her good-bye and my-my my money too
Ive got hard luck the hardest kinda luck youve seen
I mean the way Im runnin lately
My lucky number is thirteen
Where do I belong everything I do is wrong all wrong
Wrong as can be
Whos stacking all the decks lady luck has got the hex on me
Im on her kneeOh Danny boy the pipes the pipes are calling
From glen to glen and down the mountain side
The summers gone and all the roses dying
Tis you tis you must go and I must bye
But come ye back when summers in the meadow
Or when the valleys hushed and white with snow
And Ill be here in sunshine or in shadow
Oh Danny boy oh Danny boy I love you so
But if he come and all the roses dying
And I am dead as dead I well may be
Hell come here and find the place where I am lying
And kneel and say an ava there for me
And I shall feel oh soft you tread above me
And then my grave will richer sweeter be
For you will bend and tell me that you love me
And I shall rest in peace until you come to meSome kids born with a silver spoon
I guess that I was born a little too soon
Hard knocks all I ever knew was hard knocks
And Im telling you I said youd better beware
Cause Ive had my share
Some kids born as rich as a king
But I was born without a doggone thing
Hard knocks all I ever knew was hard knocks
And Im telling you I said youd better beware
Cause Ive had my share
I walked a million miles I bet
Tired and hungry and cold and wet
Ive heard that lonesome whistle blow
From New York City down to Mexico
Some kids born fancy free
Nobody never gave nothing to me but
Hard knocks all I ever knew was hard knocks
And Im telling you I said youd better beware
Cause Ive had my share
I walked a million miles I bet
Tired and hungry and cold and wet
Ive heard that lonesome whistle blow
From New York City down to Mexico
Some kids born fancy free
Nobody never gave nothing to me but
Hard knocks all I ever knew was hard knocks
And Im telling you I said youd better beware
Cause Ive had my share
I said youd better beware
Cause Ive had my share
I said youd better beware
Cause Ive had my share of hard knocksOh baby baby baby baby baby

Take a look at a brand new fool
Fools fall in love just like schoolgirls
Blinded by rose colored dreams
They build their castles on wishes
With only rainbows for beams
Oh Theyre making plans for the future
When they should be right back in school
I used to laugh but now Im the same
Take a look at a brand new fool
All right
Theyve got their love torches burning
When they should be playing it cool
I used to laugh but now Im the same
Take a look at a brand new fool

Who went to meet El Toro
Though he fought as he had never done before
He could not beat El Toro
The bull El Toro brought him defeat and pain
And to his sorrow the matador knew shame
They said time would never heal the many scars
Brought by the great El Toro
And the bitterness that burned deep in his heart
Caused him to hate El Toro
The bull El Toro brought him defeat and pain
And to his sorrow the matador knew shame
So one night when no-one was on sight
The matador went to finish the score
In the lonely fields beneath the pale moonlight
He fought the bulland they fought once more
When they found the matador and saw him dying
Hed never see tomorrow
Now they say that on the spot where he was lying
Still walks the proud El Toro
The bull El Toro brought him defeat and pain
And to his sorrow the matador knew shameYour lips your eyes your soft sweet sights

As I step down from the train
And there to meet me is my mama and papa
Down the road I look and there runs Mary
Hair of gold and lips like cherries
Its good to touch the green green grass of home
Yes theyll all come to meet me
Arms areaching smiling sweetly
Its good to touch the green green grass of home
The old house is still standing
Though the paint is cracked and dry
And theres that old oak tree that I used to play on
Down the lane I walk and with my sweet Mary
Hair of gold and lips like cherries
Its good to touch the green green grass of home
Then I awake and look around me
At four gray walls that surround me
And I realize that I was only dreaming
For theres a guard and theres a sad old padre
Arm and arm well walk at daybreak
Again Ill touch the green green grass of home
Yes theyll all come to see me
In the shade of that old oak tree
As they lay me neath the green green grass of homeWhen Youre weary feeling small
When tears are in your eyes I will dry them all
Im on your site oh When times get rough
And friends just cant be found
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
Oh like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
When youre down and out when youre on the streets
When evening falls so hard I will comfort you
Ill take your part when the darkness falls and pain is all around
Yes like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
Oh like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
Sail on silver girl sail on by

In my soul dont you know
How the web was woven
Cant get loose cant let go
Like the weave of a spider
Wound around my heart
Im no longer free
At last Im where you want me
Dont you know thats where I want to be
Spinning round like a blue fly
Thoughts of you fill my head
And no matter oh how I try
I cant sleep in my bed
Ive been round for the last time
Oh girl what can I do
Oh the time the web was woven
How I fell in love fell in love with youI just cant help believin
When she smiles up soft and gentle
With a trace of misty morning
And the promise of tomorrow in her eyes
I just cant help believin
When shes lying close beside me
And my heart beats with the rhythm of her sighs
This time the girl is gonna stay
This time the girl is gonna stay
For more than just a day
Oh I just cant help believin
When she slips her hand in my hand
And it feels so small and helpless
As my fingers fold around it like a glove
I just cant help believin
When shes whispering her magic
And her tears are shining honey sweet with love
This time the girl is gonna stay
This time the girl is gonna stay
For more than just a day
For more than just a dayA very old friend came by today

A voice inside my coffee cup
Kept crying out
Ringing in my ears
Dont cry daddy
Daddy please dont cry
Daddy youve still got me and little Tommy
And together well find a brand new mommy
Daddy daddy please laugh again
Daddy ride us on your back again
Oh daddy please dont cry
Why are children always first
To feel the pain and the hurt the worst
Its true but somehow
It just dont seem right
Cause every time I cry I know
It hurts my little children so I wonder
Will it be the same tonight
Dont cry daddy
Daddy please dont cry
Daddy youve still got me and little Tommy
And together well find a brand new mommy

As she walked home from shcool
And then her deathbed soon claimed her
It made us so sad and so blue
Then she called me close to her bedside
And whispered these words soft and low
Tell mommy to come to me quickly
I want to kiss you both and go
Chorus
I hear a sweet voice calling
Way up in Heaven on high
God has made room for your daughter
Oh mommy and daddy dont cry
Take care of little brother
Tell him Im gone to rest
I know his little heart is broken
Hes all that you have left
Then she closed eyes forever
Never to see us no more
Until we meet our darlin
On that bright and peaceful shore
Chorus I long to be His possession
Oh He is my everything
I remember my days of darkness
Without sunshine or sight to lead the way
But a whisper of His voice softly calling
To the arms of my Maker to stay
He is my reason for living
Oh He is the king of all kings
I long to be His possession
Oh He is my everything
After the lighting and thunder
After the last bell has rung
I want to bow down before Him
And hear Him say well done
He is my reason for living
Oh He is the king of all kings
I long to be His possession
Oh He is my everythingOh well Im tired and so weary
But I must go alone
Till the Lord comes and calls
Calls me away oh yes
Well the mornings so bright
And the lamp is alight
And the night night is as black
As the sea oh yes
There will be peace in the valley for me some day
There will be peace in the valley for me oh Lord I pray
Therell be no sadness no sorrow
No trouble trouble I see
There will be peace in the valley for me for me
Well the bear will be gentle
And the wolves will be tame
And the lion shall lay down by the lamb oh yes
And the beasts from the wild
Shall be lit by a child
And Ill be changed
Changed from this creature that I am oh yes
There will be peace in the valley for me some day
There will be peace in the valley for me oh Lord I pray
Therell be no sadness no sorrow
No trouble trouble I see
There will be peace in the valley for me for meSix foot six stood on the ground weighted two hundred and thirty-five pounds
But I saw that giant of a man brought down to his knees by love
He was the kind of man who would gamble on love
Look you in the eye and never back up
But I saw him crying like a little whipped pup because of love
Cant see it with your eyes hold it in your hands
Like the rules that govern our land
Strong enough to rule the heart of every man this thing called love
It can lift you up it can put you down
Take your world and turn it all around
Ever since time nothings ever been found stronger than love
Men like me they worry and doubt
Trouble their minds day in and day out
Too busy a livin to worry about a thing called love
And then I see a mothers tenderness
As she holds her young close to her breast
Then I say thank God this world will win with the thing called loveIm gonna lay down my burden down by the riverside
Down by the riverside down by the riverside
Im gonna lay down my burden down by the riverside
Im gonna study war no more
I aint a gonna study war no more I aint a gonna study war no more
I aint a gonna study war no more I aint a gonna study war no more
I aint a gonna study war no more I aint a gonna study war no more
Well Im gonna put on my long white robe Where down by the riverside Oh
Down by the riverside down by the riverside
Im gonna put on my long white robe Where down by the riverside
Im gonna study war no more
I aint a gonna study war no more I aint a gonna study war no more
I aint a gonna study war no more I aint a gonna study war no more
I aint a gonna study war no more I aint a gonna study war no more
Well Im gonna lay down my sword and shield Where down by the riverside
Down by the riverside down by the riverside
Im gonna lay down my sword and shield A-ha down by the riverside
Im gonna study war no more
I aint a gonna study war no more I aint a gonna study war no more
I aint a gonna study war no more I aint a gonna study war no more
I aint a gonna study war no more I aint a gonna study war no moreTempted and tried were oft made to wonder
Why it should be thus all the day long
While there are others living about us
Never molested though in the wrong
Farther along well know more about it
Farther along well understand why
Cheer up my brother live in the sunshine
Well understand it all by and by
When death has come and taken our loved ones
Leaving our homes so lonely and drear
Then do we wonder how others prosper
Living so wicked year after year
Farther along well know more about it
Farther along well understand why
Cheer up my brother live in the sunshine
Well understand it all by and byAmazing Grace
How sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now am found
Was blind but now I see
Twas Grace that taught my heart to fear
And Grace my fears relieved
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed
Through many dangers toils and snares
I have already come
Tis Grace has brought me safe thus far
And Grace will lead me home
The Lord has promised good to me
His word my hope secures
He will my shield and portion be
As long as life endures
Yet when this flesh and heart shall fail
And mortal life shall cease
I shall possess within the veil
A life of joy and peace
When weve been there ten thousand years
Bright shining as the sun
Weve no less days to sing Gods praise
Than when weve first begunYou saw me crying in the chapel
The tears I shed were tears of joy
I know the meaning of contentment
I am happy with the Lord
Just a plain and simple chapel
Where all good people go to pray
I prayed the Lord that Ill grow stronger
As I live from day to day
I searched and I searched but I couldnt find
No way on earth to find peace of mind
Now Im happy in the chapel
Where people are of one accord
Yes we gather in the chapel
Just to sing and praise the Lord
Youll search and youll search but youll never find
No way on earth to find peace of mind
Take your troubles to the chapel
Get down on your knees and pray
Then your burdens will be lighter
And youll surely find a wayPrecious Lord take my hand
Lead me on let me stand
I am tired
I am weak
I am warm
Through the storm through the night
Lead me on to the light
Take my hand precious lord lead me home
When my way grows drear
Precious Lord linger near
When my life is almost gone
Hear my cry hear my call
Hold my hand lest I fall
Take my hand precious lord lead me home
When the darkness appears and the night draws near
And the day is past and gone
Let the river where I stand guide my feet hold my hand
Take my hand precious lord lead me home
Take my hand precious lord lead me homeI need Jesus to guide me every day
As Im travellin along this rough and narrow way
Though afflictions fill my soul
Im determined to make the goal

Hes only a prayer awayI believe for every drop of rain that falls
A flower grows
I believe that somewhere in the darkest night
A candle glows
I believe for everyone who goes astray
Someone will come to show the way

I believe above a storm the smallest prayer
Can still be heard
I believe that someone in the great somewhere
Hears every word
Every time I hear a new born baby cry
Or touch a leaf or see the sky
Then I know why I believe

Im a poor hawaiian beach boy
A long way from the beach
cause someone shoved his face against my hand
Now Im a kissing cousin to a ripe pineapple
Im in the can
I was minding my own business
But drinking daddys juice
I swear Ill never touch that stuff again
Just like a pig before he gave his all that aluhau
Im in the pen
Got those beach boy blues
Dont the time go slow
Lonely beach boy blues
Only thirty days and ninety years to go
I want a taste of honey
From my wahinis lips
I want to be her ever loving man
But Im a kissing cousin to a ripe pineapple
Im in the canWise men say only fools rush in
But I cant help falling in love with you
Shall I stay
Would it be a sin
If I cant help falling in love with you
Like a river flows surely to the sea
Darling so it goes
Some things are meant to be
Take my hand take my whole life too
For I cant help falling in love with you
Like a river flows surely to the sea
Darling so it goes
Some things are meant to be
Take my hand take my whole life too
For I cant help falling in love with you
For I cant help falling in love with youYou dont like crazy music

In a house that has everything everything but love
Crystal chandeliers chauffeured limousines

I see diamonds sables sapphires and pearls
And as the picture clears
Poor little rich girl sitting all alone
Counting her treasures in tears
Better just a shack where two people care
Than a house that has everything everything but love
I see diamonds sables sapphires and pearls

Poor little rich girl sitting all alone
Counting her treasures in tears
Better just a shack where two people care

Do you miss me tonight
Are you sorry we drifted apart
Does your memory stray to a brighter sunny day
When I kissed you and called you sweetheart
Do the chairs in your parlor seem empty and bare
Do you gaze at your doorstep and picture me there
Is your heart filled with pain shall I come back again
Tell me dear are you lonesome tonight
I wonder if youre lonesome tonight
You know someone said that the worlds a stage
And each must play a part
Fate had me playing in love you as my sweet heart
Act one was when we met I loved you at first glance
You read your line so cleverly and never missed a cue
Then came act two you seemed to change and you acted strange
And why Ill never know
Honey you lied when you said you loved me
And I had no cause to doubt you
But Id rather go on hearing your lies
Than go on living without you
Now the stage is bare and Im standing there
With emptiness all around
And if you wont come back to me
Then make them bring the curtain down
Is your heart filled with pain shall I come back again
Tell me dear are you lonesome tonightWell since my baby left me

Well its down at the end of Lonely Street
At Heartbreak Hotel

You still can find some room
For broken-hearted lovers
To cry there in the gloom
And be so where theyll be so lonely baby

Now the bell hops tears keep flowin
And the desk clerks dressed in black
