I beg you I beseech you to let go
My heaven is yours
And heaven is all I know
We are mortal
In the hands of God who roll the dice
Searching for an earthly paradise
So hard to find
We are mortal
Victims of our weaknesses and passion
We are reaching for the heights
I am falling from the heights
But I promise I would serve
I should be a rock against depravity and sin
Oh no sin no sin
Free yourself let your life begin
Oh
To yourself be true
I am a man of God
I should not be here with you
Free me we are mortal ah
Come a little closer to the fire
To love and live that one desire
Denial of that love is treason
The love that we make
The force of our lives and its reason
We are mortal
In the hands of Gods who roll the dice
Searching for an earthly paradise
So hard to find
We are mortal
Victims of our weaknessess and passion
I am falling I am falling we we are mortal
Why do I believe in you
Youre destroying my world
Hold nothing back
Give me all there is

This is all there is
Prisoners of each others love
Prisoners of each others loveNow my heart begins to bleed
Dee dee dee dee dee ooh oh

Safely to my home
Where I belong
Once more ooooooohWhen all the salt is taken from the sea
I stand dethroned Im naked and I bleed
But when your finger points so savagely
Is anybody there to believe in me
To hear my plea and take care of me
How can I go on from day to day
Who can make me strong in every way
Where can I be safe where can I belong
In this great big world of sadness
How can I forget those beautiful dreams that we shared
Theyre lost and theyre nowhere to be found
How can I go on
Sometimes I seem to tremble in the dark I cannot see
When people frighten me
I try to hide myself so far from the crowd
Is anybody there to comfort me
Lord take care of me
How can I go on how can I go on
From day to day from day to day
Who can make me strong who can make me strong
In every way in every way
Where can f be safe where can I be safe
Where can I belong where can I belong
In this great big world of sadness
In this great big world of sadness
How can I forget how can I forget
Those beautiful dreams that we shared
Those beautiful dreams that we shared
Theyre lost and theyre nowhere to be found
How can I go onEn mi sueno te vi
Tu luz llegaba de tan lejos
Vibra en ti
Suavemente me llevaba a ti
Tu voz dulcemente
Me decia Ven
Ven junto a mi
Saber que mi sueno no esta solo
Alienta en ti
Tu y yo cantados los dos
Yo sonaba en ser tu mismo mar tu mar
Es puente de union
De nuestras almas
Vuelan nos llaman
Al son de la eternidad
AaaahaahahahaaThe boy had a way with words he sang he moved with grace
He entertained so naturally no gesture out of place
His road in life was clearly drawn he didnt hesitate
He played they saw he conquered as the master of
As the master of his fate
The girl had an iron soul no-one could recognize
Material ambition that her gentleness disguised
She gave herself to him certain of his fame
Wanted him for luxury for limelight and his name
And then he sang to her
I love you for your silence
I love you for your peace
The still and calm releases
That sweep into my soul
That slowly take control
I love you for your passion
I love you for your fire
The violent desire
That burns me in its flame
A love I dare not name
His rise was irresistible - yeah he grew into the part
His explanation simply that he suffered for his art
No base considerations of some glittering reward
The prize was knowing that his work his work was noticed and adored
Hey
I love you yes I love you for your silence for your silence
I love you for your peace for your peace
The still and calm releases
That sweep into my soul
And slowly slowly takes control
He told the truth
Yes he told the truth and he told the truth
Accepting every honor with with a masterly display display
Of well rehearsed reluctance to be singled out this way
He started to believe that he was all they said and more and more
She forgot she forgot the reasons reasons she had wanted him before
Yeah
I love you for your passion for your passion
I love you for your fire
The violent desire
That burns me in its flame burns me
A love I dare not name
The still and calm releases releases
That sweep into my soul sweep into my soul
That slowly slowly slowly slowly slowly slowly
Slowly slowly slowly slowly slowly slowly slowly take control
And when at last they fell apart she wished that she could be
The hardened heart of yesterday as cynical as he
By changing for the better she had changed things for the worse
The words that made them happy once now echoed echoed as a curse
AaahaaahaahaahaaaI had this perfect dream
Un sueno me envolvio
This dream was me and you
Tal vez esta aqui
I want all the world to see
Un instinto me guiaba
A miracle sensation
My guide and inspiration
Now my dream is slowly coming true
The wind is a gentle breeze
EI me hablo de ti
The bells are ringing out
EI canto vuela
Theyre calling us together
Guiding us forever
Wish my dream would never go away

But we only have one more day together so
Love me like theres no tomorrow
Hold me in your arms tell me you mean it

WohIn my defense what is there to say
All the mistakes weve made must be faced today
Its not easy now knowing where to start
While the world we love tears itself apart
Im just a singer with a song
How can I try to right the wrong
For just a singer with a melody
Im caught in between with a fading dream
In my defense what is there to say
We destroy the love its our way
We never listen enough never face the truth
Then like a passing song love is here
And then its gone
Im just a singer with a song
How can I try to right the wrong
For just a singer with a melody
Im caught in between with a fading dream
Im just a singer with a song
How can I try to right the wrong
For just a singer with a melody
Im caught in between with a fading dream
Caught in between with a fading dream
Caught in between with a fading dream
Oh what on Earth Oh what on Earth
How do I try
Do we live or die
Oh help me God
Please help meI think Im goin back
To the things I learned so well in my youth
I think Im returning to
The days when I was young enough to know the truth
Now there are no games
To only pass the time
No more coloring books
No Christmas bells to chime
But thinking young and growing older is no sin
And I can play the game of life to win
I can recall a time
When I wasnt afraid to reach out to a friend
And now I think Ive got
A lot more than a skipping rope to lift
Now theres more to do
Than watch my sailboat glide
Then everyday can be my magic carpet ride
And I can play hide and seek with my fears
And live my life instead of counting my years
Let everyone debate the true reality
Id rather see the world the way it used to be
A little bit of freedom all were left
So catch me if you can
Im goin back
I can recall
I can remember
I can recall
I can remember
I can recall
I can rememberAhhhhhh oooooo
This is the way
I always dreamed it would be
The way that it is oh oh
When you are holding me
I never had a love of my own
Maybe thats why when were all alone
I can hear music
I can hear music
The sound of the city baby seems to disappear
I can hear music
Sweet sweet music
Whenever you touch me baby
Whenever youre near
Lovin you
It keeps me satisfied
And I cant explain oh no
The way Im feeling inside
You look at me we kiss and then
I close my eyes and here it comes again
I can hear music
I can hear music
The sound of the city baby seems to disappear
I can hear music
Sweet sweet music
Whenever you touch me baby
Whenever youre near

WohTime waits for nobody
Time waits for nobody
We all must plan our hopes together
Or well have no more future at all
Time waits for nobody
We might as well be deaf and dumb and blind
I know that sounds unkind
But it seems to me weve not listened to
Or spoken about it at all
The fact that time is running out for us all
Time waits for nobody
Time waits for no-one
Weve got to build this world together
Or well have no more future at all
Because time - it waits for nobody
You dont need me to tell you whats gone wrong gone wrong gone wrong
You know whats going on
But it seems to me weve not cared enough
Or confided in each other at all confided in each other at all
It seems that weve all got our backs against the wall
Time Time waits for nobody
Time waits for no-one
Weve got to trust in one another
Or therell be no more future at all
Time
Yeah - Time waits for nobody
No no - Time dont wait for no-one
Lets learn to be friends with one another
Or therell be no more future at all
Time time time time waits for nobody waits for nobody
Time time time time waits for nobody at all
Time waits for nobody - yeah
Time dont wait - waits for no-one
Let us free this world for ever
And build a brand new future for us all

Time after time
Ive done my sentence
But committed no crime

And well keep on fighting til the end
We are the champions

No time for losers
Cause we are the champions of the world
Ive taken my bows

No pleasure cruise
I consider it a challenge before the whole human race
And I aint gonna lose

In her pretty cabinet
Let them eat cake she says
Just like Marie Antoinette
A built-in remedy
For Kruschev and Kennedy
At anytime an invitation
You cant decline
Caviar and cigarettes
Well versed in etiquette
Extraordinarily nice
Chorus
Shes a Killer Queen
Gunpowder gelatine
Dynamite with a laser beam
Guaranteed to blow your mind
Anytime
Recommended at the price
Insatiable in appetite
Wanna try
To avoid complications
She never kept the same address
In conversation
She spoke like a baroness
Met a man from China
Went down to Geisha Minah
Then again incidentally
If youre that way inclined
Perfume came naturally from Paris
For cars she couldnt care less
Fastidious and precise
Chorus
Drop of a hat shes a willing as
Playful as a pussy cat
Then momentarily out of action
Temporarily out of gas
To absolutely drive you wild wild
Shes all out to get you
