Peace will come to me
Peace will come to me
Im leaving bitterness behind
This time Im cleaning up my mind
There is no space for the regrets
I will remember to forget
Just look at me
I am walking love incarnate
Look at the frequencies of which I vibrate
Im going to light up the world
Peace will come to me
Peace will come to me
Im leaving anger in the past
With all the shadows that it cast
There is radar in my heart
I should have trusted from the start
Just look at me
I am a living act of holiness
Giving all the positive virtues that I possess
Im going to light up the world
Peace will come to me
Just wait and see
Peace will come to me
Its meant to be
Peace will come to me
Just wait and see
Peace will come to me
Its inevitabilityInstrumentalInstrumentalI was born with the wrong sign
In the wrong house
With the wrong ascendancy
I took the wrong road
That led to the wrong tendencies
I was in the wrong place at the wrong time
For the wrong reason and the wrong rhyme
On the wrong day of the wrong week
I used the wrong method with the wrong technique
Wrong
Wrong
Theres something wrong with me chemically
Something wrong with me inherently
The wrong mix in the wrong genes
I reached the wrong ends by the wrong means
It was the wrong plan
In the wrong hands
With the wrong theory for the wrong man
The wrong lies on the wrong vibes
The wrong questions with the wrong replies
Wrong
Wrong
I was marching to the wrong drum
With the wrong scum
Pissing out the wrong energy
Using all the wrong lines
And the wrong signs
With the wrong intensity
I was on the wrong page of the wrong book
With the wrong rendition of the wrong hook
Made the wrong move every wrong night
With the wrong tune played till it sounded right yeah
Wrong
Wrong
Too long
Wrong
I was born with the wrong sign
In the wrong house
With the wrong ascendancy
I took the wrong road
That led to the wrong tendencies
I was in the wrong place at the wrong time
For the wrong reason and the wrong rhyme
On the wrong day of the wrong week
I used the wrong method with the wrong technique
WrongIm the ghost in your house
Calling your name
My memory lingers
Youll never be the same
Im the hole in your heart
Im the stain in your bed
The phantom in your fingers
The voices in your head
One touch is all it took
To draw you in
To leave you hooked
One kiss you paid the price
You had a taste
Of paradise
Now youre running in circles
Chasing imaginary footsteps
Reaching for shadows
In the bed where I once slept
Im the ghost in your house
Calling your name
My memory lingers
Youll never be the same
Im the hole in your heart
Im the stain in your bed
The phantom in your fingers
The voices in your head
One thought is all it takes
You lose control
You make mistakes
This pain will never leave
Until I die
Youll always grieve
Now youre falling to pieces
Seeing my face wherever you go
Talking to strangers
From a place theyll never knowTake my hand
And walk in the light
Understand theres a fire to ignite
You know we have a responsibility
Its true weve been chosen
And now we have the possibility
Of melting whats frozen
Walk with me with the rapture inside
Cant you see its not our place to decide
You know we have to make a case for love
Its more of a duty
Its clear we have a mission from above
A mission of beauty
You know I wouldnt lie to you
What would I achieve by that
Its more than I would try to do
These are the facts
Take your place here
With love in your heart
Just embrace what youve known from the start
We are fulfilling our only destiny
The angels have spoken
And all the gods in the universe agree
The spell cant be brokenWell its a fragile tension thats keeping us going
It may not last forever but of all wind is blowing
Theres something magical in the air
Some things so tragic we have to care
Its a strange obsession its drawing us nearer
We dont understand it it never gets clearer
Theres something mystical in our dreams
Theyre so simplistic it kicks and screams
Oh when we see too recon the art occult that nothing can keep us down
Its a dizzying feeling thats keeping us flying
Some glittering gauntlet without even trying
Theres something magical in our hands
Nothing logical to our plansTheyre almost falling over you
Why dont they call a truce
What ever they are trying to do
Its of little use
Theyre drowning you in compliments
Trying to furnish proof
Although they speak with eloquence
There is little truth
Chorus
Youre bright youre strong you know the right from wrong
At least to some degree
Youre wise youre tough youve heard their lies enough
You smile in sympathy
Im watching your serenity
The way your so transense
The tidiest absurdities
Your patience never ends
And as the night begins to fade
Your heading for the door
Followed by sad parade
Your on your own once more
Chorus One subtle look
God help me
Is all it took
To sell me
One single word
Unspoken
Your name unheard
And Im broken
The sun and the moon
and the stars in the sky are laughing
Theyve seen it all before
For the wind in the trees
and the waves on the seas
Its the same thing
They cant take any more
One gentle touch
And Im helpless
Its all too much
For my senses
One simple prayer
Denied me
When youre not there
Beside me
The sun and the moon
and the stars in the sky are laughing
Theyve seen it all before
For the wind in the trees
and the waves on the seas
Its the same thing
They cant take any moreOh youve got a way about you
Oh I know so much about you
Girl
Life wont be the same without you
Life will surely be the one to tell
Listen to what shes trying to tell you
She could be the one whos going to save you
Oh well
Oh well
Life wont be the same without you
Life will surely be the one to tell
Its nothing to feel ashamed about
Nothing I can complain about
Oh well
Oh well
Oh well
Oh well
Wooooaaaa mumma
Listen to what shes trying to tell you
She could be the one whos going to save you
Oh well
Oh well
Its nothing to feel ashamed about
Nothing I can complain about
O-oh well
Oh well
Oh well
Oh well
Oh youve got a way about you
Oh I know so much about you
Girl
Life wont be the same without you
Life will surely be the one to tell
Oh well
Oh well
Oh well
Oh well
Life wont be the same without you
Life will surely be the one to tell
Oh well
Oh well
Oh well
Oh wellWe are here we can love
We share something
Im sure that youll mean the world to me
When you get what you need
Its no way of knowing
What you get is another hole to feed
Your name was the one that was always chosen
Your words and the kindness that set me free
Words can leave you broken inside
Youll have to decide
Im hanging onto my pride
We are here we can love
We share something
Im sure that youll mean the world to me
The shame as a hole that has kept us frozen
You open my eyes to the world I could believe
This world has left me broken inside
Ill have to decide
Im hanging onto my pride
Words can leave you broken inside
Youll have to decide
Im hanging onto my pride
We are here
This world can leave you broken inside
Ill have to decide
Im hanging onto my pride
We are here we can love
We share something
Im sure that youll mean the world to me
The shame as a hole that has kept us frozen
You open my eyes to the world I could believeI could corrupt you
In a heart beat
You think your so special
Think your so sweet
What are you trying dont even tempt me
Soon youll be crying unwishing you dreamt of be
Youll be calling out my name
When you need someone to blame
I can corrupt you
It would be easy
Watching you suffer
God it would please me
I wanna touch you with my little finger
I know it will crush you my memory would linger
Youd be crying out in pain
Begging me to play my games
I can corrupt you
It will be ugly
They could sedate you
But what good would drugs be
I wanna touch you with my hands on your hips
It would be too much to
Place my lips on your lips
Youll be calling out my name
Begging me to play my gamesOn another world by another star at another place and time
In another state of consciousness in another state of mind
Everything was almost perfect everything fell into place
That you may reach a different verdict
If all the judges missed the case
In a parallel universe thats happening right now
Things between us must be worse but its hard to see just how
And everything could have been perfect
Everything in the right place
Then I wouldnt have to play the suspect
Accused abandoned and disgraced
I didnt choose i didnt pull the trigger
It wasnt me im just a plain and simple singer
I heard the sound i turned my head around
To watch our love shot down
In another lonely universe were laying side by side
Well no-ones hurt and no-ones cursed and no one needs to hide
And everything is almost perfect
Everything is almost right
There are never any conflicts
There are never any fightsI would tell you about the things
They put me through
The pain Ive been subjected to
But the Lord himself would blush
The countless feasts laid at my feet
Forbidden fruits for me to eat
But I think your pulse would start to rush
Now Im not looking for absolution
Forgiveness for the things I do
But before you come to any conclusions
Try walking in my shoes
Try walking in my shoes
Youll stumble in my footsteps
Keep the same appointments I kept
If you try walking in my shoes
If you try walking in my shoes
Morality would frown upon
Decency look down upon
The scapegoat fates made of me
But I promise now my judge and jurors
My intentions couldnt have been purer
My case is easy to see
Im not looking for a clearer conscience
Peace of mind after what Ive been through
And before we talk of any repentance
Try walking in my shoes
Try walking in my shoes
Youll stumble in my footsteps
Keep the same appointments I kept
If you try walking in my shoes
If you try walking in my shoes
Try walking in my shoes
Now Im not looking for absolution
Forgiveness for the things I do
But before you come to any conclusions
Try walking in my shoes
Try walking in my shoes
Youll stumble in my footsteps
Keep the same appointments I kept
If you try walking in my shoes
Youll stumble in my footsteps
Keep the same appointments I kept
If you try walking in my shoes
Try walking in my shoes
If you try walking in my shoes
Try walking in my shoesIts one of those conversations
Weve weve had them before
The ones that leave you empty
And wanting for more
Your eyes they tell me something
That I understand
Your eyes they hold the truth
And the truth is
Youre miles away Repeat 
Excuse me for my hesitation
ave I met you before
Your face seems so familiar
And longing for more
Your eyes they tell me something
That I understand
Your eyes they hold the truth
And a truth is
Youre miles away Repeat 
With all your superstitions
And empty lines
I could be just like you
Withdrawn but alive
Life it has its limitations
We all have our needs
Love could be the only answer
It lies underneath
Your eyes they tell me something
That I understand
Your eyes they hold the truth
And a truth is
Youre miles away Repeat They call you Jezebel
Whenever we walk in
Youre going straight to hell
For wanton acts of sin they say
And that Ill have to pay
But I need you just this way
They call you Jezebel
For what you like to wear
Youre morally unwell
They say you never care for me
But what the fail to see is that your games are the key
Open their eyes to the beauty
Open their hearts to the fun
Open their minds to the idea that you dont own someone
They call you Jezebel
Whenever men walk by
They say that they can tell
The longing in your eyes is real
And how you really feel
But they cant see your appealMy little light
Is going to shine
Shine out so bright
And illuminate your mind
My little soul
Will leave a footprint
This little voice
Is going to sing
I have no choice
It will infinitely ring
My little soul
Will leave a footprint
Im channeling the universe
Its focusing its love inside of me
A Singularity
My little words
Are going to sting
Havent you heard
The pain and joy they bring
My little soul
Will leave a footprint
Im channeling the universe
Its focusing its love inside of me
A singularity
Your little eyes
Theyre going to see
I cant disguise
The beauty inside me
My little soul
Will leave a footprintThe way you move
Has got me yearning
The way you move
Has left me burning
I know you know what youre doing to me
I know my hands will never be free
I know what its like to be
In chains
The way you move
Is meant to haunt me
The way you move
To tempt and taunt me
I know you knew on the day you were born
I know somehow I shouldve been warned
I know I walk every midnight to dawn
In Chains
In chains Im in chains
In chains Im in chains
Youve got me dying for you
Its you that Im living through
Youve got me praying to you
Saying to you anything you want me to
Youve got me reaching for you
My souls beseeching me too
Youve got me singing to you
Bringing to you anything you ask me to
The way you move
Is mesmerizing
The way you move
Is hypnotizing
I know I crumble when you are around
Start to mumble a bit of a false sound
Straggle stumble shackled and bound
In chains
In chains Im in chains
In chains Im in chains
Youve got me dying for you
Its you that Im living through
Youve got me praying to you
Saying to you anything you want me to
Youve got me reaching for you
My souls beseeching me too
Youve got me singing to you
Bringing to you anything you ask me to
Im in chains
In chains Im in chains
In chains Im in chains
In chains Im in chainsChorus
Come back Come back to me
Ive been waiting here patiently
Ive been walking a thin white line
Between love and hate
I could use a lil company
A lil kindness to go a long way
Weeks turn into months
Months turn into years
Reaching the same conclusions
Gathering up the fear
Chorus
Ive been walking a thin white line
Between love and hate
I could use a lil company
A lil kindness to go a long way
Weeks turn into months
Months turn into years
Reaching the same conclusions
Gathering up the fear
Come back Come back to meReach out and touch faith
Your own personal Jesus
Someone to hear your prayers
Someone who cares
Your own personal Jesus
Someone to hear your prayers
Someone whos there
Feeling unknown
And youre all alone
Flesh and bone
By the telephone
Lift up the receiver
Ill make you a believer
Take second best
Put me to the test
Things on your chest
You need to confess
I will deliver
You know Im a forgiver
Reach out and touch faith
Reach out and touch faith

Open your sensitive mouth
And talk to me
Hold out your delicate hands
And feel me
Couldnt make any plans
To conceal me
Open your sensitive mouth
Hold out your delicate hands
With such a sensitive mouth
Im easy to see through
When I come up
When I rush
I rush for you
Cry for you
Seen the tears
Roll down from my eyes for you
Heard my truth
Distorting to lies for you
Watched my love
Becoming a prize for you
Seen the tears in my eyes
Heard my truth turn to lies
Seen the tears in my eyes
Im not proud of what I do
When I come up
When I rush
I rush for you
I come up to meet you
Up there somewhere
When I rush to greet you
My soul is bared
Gave more for you
Dropped my crutches
And crawled on the floor for you
Went looking behind every door for you
And because of the things
That I saw for you
I spiritually grew
When I come up
When I rush
I rush for youYou had something to hide
Should have hidden it shouldnt you
Now youre not satisfied
With what youre being put through
Its just time to pay the price
For not listening to advice
And deciding in your youth
On the policy of truth
Things could be so different now
It used to be so civilised
You will always wonder how
It could have been if youd only lied
Its too late to change events
Its time to face the consequence
For delivering the proof
In the policy of truth
Never again
Is what you swore
The time before
Never again
Is what you swore
The time before
Now youre standing there tongue tied
Youd better learn your lesson well
Hide what you have to hide
And tell what you have to tell
Youll see your problems multiplied
If you continually decide
To faithfully pursue
The policy of truth
Never again
Is what you swore
The time beforeFragile
Like a baby in your arms
Be gentle with me
Id never willingly
Do you harm
Apologies
Are all you seem to get from me
But just like a child
You make me smile
When you care for me
And you know
Its a question of lust
Its a question of trust
Its a question of not letting
What weve built up crumble to dust
An it is all of these things and more
That keep us together
Independence
Is still important for us though
We realize
Its easy to make the stupid mistake
Of letting go
Do you know what I mean
My weaknesses
You know each and every one
It frightens me
I need to drink
More than you seem to think
Before Im anyones
And you know
Its a question of lust
Its a question of trust
Its a question of not letting
What weve built up crumble to dust
An it is all of these things and more
That keep us together
Kiss me goodbye
When Im on my own
But you know that Id
Rather be home
Its a question of lust
Its a question of trust
Its a question of not letting
What weve built up crumble to dust
An it is all of these things and more
That keep us together
Its a question of lust
Its a question of trust
Its a question of not letting
What weve built up crumble to dust
An it is all of these things and more
That keep us together
Its a question of lust
Its a question of trust
Its a question of not letting
What weve built up crumble to dust
An it is all of these things and more
That keep us together
Its a question of lust
Its a question of trust
Its a question of not letting
What weve built up crumble to dust
An it is all of these things and more
That keep us togetherThe handshake
Seals the contract
From the contracts
Theres no turning back
The turning point
Of a career
In career being insincere
The holiday
Was fun packed
The contract
Still intact
The grabbing hands
Grab all they can
All for themselves
After all
Its a competitive world
Everything counts in large amounts
The graph
On the wall
Tells the story
Of it all
Picture it now
See just how
The lies and deceit
Gained a little more power
Confidence
Taken in
By a sun tan
And a grin
The grabbing hands
Grab all they can
All for themselves
After all
Its a competitive world
Everything counts in large amounts
The grabbing hands
Grab all they can
Everything counts in large amountsLet me take you on a trip
Around the world and back
And you wont have to move
You just sit still
Now let your mind do the walking
And let my body do the talking
Let me show you the world in my eyes
Ill take you to the highest mountain
To the depths of the deepest sea
We wont need a map believe me
Now let my body do the moving
And let my hands do the soothing
Let me show you the world in my eyes
Thats all there is
Nothing more than you can feel now
Thats all there is
Let me put you on a ship
On a long long trip
Your lips close to my lips
All the islands in the ocean
All the heavens in the motion
Let me show you the world in my eyes
Thats all there is
Nothing more than you can touch now
Thats all there is
Let me show you the world in my eyesWhen Im with you baby I go out of my head
And I just cant get enough I just cant get enough
All the things you do to me and everything you said
And I just cant get enough I just cant get enough
We slip and slide as we fall in love
And I just cant seem to get enough
We walk together were walking down the street
And I just cant get enough I just cant get enough
Every time I think of you I know we have to meet
And I just cant get enough I just cant get enough
Its getting hotter its our burning love
And I just cant seem to get enough
And when it rains youre shining down for me
And I just cant get enough I just cant get enough
Just like a rainbow you know you set me free
And I just cant get enough I just cant get enough
Youre like an angel and you give me your love
And I just cant seem to get enoughWords like violence
Break the silence
Come crashing in
Into my little world
Painful to me
Pierce right through me
Cant you understand
Oh my little girl
All I ever wanted
All I ever needed
Is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm
Vows are spoken
To be broken
Feelings are intense
Words are trivial
Pleasures remain
So does the pain
Words are meaningless
And forgettable
All I ever wanted
All I ever needed
Is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm
All I ever wanted
All I ever needed
Is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm
All I ever wanted
All I ever needed
Is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm
Enjoy the silenceShe was silent trying to be
Like the girl who acted on the TV
Always knowing when to say
Wishing for a moment so that they could see
Staring in the night
A picture in my room
And I think that she knew her lines
Break away tonight
I want to hold your hand
Weve got to get it right
Weve got to understand
Carefully watching waiting as I
Stood upon the back streets and we start to play
I was screaming louder as the
Curtains fall between us in a twisted way
Staring in the night
A picture in my room
And I think that she knew her lines
Break away tonight
I want to hold your hand
Weve got to get it right
Weve got to understand
Placing all the questions in the
Minutes of a game we won so long ago
Dangerous and beautiful the
Radio transmission that I have to know
You could never run
You could never stay
And I think you belong to me
Break away tonight
I want to hold your hand
Weve got to get it right
Weve got to understandCan you feel a little love
Can you feel a little love
Dream on
Dream on
As your bony fingers close around me
Long and spindly
Death becomes me
Heaven can you see what I see
Hey you pale and sickly child
Youre death and living reconciled
Been walking home a crooked mile
Paying debt to karma
You party for a living
What you take wont kill you
But careful what youre giving
Theres no time for hesitating
Pain is ready pain is waiting
Primed to do its educating
Unwanted uninvited kin
It creeps beneath your crawling skin
It lives without it lives within you
Feel the fever coming
Youre shaking and twitching
You can scratch all over
But that wont stop you itching
Can you feel a little love
Can you feel a little love
Dream on
Dream on
Blame it on your karmic curse
Oh shame upon the universe
It knows its lines
Its well rehearsed
It sucked you in it dragged you down
To where there is no hallowed ground
Where holiness is never found
Paying debt to karma
You party for a living
What you take wont kill you
But careful what youre giving
Can you feel a little love
Can you feel a little love
Dream on
Dream onWords like violence
Break the silence
Come crashing in
Into my little world
Painful to me
Pierce right through me
Cant you understand
Oh my little girl
All I ever wanted
All I ever needed
Is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm
Vows are spoken
To be broken

So does the pain
Words are meaningless
And forgettable
All I ever wanted

Words are very unnecessary

Words are very unnecessary

Enjoy the silenceWell if you ever plan to motor west
Travel my way take the highway thats the best
Get your kicks on route sixty-six
Well it winds from chicago to la

Get your kicks on route sixty-sixIn your room
Where time stands still
Or moves at your will
Will you let the morning come soon
Or will you leave me lying here
In your favourite darkness
Your favourite half-light
Your favourite consciousness
Your favourite slave
In your room
Where souls disappear
Only you exist here
Will you lead me to your armchair
Or leave me lying here
Your favourite innocence
Your favourite prize
Your favourite smile
Your favourite slave
Im hanging on your words
Living on your breath
Feeling with your skin
Will I always be here
In your room
Your burning eyes
Cause flames to arise
Will you let the fire die down soon
Or will I always be here
Your favourite passion
Your favourite game
Your favourite mirror
Your favourite slave
Im hanging on your words
Living on your breath
Feeling with your skin
Will I always be hereTheres a new game
We like to play you see
A game with added reality
You treat me like a dog
Get me down on my knees
We call it master and servant
We call it master and servant
Its a lot like life
This play between the sheets
With you on top and me underneath
Forget all about equality
Lets play master and servant
Lets play master and servant
Its a lot like life
And thats whats appealing
If you despise that throwaway feeling
From disposable fun
Then this is the one
Dominations the name of the game
In bed or in life
Theyre both just the same
Except in one youre fulfilled
At the end of the day
Lets play master and servant
Lets play master and servant
Lets play master and servant
Come on master and servantTheres more besides joyrides
Little house in the countryside
Understand learn to demand
Compromise sometimes lie
Get the balance right get the balance right
Be responsible respectable
Stable but gullible
Concerned and caring help the helpless
But always remain ultimately selfish
Get the balance right get the balance right
You think youve got a hold of it all
You havent got a hold at all
When you reach the top get ready to drop
Prepare yourself for the fall youre gonna fall
Its almost predictable
Dont take this way dont take that way
Straight down the middle until next Thursday
Push to the left back to the right
Twist and turn till youve got it right
Get the balance rightCome back to the land
Let me see you
Stripped down to the bone
Metropolis
Has nothing on this
Youre breathing in fumes
I taste when we kissStrangelove
Strange highs and strange lows
Strangelove
Thats how my love goes
Strangelove
Will you give it to me
Will you take the pain
I will give to you
Again and again
And will you return it
Therell be times
When my crimes
Will seem almost unforgivable
I give in to sin
Because you have to make this life livable
But when you think Ive had enough
From your sea of love
Ill take more than another river full
Yes and Ill make it all worthwhile
Ill make your heart smile
Strangelove
Strange highs and strange lows
Strangelove
Thats how my love goes
Strangelove
Will you give it to me
Will you take the pain
I will give to you
Again and again
And will you return it
Therell be days
When Ill stray
I may appear to be
Constantly out of reach
I give in to sin
Because I like to practice what I preach
Im not trying to say
Ill have it all my way
Im always willing to learn
When youve got something to teach
And Ill make it all worthwhile
Ill make your heart smile
Pain will you return it
Ill say it again pain
Pain will you return it
Ill say it again pain
Pain will you return it
Ill say it again pain
Pain will you return it
I wont say it again

To make you mine

Right next to me
You can run but you cannot hide
Dont say you want me
Dont say you need me
Dont say you love me
Its understood
Dont say youre happy
Out there without me
I know you cant be
Cause its no good
Ill be fine
Ill be waiting patiently
Till you see the signs
And come running to my open arms
When will you realize
Do we have to wait till our worlds collide
Open up your eyes
You cant turn back the tide
Dont say you want me
Dont say you need me
Dont say you love me
Its understood
Dont say youre happy
Out there without me
I know you cant be
Cause its no good
Im going to take my time
I have all the time in the world
To make you mine
It is written in the stars above
Dont say you want me
Dont say you need me
Dont say you love me
Its understood
Dont say youre happy
Out there without me
I know you cant be
Cause its no goodWell its about time
Its beginning to hurt
Time you made up your mind
Just what is it all worth
All my useless advice
All my hanging around
All your cutting down to size
All my bringing you down
Watch the clock on the wall
Feel the slowing of time
Hear a voice in the hall
Echoing in my mind
All your stupid ideals
Got your head in the clouds
You should see how it feels
With your feet on the ground
Here I stand the accused
With your fist in my face
Feeling tired and bruised
With the bitterest taste
All my useless advice
All my hanging around
All your cutting down to size
All my bringing you down
All your stupid ideals
Got your head in the clouds
You should see how it feels
With your feet on the groundYou wear guilt
Like shackles on your feet
Like a halo in reverse
I can feel
The discomfort in your seat
And in your head its worse
Theres a pain
A famine in your heart
An aching to be free
Cant you see
All loves luxuries
Are here for you and me
And when our worlds they fall apart
When the walls come tumbling in
Though we may deserve it
It will be worth it
Bring your chains
Your lips of tragedy
And fall into my armsCome with me
Into the trees
Well lay on the grass
And let the hours pass
Take my hand
Come back to the land
Lets get away
Just for one day
Let me see you
Stripped down to the bone
Let me see you
Stripped down to the bone
Metropolis
Has nothing on this
Youre Breathing In Fumes
I taste when we kiss
Take my hand
Come back to the land
Where everythings ours
For a few hours
Let me see you
Stripped down to the bone
Let me see you
Stripped down to the bone
Let me hear you
Make decisions
Without your television
Let me hear you speaking
Just for me
Let me see you
Stripped down to the bone
Let me hear you speaking
Just for me
Let me see you
Stripped down to the bone Let me hear you crying
Just for meChorus 
Come on and lay with me
Come on and lie to me
Tell me you love me
Say Im the only one
Experiences have a lasting impression
But words once spoken
Dont mean a lot now
Belief is the way
The way of the innocent
And when I say innocent
I should say naive
So lie to me
But do it with sincerity
Make me listen
Just for a minute
Make me think
Theres some truth in it
Promises made for convenience
Arent necessarily
What we need
Truth is a word
Thats lost its meaning
The truth has become
Merely half-truth
So lie to me
Like they do it in the factory
Make me think
That at the end of the day
Some great reward
Will be coming my wayIm taking a ride
With my best friend
I hope he never lets me down again
He knows where hes taking me
Taking me where I want to be
Im taking a ride
With my best friend
Were flying high
Were watching the world pass us by
Never want to come down
Never want to put my feet back down
On the ground
Im taking a ride
With my best friend
I hope he never lets me down again
Promises me Im as safe as houses
As long as I remember whos wearing the trousers
I hope he never lets me down again
Never let me down
See the stars theyre shining bright
Everythings alright tonightHere is a song from the wrong side of town
Where Im bound to the ground by the loneliest sound
And it pounds from within and is pinning me down
Here is a page from the emptiest stage
A cage or the heaviest cross ever made
A gauge of the deadliest trap ever laid
And I thank you for bringing me here
For showing me home
For singing these tears
Finally Ive found that I belong here
The heat and the sickliest sweet smelling sheets
That cling to the backs of my knees and my feet
Well Im drowning in time to a desperate beat
God send the only true friend I call mine
Pretend that Ill make amends the next time
Befriend the glorious end of the line
And I thank you for bringing me here
For showing me home
For singing these tears
Finally Ive found that I belong hereSitting target

They put me through
The pain Ive been subjected to
But the Lord himself would blush
The countless feasts laid at my feet
Forbidden fruits for me to eat
But I think your pulse would start to rush
Now Im not looking for absolution
Forgiveness for the things I do
But before you come to any conclusions
Try walking in my shoes

Youll stumble in my footsteps
Keep the same appointments I kept

Morality would frown upon
Decency look down upon
The scapegoat fates made of me
But I promise now my judge and jurors
My intentions couldnt have been purer
My case is easy to see
Im not looking for a clearer conscience
Peace of mind after what Ive been through
And before we talk of any repentance

Finding the whole thing hard to swallow
Everybodys looking for a reason to live
If youre looking for a reason Ive a reason to give
Pleasure little treasure
Everybodys looking for a new sensation
Everybodys talking about the state of the nation
Everybodys searching for a promised land
Everybodys failing to understand
Pleasure little treasure
Everybodys looking for a reason to live
If youre looking for a reason
Ive a reason to give
Pleasure little treasure
Maternity frocks and paternity suits
If thats what you want
Theyre waiting for you
Everybody needs some reason or other
Youll find a reason when you discover

Its time to make amends
For all of the fun
The damage is done
And I feel diseased
Im down on my knees
And I need forgiveness
Someone to bear witness
To the goodness within
Beneath the sin
Although I may flirt
With all kinds of dirt
To the point of disease
Now I want release
From all this decay
Take it away
And somewhere
Theres someone who cares
With a heart of gold
To have and to holdOoh Ive been dirt
And I dont care
Ooh Ive been dirt
And I dont care
Cause Im burning inside

Someone saying prayers for me
For all the right reasonsThe handshake
Seals the contract
From the contracts
Theres no turning back
The turning point
Of a career
In career being insincere
The holiday
Was fun packed
The contract
Still intact
The grabbing hands
Grab all they can
All for themselves
After all
Its a competitive world
Everything counts in large amounts
The graph
On the wall
Tells the story
Of it all
Picture it now
See just how
The lies and deceit
Gained a little more power
Confidence
Taken in
By a sun tan
And a grin
The grabbing hands
Grab all they can
All for themselves
After all
Its a competitive world
Everything counts in large amounts
The grabbing hands
Grab all they can
Everything counts in large amountsIf you need a friend dont look to a stranger
You know in the end Ill always be there
But when youre in doubt and when youre in danger
Take a look all around and Ill be there
Im sorry but Im just thinking of the right words to say
I know they dont sound the way I planned them to be
But if youll wait around awhile Ill make you fall for me
I promise you I promise you I will
When your day is through and so is your temper
You know what to do Im gonna always be there
Sometimes if I shout its not whats intended
These words just come out with no cross to bear
Im sorry but Im just thinking of the right words to say
I know they dont sound the way I planned them to be
But if youll wait around awhile Ill make you fall for me
I promise you I promise you
Im sorry but Im just thinking of the right words to say
I know they dont sound the way I planned them to be
And if I had to walk the world Id make you fall for me
I promise you I promise you I will
I gotta tell you I gotta tell you I need to tell you
Im sorry but Im just thinking of the right words to say
I know they dont sound the way I planned them to be
But if youll wait around awhile Ill make you fall for me
I promise you I promise you
Im sorry but Im just thinking of the right words to say
I know they dont sound the way I planned them to be
And if I had to walk the world Id make you fall for me
I promise you I promise you I will I will I willThere is darkness and death in your eyes
What have you got buried inside
The shallow grave in your soul
The ghosts that have taken control
You really should have dug a little deeper there
Body parts are starting to appear and scare
The child inside away
Each tear that flows down your face
Trickles then picks up the pace
And turns to a river inside
A river that will not subside
I can hear that dreadful overflowing sound
And watching from afar I see a child is drowned
The child inside your heart
I can see you drifting away
Heading for the light
I can see you drifting away
Every night
Why were you always inside
On days when the weather was fine
And while we were running around
You were nowhere to be found
You know you should have taken all your dolls to bed
Well you were made to play games with your soul instead
The child inside you diedIf you want control without any pain
How long will you suffer
How long will you wait
Is she the friend that I knew
He cannot be banned
Replaced by another
Wearing his crown
Theres a place where I go
Without any sand
Only you can reach me
Only youre allowed
And youre so far away
Youre so far from here
Do you remember
Our time without tears
When youre falling
I will catch you
You dont have to fall that far
You can make it
I will be there
You were broken for the start
And you were a child
You dream all day long
You dream of the future
Get lost in your sounds
Now that time is gone
Its lost for you now
Words long forgotten
Forgotten somehow
When youre falling
I will catch you
You dont have to fall that far
You can make it
I will be there
You were broken for the start
When youre falling
I will catch you
You dont have to fall that far
You can make it
I will be there
You were broken for the startIm coming for you
When the sun goes down
Im coming for you
When theres no one around
I come to your house
Break down the door
Girl Im shaking
I need more
Theres only one way to soothe my soul theres only one way to soothe my soul

Only one way Only one way
Only one wayMy little universe is expanding slowly
Those who know me say Im growing every day
Beautiful emptiness surrounds me
I take small steps
Im making progress in an unspecific way
Here I am king
I decide everything
I let no one in
No one
No one
No one
The limited consciousness preserves me
It protects me
And just connects enough to keep the walls at bay
My little universe is expanding slowly
Those who know me say Im growing every day
Here I am king
I decide everything
I let no one in
No one
No one
No oneI know its hard to reach you
I know its hard to breathe
I know its hard to be you sometimes
I cant imagine what that means
This must be someone elses story
I cant follow what youve planned
How could this be about me
Am I supposed to understand
Like a ship on the ocean
Heading out to sea
You can hardly see it now
Its a lot like you
Lost like me
Youre still looking for redemption
Still cant find a trace
If there is nothing after
There ll be the saving grace
Im giving you control now
I need some kind of sign
Cant take away the sorrow now
I gave you all thats mine
Like a ship on the ocean
Heading out to sea
You can hardly see it now
Its a lot like you
Like a ship on the ocean
Heading out to sea
You can hardly see it now
Its a lot like you
Lost like meWhen I look at you
Im probably the same way too
I got a feeling that its coming soon
Could this be the end
And when I look around this room
It must be something I can do
Can I convince you that it isnt true
Weve come to the end
Oh did I disappoint you
I wanted to believe its true
Oh the book of love
Was not enough to see us through
The problem shouldve been you shouldve been you
Shouldve been you shouldve been you
Shouldve been you couldve been you shouldve been you
If it hadnt been me couldve been you couldve been you
Shouldve been you shouldve been you
Shouldve been you couldve been you
Shouldve been you
If it hadnt been me
It seems so obvious to you
Youre feeling what Im feeling too
The final chapter in the contract expires soon
Weve come to the end
Thank God Im not the same as you
You always know exactly what to do
Is who I am is not for you
Weve come to the end
Oh did I disappoint you
I wanted to believe its true
Oh the book of love
Was not enough to see us through
The problem shouldve been you shouldve been you
Shouldve been you couldve been you
Shouldve been you wouldve been you shouldve been you
If it hadnt been me wouldve been you couldve been you
Shouldve been you shouldve been you
Shouldve been you wouldve been you shouldve been you
If it hadnt been me Couldve been you shouldve been you couldve been you
Wouldve been you wouldve been you
Shouldve been you Couldve been you shouldve been you couldve been you
If it hadnt been me wouldve been you couldve been you wouldve been you

If it hadnt been me couldve been you couldve been you couldve been you
If it hadnt been meThe well is dry and this
The sun is high and the field might sparrow
A time and my body aching
Now Im opened wide and afraid of breaking
The fire is hot and the tables are ready
But the stomach nuts make my hands unsteady
So I take to pace and up and down the room
While my heart keeps racing and my minds confused
I just wanna be part of the light
Of the light of the light of the light of the light in your eyes
I just wanna be part of the light
Of the light of the light of the light of the light in your eyes
The bed is made and the candles burning
All our and the clock keeps turning
Were out of tricks with the silence cutting
And the dagger stick as the doors keep shuttingNo need to feel ashamed
Theres nothing to be gained
When your dreams are in the past
Like stars we crush and burn
Only to return
Life goes by so fast
So who is left to play
Nothings quite the same
We cant live in the past
Im burning inside as the sun
And I only just begun
Love it fades so fast
Sometimes I forget all I will regret
When I leave this world behind
And sometimes Im not sure
What Im fighting for
It happens all the time
I know Ive had enough maybe far too much
Its easy to be kind
And when its just me and you
I know what I have to do
I know I can leave this world behind
No need to feel ashamed
When theres nothing to be gained
When your dreams are in the past
Like stars we crush and burn
Only to return
These lines are change so fast
Sometimes I forget all I will regret
When I leave this world behind
And sometimes Im not sure
What Im fighting for
It happens all the time
It happens all the time
It happens all the timeWelcome to my world
Step right through the door
Leave your tranquilizers at home
You dont need them anymore
All the drama queens have gone
And the devil got dismayed
He backed up and fled this town
His master plan delayed
And if you stay a while
Ill penetrate your soul
Ill bleed into your dreams
Youll want to lose control
Ill weep into your eyes
Ill make your vision sing
Ill open endless skies
And ride your broken wings
Welcome to my world
Welcome to my world
Welcome to my world
Watch the sunrise set
And the moon begin to blush
Our naked innocence
Translucently too much
And I hold you in my arms
I keep you by my side
And we sleep the devils sleep
Just to keep him satisfied
And if you stay a while
Ill penetrate your soul
Ill bleed into your dreams
Youll want to lose control
Ill weep into your eyes
Ill make your vision sing
Ill open endless skies
And ride your broken wings
Welcome to my world
Welcome to my world
Welcome to my worldwhenever im alone with you
you makeme feel like i am home againSlow slow
Slow as you can go
So I can feel all I want to know
Slow slow
I go with your flow
Let the world keep its carnival pace
Id prefer to look into your beautiful face
What a waste
And the starts continue to fly by
I dont have one desire to understand why
I dont try
Slow slow
Slow as you can go
I want my sense to overflow
Slow slow
It doesnt show
I dont need a race in my bed
When speeds in my heart and speeds in my head
Instead
Its tempting for fools to rush in
When somethings so good why should we rush and fail
Its the same
Slow slow
Slow as you can go
Thats how I like it
I like it
I dont need a race in my bed
When speeds in my heart and speeds in my head
Instead
Slow slow
Slow as you can go
Thats how I like it
I like it
Thats how I like it
Thats how I like itThe angel of love was upon me
And Lord I felt so small
The legs beneath me weakened
I began to crawl
Confused and contented
I slithered around
Reveal is beyond me
I was lost I was found
The angel of love was upon me
And Lord I felt so weak
I felt my tongue move in my mouth
And I began to speak
A strange kind of language
I dont understand
A babbling fountain
I couldnt have planned
Oh leave me here forever more
I found the peace Ive been searching for
The angel of love was upon me
And Lord I felt so high
I swear I could have reached up
Placed my hands upon the sky
A radiant rainbow
Was following me around
With elevated senses
I can see and taste sound
The angel of love was upon me
And Lord I felt so clean
Like a preacher on Sunday
My heart was serene
I waded into the water
I was bathed I was drowned
Like the sinners before me
I knelt down on the ground
Oh leave me here forever more
I found the peace Ive been searching for
Oh let me sleep forever more
I found the peace Ive been searching forVerse one
Sometimes I slide away silently
I slowly lose myself over and over
Take comfort in my skin endlessly
Surrender to my will forever and ever
Chorus
I dissolve in trust
I will sing with joy
I will end up dust
Im in heaven
I stand in golden rays radiantly
I burn a fire of love over and over
Reflecting endless light relentlessly
I have embraced the flame forever and ever
I will scream the word
Jump into the void
I will guide the herd
Up to heavenI was there when you needed me most
I was there when you wanted me least
I was your father your son
And your holy ghost and priest
Through your failures and success
Through your losses and gains
I didnt see much happiness or pain
I couldnt save your soul
I couldnt even take you home
I couldnt fill that hole
Alone
I saw you at your best
I knew you at your worst
I couldnt tell if you were blessed or cursed
Theres a thin grey line
Between the black and white
Its evidently hard to find at night
I couldnt save your soul
I couldnt even take you home
I couldnt play that role
Alone
Now its too too late for
words That should have been said
Long ago
I was there when you needed me most
I was there when you wanted me least
I was your father your son
And your holy ghost and priest
I couldnt save your soul
I couldnt even take you home
I couldnt fill that hole
AloneIm human and I need to be loved like anyone else doesIt was you that stripped my soul
And threw it in the fire
And tamed it in the rapture
And filled me with desire
Now Im pure
Now Im clean
I feel good and serene
In you
There is no denying
How I have been changed
You wont hear me crying
Now misery is strange
I can dream
I can fly
Now it seems I get by
With you
Goodbye yeah
Goodbye again
I was always looking
Looking for someone
Someone to stick my hook in
And pull it out and run
Now Im caught on your line
All my thoughts are entwined
In you
Goodbye yeah
Goodbye again
If you see me walking
Through the golden gates
Then turn around stop talking
Stop and hesitate
Ill be waiting up there
With my fate in the air
For youYou wear guilt
Like shackles on your feet
Like a halo in reverse
I can feel
The discomfort in your seat
And in your head its worse
Theres a pain
A famine in your heart
An aching to be free
Cant you see
All loves luxuries
Are here for you and me
And when our worlds they fall apart
When the walls come tumbling in
Though we may deserve it
It will be worth it
Bring your chains
Your lips of tragedy
And fall into my armsIts been a while since you did something
And thats too long since you complained
Can sit around here doing nothing everyday
Youre the kind who points a finger
I understand that Im helping you
You have delusions and some spaced out fantasies
Its what you do
It leaves you all alone in the glory
Catch you down to size
You try to make you believe in all of his lies
Its been a long long long long long long time
Its been a long long long long long long time
Long time life
I talk to ever look in a mirror
I thought you know its so much more
Locked up inside that box behind your door
All your twisted conversations
When youre sitting all alone
Just remember we know your secret while you moan
It leaves you all alone in the glory
Catch you down to size
You try to make you believe in all of his lies
Its been a long long long long long long time
Its been a long long long long long long time
Long time lifeHave I got a soft touch
Have I got a soft touch
Is my radar that off
Is my radar that off
Im thinking
That youre sinking
And Ill drown
Ive got a confession
That your depression
Will take me down
Am I on the right track
Am I on the right track
Have I picked a bad time
Have I picked a bad time
Its seeming
That youre dreaming
With my eyes
But why protest
When your success
Is my prize
Oh brother give me a helping hand
Oh brother tell me you understand
Have I hit a raw nerve
Have I hit a raw nerve
Have I got a soft touch
Have I got a soft touch
Im thinking that youre sinking
And Ill drown
Ive got a suspicion
That your position Is unsound
Oh brother give me a helping hand
Oh brother tell me you understand
Have I hit a raw nerve
Have I hit a raw nerve
Have I got a soft touch
Have I got a soft touch
Have I hit a raw nerve
Have I hit a raw nerve
Have I got a soft touch
Have I got a soft touchOh Lilian
Look what youve done
Youve stripped my heart
Ripped it apart
In the name of fun
Oh Lilian
Im a poor mans son
And precious jewels
Werent found in schools
Where I came from
Pain and misery
Always hit the spot
Knowing you cant lose
What you havent got
Oh Lilian
I should have run
I should have known
Each dress you own
Is a loaded gun
Oh Lilian
Oh Lilian
I need protection
I hear your voice
And any choice
I had is gone
Oh Lilian
Once I begun
I couldnt stop
Till every drop
Of blood was sung
Pain and misery
Always hit the spot
Knowing you cant lose
What you havent got
Oh Lilian
Look what youve done
You stripped my heart
Ripped it apart
In the name of fun
Oh Lilian
Oh Lilian
Oh Lilian
Oh LilianIts instrumentalJohn the Revelator
Put him in a elevator
Take him up to the highest high
Take him up to the top where the mountains stop
Let him tell his book of lies
John the Revelator
Hes a smooth operator
Its time we cut him down to size
Take him by the hand
And put him on the stand
Let us hear his alibis
By claiming God as his only rock
Hes stealing a god from the Israelite
Stealing a god from a Muslim too
There is only one god through and through
Seven lies multiplied by seven multiplied by seven again
Seven angels with seven trumpets
Send them home on the morning train
Well whos that shouting
John the Revelator
All he ever gives us is pain
Well whos that shouting
John the Revelator
He should bow his head in shame
Bye-bye
Bye-bye
Bye-bye
Bye-bye

Whispering cosmos
Talking right to me
Unlimited endless
God breathing through me
See the microcosm
In macro vision
Our bodies moving
With pure precision
One universal celebration
One evolution
One creation
Thundering rhythm
Pounding within me
Driving me onwards
Forcing me to see
Clear and enlightening
Right there before me
Brilliantly shining
Intricate beauty
See the microcosm
In macro vision
Our bodies moving
With pure precision
One universal celebration

Need special handling
My God what have we done to You
We always try to share
The tenderest of care
Now look what we have put You through
Things get damaged
Things get broken
I thought wed manage
But words left unspoken
Left us so brittle
There was so little left to give
Angels with silver wings
Shouldnt know suffering
I wish I could take the pain for you
If God has a master plan
That only He understands
I hope its your eyes Hes seeing through
Things get damaged
Things get broken
I thought wed manage
But words left unspoken
Left us so brittle
There was so little left to give
I pray you learn to trust
Have faith in both of us
And keep room in your heart for two
Things get damaged
Things get broken
I thought wed manage
But words left unspoken
Left us so brittle
There was so little left to giveOh you sad one
Playing the Angel
Isnt so easy where youre from
Oh you wild one
Devils companion
You wont stay satisfied for long
Chorus
I dont want you to change anything you do
I dont want you to be someone else for me
Oh you dark one
Eternal outsider
Caught in the spiders web youve spun
Oh you blind one
Gentle and kind one
Seeing the world as a loaded gun
Chorus
Stay as you are the Darkest Star
Shining for me
Majestically
ChorusJust give me a reason some kind of sign
Ill need a miracle to help me this time
I heard what you said and I feel the same
I know in my heart that Ill have to change
Even the stars look brighter tonight
Nothings impossible
I still believe in love at first sight
Nothings impossible
How did we get to be this far apart
How did we get to be this far apart
I want to be with you have something to share
I want to be hear Im not there
Even the stars look brighter tonight
Nothings impossible
I still believe in love at first sight
Nothings impossible
Even the stars look brighter tonight
Nothings impossible
If you believe in love at first sight
Nothings impossible
I still believe in love at first sight
Nothings impossibleWhere were you when I fell from grace
Frozen heart an empty space
Somethings changing its in your eyes
Please dont speak youll only lie
I found treasure not where I thought
Peace of mind cant be bought
Still I believe
Chorus
I just hang on
Suffer well
Sometimes its hard
Its hard to tell
An angel led me when I was blind
I said take me back Ive changed my mind
Now I believe
From the blackest room I was torn
He called my name a love was born
So I believe
Chorus Were damaged people
Drawn together
By subtleties that we are not aware of
Disturbed souls
Playing out forever
These games that we once thought we would be scared of
When youre in my arms
The world makes sense
There is no pretense
And youre crying
When youre by my side
There is no defense
I forget to sense Im dying
Were damaged people
Praying for something
That doesnt come from somewhere deep inside us
Depraved souls
Trusting in the one thing
The one thing that this life has not denied us
When I feel the warmth of your very soul
I forget Im cold
And crying
When your lips touch mine
And I lose control
I forget Im old
And dyingIm not sure what Im looking for anymore
I just know that Im harder to console
I dont see who Im trying to be instead of me
But the key is a question of control
Can you say what youre trying to play anyway
I just pay while youre breaking all the rules
All the signs that I find have been underlined
Devils thrive on the drive that is fueled
Chorus
All this running around well its getting me down
Just give me a pain that Im used to
I dont need to believe all the dreams you conceive
You just need to achieve something that rings true
Theres a hole in your soul like an animal
With no conscience repentance oh no
Close your eyes pay the price for your paradise
Devils feed on the seeds of the soul
I cant conceal what I feel what I know is real
No mistaking the faking I care
With a prayer in the air I will leave it there
On a note full of hope not despair
Chorus I see a river
Its oceans that I want
You have to give me everything
But everythings not enough
Its my desire
To give myself to you
Sometimes
Sometimes I try
Sometimes I lie with you
Sometimes I cry
Sometimes I die its true
Somewhere I find something thats kind in you
And Ive crossed the line again
A line I drew in sand
And still you give me everything
But everythings not enough
Im ready but not willing
To give myself to you
Sometimes
Come on over lay down beside me
And Ill try
Come on over lay down beside me
And Ill try
And Ill try
I want it allChorus
If I could just hide
The sinner inside
And keep him denied
How sweet life would be
If I could be free
From the sinner in me
Ill never be a saint
Thats not a picture that your memory paints
Not renowned for my patience
Im not renowned for my restraint
But youre always around
You can always be found
To pick me up when Im on the ground
Chorus
Im still recovering
Still getting over all the suffering
More known for my anger
Than for any other thing
But youve always tried
To be by my side
And catch my fall when I start to slideIve got to get to you first
Before they do
Its just a question of time
Before they lay their hands on you
And make you just like the rest
Ive got to get to you first
Its just a question of time
Well now youre only fifteen
And you look good
Ill take you under my wing
Somebody should
Theyve persuasive ways
And youll believe what they say
Its just a question of time
Its running out for you
It wont be long until youll do
Exactly what they want you to
I can see them now
Hanging around
To mess you up
To strip you down
And have their fun
With my little one
Its just a question of time
Its running out for you
It wont be long until youll do
Exactly what they want you to
Sometimes I dont blame them
For wanting you
You look good
And they need something to do
Until I look at you
And then I condemn them
I know my kind
What goes on in our minds
Its just a question of time
It should be better
Its just a question of time
It should be better with you
Its just a question of timeIm waiting for the night to fall
I know that it will save us all
When everythings dark
Keeps us from the stark reality
Im waiting for the night to fall
When everything is bearable
And there in the still
All that you feel is tranquillity
There is a star in the sky
Guiding my way with its light
And in the glow of the moon
Know my deliverance will come soon
Im waiting for the night to fall
I know that it will save us all
When everythings dark
Keeps us from the stark reality
Im waiting for the night to fall
When everything is bearable
And there in the still
All that you feel is tranquillity
There is a sound in the calm
Someone is coming to harm
I press my hands to my ears
Its easier here just to forget fear
And when I squinted
The world seemed rose-tinted
And angels appeared to descend
To my surprise
With half-closed eyes
Things looked even better
Than when they were open
Been waiting for the night to fall
I knew that it would save us all
Now everythings dark
Keeps us from the stark reality
Been waiting for the night to fall
Now everything is bearable
And here in the still
All that you feel is tranquilityShes dressed in black again
And Im falling down again
Down to the floor again
Im begging for more again
But oh what can you do
When shes dressed in black
My mind wanders endlessly
On paths where shes leading me
With games that she likes to play
And words that she doesnt say
Not when were alone
And shes dressed in black
As a picture of herself
Shes a picture of the world
A reflection of you
A reflection of me
And its all there to see
If you only give in
To the fire within
Dressed in black again
Shadows fall onto me
And she stands there over me
And waits to encompass me
I lay here helplessly
But oh what can you do
When shes dressed in black
Dressed in black againMy little girl
Drive anywhere
Do what you want
I dont care
Tonight
Im in the hands of fate
I hand myself
Over on a plate
Now
Oh little girl
There are times when I feel
I rather not be
The one behind the wheel
Come
Pull my strings
Watch me move
I do anything
Please
Sweet little girl
I prefer
You behind the wheel
And me the passenger
Drive
Im yours to keep
Do what you want
Im going cheap
Tonight
Youre behind the wheel tonightCome with me
Into the trees
Well lay on the grass
And let the hours pass
Take my hand
Come back to the land
Lets get away
Just for one day
Let me see you
Stripped down to the bone
Let me see you
Stripped down to the bone
Metropolis
Has nothing on this
Youre breathing in fumes
I taste when we kiss
Take my hand
Come back to the land
Where everythings ours
For a few hours
Let me see you
Stripped down to the bone
Let me see you
Stripped down to the bone
Let me hear you
Make decisions
Without your television
Let me hear you speaking
Just for me
Let me see you
Stripped down to the bone
Let me hear you speaking
Just for me
Let me see you
Stripped down to the bone
Let me hear you crying
Just for meDeath is everywhere
There are flies on the windscreen
For a start
Reminding us
We could be torn apart
Tonight
Death is everywhere
There are lambs for the slaughter
Waiting to die
And I can sense
The hours slipping by
Tonight
Come here
Kiss me
Now
Come here
Kiss me
Now
Death is everywhere
The more I look
The more I see
The more I feel
A sense of urgency
Tonight
Come here
Touch me
Kiss me
Touch me
Now
Touch me
Touch me
There are flies on the windscreen
There are lambs for the slaughter
There are flies on the windscreen
Come here
Touch me
Kiss me
Touch me
Now
Touch me
Touch meWords like violence
Break the silence
Come crashing in
Into my little world
Painful to me
Pierce right through me
Cant you understand
Oh my little girl
All I ever wanted
All I ever needed
Is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm
Vows are spoken
To be broken
Feelings are intense
Words are trivial
Pleasures remain
So does the pain
Words are meaningless
And forgettable
All I ever wanted
All I ever needed
Is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm
All I ever wanted
All I ever needed
Is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm
All I ever wanted
All I ever needed
Is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm
Enjoy the silenceHere is a song from the wrong side of town
Where Im bound to the ground by the loneliest sound
And it pounds from within and is pinning me down
Here is a page from the emptiest stage
A cage or the heaviest cross ever made
A gauge of the deadliest trap ever laid
And I thank you for bringing me here
For showing me home
For singing these tears
Finally Ive found that I belong here
The heat and the sickliest sweet smelling sheets
That cling to the backs of my knees and my feet
Well Im drowning in time to a desperate beat
And I thank you for bringing me here
For showing me home
For singing these tears
Finally Ive found that I belong
Feels like home
I should have known
From my first breath
God send the only true friend I call mine
Pretend that Ill make amends the next time
Befriend the glorious end of the line
And I thank you for bringing me here
For showing me home
For singing these tears
Finally Ive found that I belong hereAnd do those feet in modern times
Walk upon the flowers
And walk upon their brothers
While their heads are busy lying low
Trying to keep to coveroh
Something went wrong
Along the way
Everybodys waiting for
Judgment day
So they can go
Told you so
Bring me my gun of itching desire
Bring me my bullets and I will fire
Sights set higher than the tall church spire
Standing in line
The blind lead the blind
Waiting and waiting
For an overdue sign
Brothers and sisters
Playing Chinese whispers
If things arent suited
Then theyll get diluted
Theres one more dead with a hole in his head
He shouldnt have said all the things he said
Many tears were shed for the blood he bledEverybodys looking for someone to follow
Finding the whole thing hard to swallow
Everybodys looking for a reason to live
If youre looking for a reason Ive a reason to give
Pleasure little treasure
Everybodys looking for a new sensation
Everybodys talking about the state of the nation
Everybodys searching for a promised land
Everybodys failing to understand
Pleasure little treasure
Everybodys looking for a reason to live
If youre looking for a reason
Ive a reason to give
Pleasure little treasure
Maternity frocks and paternity suits
If thats what you want
Theyre waiting for you
Everybody needs some reason or other
Youll find a reason when you discover
Pleasure little treasureJohn the Revelator

New day turn away
Wipe away the tear

And I like the way you straighten my tie
And I like the way youre winking your eye
And I know I like you

I hope he never lets me down again
He knows where hes taking me
Taking me where I want to be

Were watching the world pass us by
Never want to come down
Never want to put my feet back down
On the ground
Im taking a ride
With my best friend
I hope he never lets me down again
Promises me Im as safe as houses
As long as I remember whos wearing the trousers
I hope he never lets me down again
Never let me down
See the stars theyre shining bright

That I find myself
I find myself
Its only when I lose myself in someone else
That I find myself
I find myself
Something beautiful is happening inside for me
Something sensual its full of fire and mystery
I feel hypnotized I feel paralyzed
I have found heaven
Theres a thousand reasons
Why I shouldnt spend my time with you
For every reason not to be here I can think of two
Keep me hanging on
Feeling nothings wrong
Inside your heaven
Its only when I lose myself in someone else
That I find myself
I find myself
Its only when I lose myself in someone else
That I find myself
I find myself
I can feel the emptiness inside me fade and disappear
Theres a feeling of contentment now that you are here
I feel satisfied
I belong inside
Your velvet heaven
Did I need to sell my soul
For pleasure like this
Did I have to lose control
To treasure your kiss
Did I need to place my heart
In the palm of your hand
Before I could even start
To understand
Its only when I lose myself in someone else
That I find myself
I find myself
Its only when I lose myself in someone else
That I find myself
I find myselfMy secret gardens not so secret anymore
Run from the house holding my head in my hands
Feeling dejected feeling like a child might feel
It all seems so absurd
That this should have occurred
My very only secret
And I had to go and leak it
My secret gardens not so secret anymore
No my secret gardens not so secret anymore
Run through the fields down to the edge of the water
Cant stay long here comes the reason why
Shell catch me if she can
Take me by the hand
Ill have to keep on running
And I just cant see the fun in
My secret garden not being secret anymore
It used to be so easy
On days such as these shed
Search and search for hours
In among the flowers
I loved it I loved her
Play the fool act so cruel I loved it
Read her book take a look I loved her
It all seems so absurd
That this should have occurred
My very only secret
And I had to go and leak it
My secret gardens not so secret anymoreInstrumentalLike a cat dragged in from the rain
Who goes straight back out and do i all over again
Ill be back for more
Something that is out of our hands
Something we will never understand
Its a hidden law
The apple falls
Destiny calls
I follow you
Like a pawn on the eternal board
Whos never quite sure what hes moved towards
I walk blindly on
And heaven is in front of me
Your heaven beckons me enticingly
When I arrive its gone
The river flows
The wise man knows
I follow you
Im yearning Im burning
I feel loves wheels turning
Like a moth on loves bright light
I will get burned each and every night
Im dying to
The sun will shine
The bottom line
I follow you
Im yearning Im burning
I feel loves wheels turning
Like a moth on loves bright light
I will get burned each and every night
Im dying too
The sun will shine
The bottom line
I follow you
The sun will shine
The bottom line
I follow youPut up the barriers
Shut down your senses
Cover up with all of your pretenses
See no evil
Your eyes are blunted
We are the hunters
We are the hunted
Place it in your memory
Leave it in your past
But dont forget
Taking a tumble
Im taking a dive
Sometimes I stumble when my minds made up
Reaction levels
Seem strangely muted
Ordinary acts of fun have been diluted
Place it in your memory
Leave it in your past
But dont forgetTry to forget torment
Lying behind a smile
Tears for sentiment
Now Ive done my time
You filled my head with your opinions
Blind to your lies I listened
Still waiting for love to take revenge revenge
For that sweet surrender
Youll get what you deserve
Hiding behind a lie
Revenge says more than words
Youll pay for your crime
I fooled myself youd change your ways
Blind to your lies I listened
Still waiting for love to take revenge revenge
For that sweet surrender
Still waiting for love to take revenge
For that sweet surrender
Still waiting for love to take revenge
For that sweet surrender
Still waiting for love to take revenge revenge
For that sweet surrender
Still waiting for love to take revenge
For that sweet surrender
Still waiting for love to take revenge revenge
Still waiting for love
Still waiting for love to take revenge
Waiting for love from heaven
Still waiting for love to take revenge
Still waiting for love
To take revenge
Sweet revenge
Waiting for love from heavenSister of night
When the hunger descends
And your bodys a fire
An inferno that never ends
An eternal flame
That burns in desires name
Sister of night
When the longing returns
Giving voice to the flame
Calling you through flesh that burns
Breaking down your will
To move in for the kill
Oh sister come for me
Embrace me assure me
Hey sister I feel it too
Sweet sister just feel me
Im trembling you heal me
Hey sister I feel it too
Sister of night
In your saddest dress
As you walk through the light
Youre desperate to impress
So you slide to the floor
Feeling insecure
Sister of night
With the loneliest eyes
Tell yourself its alright
Hell make such a perfect prize
But the cold light of day
Will give the game away
Oh sister come for me
Embrace me assure me
Hey sister I feel it too
Sweet sister just feel me
Im trembling you heal me
Hey sister I feel it tooMy little girl
Drive anywhere
Do what you want
I dont care
Tonight
Im in the hands of fate
I hand myself
Over on a plate
Now
Oh little girl
There are times when I feel
Id rather not be
The one behind the wheel
Come
Pull my strings
Watch me move
I do anything
Please
Sweet little girl
I prefer
You behind the wheel
And me the passenger
Drive
Im yours to keep
Do what you want
Im going cheap
Tonight
Youre behind the wheel tonightSet me free
Set me free
Remotivate me
Set me burning
After years in deep freeze
My body is yearning
For a new lease of life
And a little spice
Set me free
Remotivate me
Give me a reason
To scream and shout
Give me something
To get excited about
When everything is looking dull
Im sure it isnt impossible to
Set me free
Remotivate me
Remotivate me
Set me burning
After years in deep freeze
My body is yearning
For a new lease of life
And a little spice
Set me free
Remotivate meFeel the seas
So vitalizes
Its talking to me
Loud and clearly
And as you see
Theres something to say
Feel the clouds that are not essential
It is re-endless
Retries my patience
But never less is all I could say
We can see the
There will be so
Well be ignorant
Or disobedient
And never say that
This is real fun
This is funShe remembered all the shadows and the doubts
The same film
Vivid pictures like a wall thats standing empty
And the night so still
Such a small affair a relapse someone closing
Like the nightclub door
Here again and when you speak I watch you move away
And seem so sure
She is hoping to forget and the moment
Almost slips away
When the colors move apart and I wonder
If you want to stay
And I need to change you like the words Im reading
Dont you understand
This the warning and the message I remember
As you touch my handFame
Can have strange effects
Money
Can have strange effects
I ask myself
Is it a sin
To be flexible
When the boat comes in
Open the window and out go ideals
Drink
Can alter you
Girls
Can have strange effects tooInstrumentalWere lying by the orange sky
Two million miles across the land
Scattered to the highest high
Expect theyll either laugh or cry
No sex no consequence no sympathy
Youre good enough to heat
Two minute warning
Two minutes later
When time has come
My days are numbered
The dawning of another year
Marks time for those who understand
One in four still here
While you and I go hand in hand
No radio no sound no sin no sanctuary
So welcome to your last
The sun the solitude the cemetery
So welcome to your lastI cant help it Im not sure what to do
Does seem crazy no good for my health
Ive seen the doctor hes come to look at me
If you dont believe it dont believe
Closer all the time Closer all the time
Closer all the time Closer all the time
Now Im saying how Im going to need a pill
I need you like a drug to keep my fill
I cant remember everything I do
Now I put them its only good to you
Closer all the time Closer all the time
Closer all the time Closer all the time
You cant help but look me in the eye
While I come running I dont know why
Its an addiction image of love
Your heart pushing angel from above
Closer all the time Closer all the time
Closer all the time Closer all the time
Closer all the time Closer all the time
CloseYou can see them running through me babe
You can see the lights in their eyes
You can see the masses raising me
And Im preaching them more lies
Im just a mass-form communication
I sell what everyone buys
Do you know my appearance is changing
Changing from my disguise
Im just a television set
Im just a television set
Im just a television set
You can have me babe if you want me
Just plug me into your wall
And Ill give you sex if you want it
Or Ill give you nothing at all
You can have me babe for good times
You can have me babe for bad
Keep me running all of your life and
Ill turn your instant demand
Im just a television set
Im just a television set
Im just a television set
Did you see them running through me babe
Did you see the lights in their eyes
Did you see the masses raising me
Am I preaching them more lies
Im just a mass-form communication
I sell what everyone buys
Do you know my appearance is changing
Changing from my disguise
Im just a television set
Im just a television set
Im just a television setI can hear your soul crying
Listen to your spirit sighing
I can feel your desperation
Emotional deprivation
Let yourself go
Let yourself go
Let your feelings show
Picking up the conversations
Deep in your imagination
Tune in to the lonely voices
Talking of their only choices
Let yourself go
Let yourself go
Let your spirit grow
Step out of your cage and onto the stage
Its time to start playing your part
Freedom awaits
Open the gates
Open your mind
Freedoms a state
I can taste the tears falling
The bitterness thats inside you calling
Yearning for a liberation
Emotional emancipation
Let yourself go
Let yourself go
Let your senses overflow
Step out of your cage and onto the stage
Its time to start playing your part
Freedom awaits
Open the gates
Open your mind
Freedoms a stateGet out the crane
Construction time again
What is it this time
Were laying a pipeline
Let the beads of sweat flow
Until the ends have met through
Could take a long time
Working on the pipeline
Taking from the greedy
Giving to the needy
On this golden day
Works been sent our way
That could last a lifetime
Working on the pipeline
From the heart of our land
To the mouth of the man
Must reach him sometime
Were laying a pipeline
Taking from the greedy
Giving to the needyOh the tears that you weep
For the poor tortured souls
Who fall at your feet
With their love begging bowls
All the clerks and the tailors
The sharks and the sailors
All good at their trades
Theyll always be failures
Alms for the poor
For the wretched disciples
And the love that they swore
With their hearts on the bible
Beseeching the honor
To sit at your table
And feast on your holiness
As long as theyre able
Love needs its martyrs
Needs its sacrifices
They live for your beauty
And pay for their vices
Love will be the death of
My lonely soul brothers
But their spirit shall live on in
The hearts of all lovers
Your holding court
With your lips and your smile
Your bodys a halo
Their minds are on trial
Sure as Adam is Eve
Sure as Jonah turned whaler
Theyre crooked love thieves
And you are their jailer
Love needs its martyrs
Needs its sacrifices
They live for your beauty
And pay for their vices
Love will be the death of
My lonely soul brothers
But their spirit shall live on in
The hearts of all others
Love will be the death of
My lonely soul brothers
But their spirit shall live on in
The hearts of all othersSet me free
Set me free
Remotivate me
Set me burning
After years in deep freeze
My body is yearning
For a new lease of life
And a little spice
Set me free
Remotivate me
Give me a reason
To scream and shout
Give me something
To get excited about
When everything is looking dull
Im sure it isnt impossible to
Set me free
Remotivate me
Remotivate me
Set me burning
After years in deep freeze
My body is yearning
For a new lease of life
And a little spice
Set me free
Remotivate meYouve got to work hard
Youve got to work hard
If you want anything at all
Nothing comes easy
And thats a fact
Nothing comes easy
But a broken back
Nothing comes easy
It never will
Nothing comes easy
But a broken will
So work hardThis is an insight
Into my life
This is a strange flight
Im taking
My true will
Carries me along
This is a soul dance
Embracing me
This is the first chance
To put things right
Moving on
Guided by the light
And the spirit of love
Is rising within me
Talking to you now
Telling you clearly
The fire still burns
Wisdom of ages
Rush over me
Heighten my senses
Enlighten me
Lead me on
Eternally
And the spirit of love
Is rising within me
Talking to you now
Telling you clearly
The fire still burns
Im talking to you now
The fire still burns
Whatever you do now
The world still turnsSaturday night you look so chic
Been waiting for this moment been waiting all week
The pub is crowded much too hot
The boys theyre dancing they just cant stop
Tomorrows dance tomorrows dance
You dance your dance you dance your chance
Tomorrows dance tomorrows dance
You dance with pride and you dance with pride
Ice cold drinks get sold tonight
Were gonna get happy the occasion is right
You start to move you take the floor
The music is better than ever before
Tomorrows dance tomorrows dance
You dance your dance you dance your chance
Tomorrows dance tomorrows dance
You dance with pride and you dance with pride
three AM I just cant last
The music is loud and much too fast
You cannot get out you wanna stay
You gotta hang out another dancing day
Tomorrows dance tomorrows dance
You dance your dance you dance your chance
Tomorrows dance tomorrows dance
You dance with pride and you dance with prideNot now pressing tight
Children run the mothers cry
All my dreams are wasting now
No more reason I see this now
As I watch you from the road
My mind did open the reason man
My mind did open reason man
Government amusement theres something to say
Propaganda only today
They need someone known to hear
Manipulation is all to fear
Things were edging to the rise
See him laughing the reason man
See him laughing reason man
Everyone infected is paranoid
Old before the time
Blessed with the feeling well go grey
Shadow monsters will feed the flame
Theyre just calling its a rise
Now hes sending the reason man
Now hes sending reason manInstrumentalDo you mean this horny creep
Set upon weary feet
Who looks in need of sleep
That doesnt come
This twisted tortured mess
This bed of sinfulness
Whos longing for some rest
And feeling numb
What do you expect of me
What is it you want
Whatever youve planned for me
Im not the one
A vicious appetite
Visits me each night
And wont be satisfied
Wont be denied
An unbearable pain
A beating in my brain
That leaves the mark of Cain
Right here inside
What am I supposed to do
When everything that Ive done
Is leading me to conclude
Im not the one
Whatever Ive done
Ive been staring down the Barrel of a Gun
Is there something you need from me
Are you having your fun
I never agreed to be
Your Holy One
Whatever Ive done
Ive been staring down the Barrel of a GunWhen the site was found
We laid the foundations down
It didnt take long before
They came back tumbling down
Dont build at night
You need a little light
How else are you going to see
What it is going to be like
So we picked up our tools
And we worked in the morning light
With the last stone placed
Wasnt it a wonderful site
But it fell back down
And scattered all around
Anything passes
When you need glasses
My monument
It feel down
My monument
It feel down
Work all of my days for this kind of praise
It fell down
Work all of my days
It fell downCelebrate the fact
That weve see the back
Of another black day
Black day
Black day
I want to take you in my arms
Forgeting all I couldnt do today
Black day
Black dayPlans made in the nursery
Can change the course of history
Remember that
Mummys annoyed says go and play
Dont show your face
Stay away all day
Shouldnt have done that
A small boy and his infantry
Marching around so naturally
Shouldnt have done that
Grows up and goes to school
Such a nice boy
Obeys all the rules
Mummys proud of thatDont know the reason why I
Think Ive been here before
This place seems so familiar
But then I cant be sure
Here comes that time again when
Youll walk right out the door
Dont tell me secrets anymore
And fools dont run away
Youll be followed another day
And all the chances that fall your way
Are in the fire on your dying day
So call me now and tell me that youre home
Cant see the sense in crying
Theres too many tears to fall
My thoughts are multiplying
So Ill try to save them allNow hear this my friends
Ill never be the same again
Going to lock myself in a cold black room
Going to shadow myself in a veil of gloom
I will function operate
I will be a satellite of hate
Driven to this point by a chain of events
Each one pushed me nearer the edge
Going to send my message through to you
Youll receive the signal too
I will function operate
I will be a satellite of hate
Higher Higher
Disillusioned I was disenchanted
Forgot the love that had been implanted
Heard the lies and I felt the cold
It broke my heart and I lost control
Now Im a satellite of a free state
Im a satellite of hateInstrumentalThe landscape is changing
The landscape is crying
Thousands of acres of forest are dying
Carbon copies from the hills above the forest line
Acid streams are flowing ill across the countryside
Cause I dont care if youre going nowhere
Just take good care of the world
I dont case if youre going nowhere
Just take good care of the world
Now were re-arranging
Theres no use denying
Mountains and valleys cant you hear them sighing
Evolution the solution or the certainty
Can you imagine this intrusion of their privacy
Token gestures some semblance of intelligence
Can we be blamed for the security of ignoranceSea of sin
Im swimming in
And Im taking a dive
My minds in need
So my body feeds
And it keeps me alive
It gets better and better
As it gets wetter and wetter
Sea of sin
Know where youve been
But I dont care
Sea of sin
Through thick and thin
For better or worse
My minds in need
So my body feeds
And it quenches my thirst
You look cheaper and cheaper
As we sink deeper and deeper
Sea of sin
Know where youve been
Cause Ive been there
Here under Gods sky
His watchful eye
And all of the lies
My consolation prize
Sea of sin
My second skin
My home from home
When Im in doubt
My hands reach out
And Im never alone
It gets wetter and wetter
As it gets better and better
Sea of sin
Know where youve been
And Im prepared
Sea of sin
Know where youve been
Yes Im aware
Sea of sin
Know where youve been
Cause Ive been there
Sea of sin
Know where youve been
And I dont care
Sea of sin
Know where youve been
And I dont careNothing on this
I taste when we kiss
Come back to the land
For a few hours
Let me see you
Stripped down to the bone
Taste when we kiss
I taste when we kiss
Youre breathing in fumes
I taste when we kiss
Let me see you
Stripped down to the
I taste when we kiss
I taste when we kiss
Let me see you
Stripped down to the
Come back to the land
Come back to the land
Let me see you
Stripped down to the bone
Breathing in fumes
Im breathing in fumes
Breathing in fumes
Youre breathing in fumesInstrumentalInstrumentalHappiest girl I ever knew
Happiest girl I ever knew
Wanted to feel the joy
Flow between our lips
Wanted to feel the joy
Flow between our hips
Happiest girl I ever knew
Why do you smile the smile you do
Happiest girl I ever knew
Wanted to feel the joy
Pass between our eyes
Wanted to feel the joy
Pass between our thighs
And I would have to pinch her
Just to see if she was real
Just to watch the smile fade away
And see the pain shed feel
Wanted to feel her joy
Feel it deep within
Wanted to feel her joy
Penetrate my skin
Happiest girl I ever knew
Why do you smile the smile you doWine is sweet and gin is bitter
Drink all you can but you wont forget her
You talk too much you laugh too loud
You see her face in every crowd
Thats the price of love the price of love
A debt you pay with tears and pain
The price of love the price of love
It costs you more when youre to blame
Kiss one girl kiss another
Kiss them all but you wont recover
Youre dancing slow youre dancing fast
Youre happy now but that wont last
Thats the price of love the price of love
A debt you pay with tears and pain
The price of love the price of love
It costs you more when youre to blameIve been a martyr for love
And I will die in the flames
As I draw my last breath
As Im closing on death
I will call out your name
Ive been a martyr for love
Nailed up on the cross
While youre having your fun
As the damage is done
Im assessing the cost
I knew what I was letting myself in for
I knew that I could never even the score
Ive been a martyr for love
I need to be by your side
I have knelt at your feet
I have felt your deceit
Couldnt leave if I tried
Ive been a martyr for love
Tortured every hour
From the day I was born
Ive been moved like a pawn
By the greatest of powers
I knew that I would have to suffer in vain
Aware that I would never outgrow the pain
Ive been a martyr for love
Ive been a martyr for love
Ive been a martyr for loveInstrumentalThe things you do
Arent good for my health
The moves you make
You make for yourself
The means you use
Arent meant to confuse
Although they do
Theyre the ones that I would choose
And I wouldnt want it any other way
You wouldnt let me anyway
Dangerous
The way you leave me wanting more
Dangerous
Thats what I want you for
Dangerous
When I am in your arms
Dangerous
Know I will come to harm
The lies you tell
Arent meant to deceive
Theyre not there
For me to believe
Ive heard
Your vicious words
You know by now
It takes a lot to see me hurtI was born with the wrong sign
In the wrong house
With the wrong ascendancy
I took the wrong road
That led to the wrong tendencies
I was in the wrong place at the wrong time
For the wrong reason and the wrong rhyme
On the wrong day of the wrong week
I used the wrong method with the wrong technique
Wrong
Wrong
Theres something wrong with me chemically
Something wrong with me inherently
The wrong mix in the wrong genes
I reached the wrong ends by the wrong means
It was the wrong plan
In the wrong hands
With the wrong theory for the wrong man
The wrong lies on the wrong vibes
The wrong questions with the wrong replies
Wrong
Wrong
I was marching to the wrong drum
With the wrong scum
Pissing out the wrong energy
Using all the wrong lines
And the wrong signs
With the wrong intensity
I was on the wrong page of the wrong book
With the wrong rendition of the wrong hook
Made the wrong move every wrong night
With the wrong tune played till it sounded right yeah
Wrong
Wrong
Too long
Wrong
I was born with the wrong sign
In the wrong house
With the wrong ascendancy
I took the wrong road
That led to the wrong tendencies
I was in the wrong place at the wrong time
For the wrong reason and the wrong rhyme
On the wrong day of the wrong week
I used the wrong method with the wrong technique

Ive been a martyr for loveTheres something beating here inside my body
And its called a heart
You know how easy it is to tear it apart
If I lend it to you would you keep it safe for me
Ill lend it to you will you treat it tenderly
Theres something beating here inside my body
And its called a heart
Theres a sun shining in the sky
But thats not the reason why Im feeling warm inside
The answer isnt classified- its my heart
From the moment I started
I tried to be good about it
Yes Ive tried my best
And more or less I spoke from my heart
Theres a lot to be learned
And you learn when your heart gets burned
Theres something beating here inside my body
And its called a heart
You know how easy it is to tear it apart
If I lend it to you would you keep it safe for me
Ill lend it to you will you treat it tenderly
Theres something beating here inside my body
And its called a heart
Hearts can never be owned
Hearts only come on loan
If I want it back
I will take it back
Ill take my heart
But I will try my best
And more or less
I will speak from my heart
Yes I will speak from my heart
Speak from my heart
Theres a lot to be learned
And you learn when your heart gets burned
Theres something beating here inside my body
And its called a heart
You know how easy it is to tear it apart
If I lend it to you would you keep it safe for me
Ill lend it to you will you treat it tenderly
Theres something beating here inside my body
And its called a heartInstrumentalDo you ever get that feeling
When the guilt begins to hurt
Seeing all the children
Wallowing in dirt
Crying out with hunger
Crying out in pain
At least the dirt will wash off
When it starts to rain
Soap wont wash away your shame
Do you ever get that feeling
That something isnt right
Seeing your brothers fists
Clenched ready for the fight
Soon the fighting turns to weapons
And the weapons turn to wounds
So the doctors stitch and stitch
And stitch and stitch and stitch
And stitch and stitch
Surgery wont improve your pain
It all seems so stupid
It makes me want to give up
But why should I give up
When it all seems so stupid
Do you ever get the feeling
That something can be done
To eradicate these problems
And make the people one
Do you ever get that feeling
Something like a nagging itch
And all the while the doctors
Stitch and stitch and stitch
And stitch and stitch
Hope alone wont remove the stains
ShameJohn the Revelator
Put him in a elevator
Take him up to the highest high
Take him up to the top where the mountains stop
Let him tell his book of lies
John the Revelator
Hes a smooth operator
Its time we cut him down to size
Take him by the hand
And put him on the stand
Let us hear his alibis
By claiming God as his only rock
Hes stealing a god from the Israelite
Stealing a god from a Muslim too
There is only one god through and through
Seven lies multiplied by seven multiplied by seven again
Seven angels with seven trumpets
Send them home on the morning train
Well whos that shouting
John the Revelator
All he ever gives us is pain
Well whos that shouting
John the Revelator
He should bow his head in shame
Bye-bye

John the RevelatorIve read more than a hundred books
Seeing love mentioned many thousand times
But despite all the places Ive looked
Its still no clearer
Im still no nearer
The meaning of love
Noted down all my observations
Spent an evening watching television
Still I couldnt say with precision
Know its a feeling and it comes from above
But whats the meaning
The meaning of love
tell me
From the notes that Ive made so far
Love seems something like wanting a scar
Well I could be wrong
Im just not sure you see
Ive never been in love before
Next I asked several friends of mine
If they could spare a few minutes of their time
Their looks suggested that Ive lost my mind
Tell me the answer
My Lord high above
Tell me the meaning
The meaning of love
From the notes that Ive made so far
Love seems something like wanting a scar
Well I could be wrong
Im just not sure you see
Ive never been in love before
The meaning of love
tell me
Tell me the meaning of love
tell meWell Im knocking on Deaths door
Will I take my rest among the blessed
Mother are you waiting
Father are you pacing
Im coming home
Im knocking on Deaths door
Will I take my rest in my Sunday best
Mother are you anxious
Father are you gracious
Im coming home
Ive been away too long
For so long youve been strong
Ive been away too long
I know that it was wrong
But Im coming home
Well Im knocking on Deaths door
Will I take my rest have I passed the test
Mother are you praying
Father I am saying
Im coming homeJohn the Revelator

Every time I look at it
It makes me feel blue
What use is a souvenir
Of something we once had
When all it ever does is
Make me feel bad
I wish I could tear it up
But then again I havent the guts
I wish I could throw it on the fire
I wish I could
But to say I would
Id be a liar
What good is a color print
Of a little baby doll
When just one little glance
Is enough to make me feel dullInstrumentalIce Machine
Running through my head secretly
The shout of the boys in the factory
Ill ring you on the telephone silently
Like blood like wine in the darkroom scene
Darkroom scene
A letter once composed
Seven years long
And as tall as a tree
Written on the wall efficient
Efficiency
Resurrect as a feeling on my window
Of a past reunion
Resurrect as a feeling on my window
Of a past reunion
Mission of a picture like the city and the air we breathe
The air we breathe
Air we breathe
She stood beside me once again
I knew her face
We met before in the street
Recalling all the children dancing at our feet
Their dancing feet
Dancing feetAll of these insurmountable tasks
That lay before me
All of the firsts and the definite lasts
That lay in store for me
There was a time
When all on my mind was love
Now I find that most of the time
Loves not enough in itself
Consequently Ive a tendency to be unhappy
You see the thoughts in my head
All the words that were said
All the blues and the reds get to me
There was a time
When all on my mind was love
Now I find that most of the time
Loves not enough in itself
All of these absurdities
That lay before us
All of the doubts and the certainties
That lay in store for us
There was a time
When all on my mind was love love love love
Now I find that most of the time
Loves not enough in itselfGlitter Mix

Everybodys looking for a new sensation
Everybodys talking about the state of the nation
Everybodys looking for a promised land
Everybodys failing to understand

SONG SEA OF SIN -- Released on single with World in My Eyes
Sea of Sin Im spinning in and Im taking a dive
My minds in need so my body feeds and it keeps me alive
It gets better and better as it gets wetter and wetter
Sea of Sin know where youve been but I dont care
Sea of Sin through thick and thin oh and betting with words
My minds in need so my body feeds and it quenches my thirst
You look cheaper and cheaper as we sink deeper and deeper
Sea of Sin know where youve been cause Ive been there
Here under Gods fire
His watchful eye
And all of the lies
My consolation prize
Sea of Sin my second skin my other home
when Im in doubt my hands reach out and Im never alone
It gets wetter and wetter as it gets better and better
Sea of Sin know where youve been and Im prepared
Sea of Sin know where youve been yes Im aware
Sea of Sin know where youve been cause Ive been there
Sea of Sin know where youve been and I dont care
Sea of Sin know where youve been and I dont careLets take a map of the world
Tear it into pieces
All of the boys and the girls
Will see how easy it is
Chorus
To put it all down and start again
From the top to the bottom and then
Ill have faith or I prefer
To think that things couldnt turn out worse
All that we need at the starts
Universal revolution thats all
And if we trust in our hearts
Well find the solutions
Chorus
Took a plane across the world
Got in a car
And when I reached my destination
I hadnt gone far
Lets take the whole of the world
The mountains and the sand
Let all the boys and the girls
Shape it in their hands
ChorusAll I want to do is see you again
Is that too much to ask for
I just want to see your sweet smile
Smile the way it was before
Well Ill try not to hold you
And Ill try not to kiss you
And I wont even touch you
All I want to do is see you
Dont you know that its true
I remember the days when wed walk through the woods
And sit on a bench for a while
I treasure the way we used to laugh and play
And look in each others eyes
You can keep me at a distance if you dont trust my resistance
But I swear I wont touch you
All I want to do is see you
Dont you know that its true
Well I know five years is a long time
And that times change oh that times change
But I think that you will find
People are basically the same basically the same
If the waters still flowing we can go for a swim
And do the things we used to do
And if Im reluctant you can pull me in
And we can relive our youth
Oh but well stay friendly like sister and brother
Though I think I still love you
All I want to do is see you
Dont you know that its trueLots of surprises in store
This isnt a party
Its a whole lot more
Weve had enough of this blind mans bluff
Youve kept us in the dark for long enough
This is more than a party
More than a party
More than a party
Keep telling us were to have fun
Then take all the ice cream so weve got none
The failed magician waves his wand
And in an instant the laughters gone
Loads of surprises in store
This isnt a party
Its a whole lot moreSomeone will call
Something will fall
And smash on the floor
Without reading the text
Know what comes next
Seen it before
And its painful
Things must change
We must rearrange them
Or well have to estrange them
All that Im saying
A games not worth playing
Over and over again
Youre the one I like best
You retain my interest
Youre the only one
If it wasnt for you
Dont know what Id do
Unpredictable like the sun
And the rainfallReach out and touch faith
Your own personal Jesus
Someone to hear your prayers
Someone who cares
Your own personal Jesus
Someone to hear your prayers
Someone whos there
Feeling unknown
And youre all alone
Flesh and bone
By the telephone
Lift up the receiver
Ill make you a believer
Take second best
Put me to the test
Things on your chest
You need to confess
I will deliver
You know Im a forgiver
Reach out and touch faith
Reach out and touch faith
Your own personal Jesus
Someone to hear your prayers
Someone who cares
Your own personal Jesus
Someone to hear your prayers
Someone whos there
Feeling unknown
And youre all alone
Flesh and bone
By the telephone
Lift up the receiver
Ill make you a believer
I will deliver
You know Im a forgiver
Reach out and touch faith
Your own personal Jesus
Reach out and touch faith
Reach out and touch faith
Reach out and touch faith
Reach out and touch faith
Reach out and touch faith
Reach out reach out
Reach out and touch faithWe crossed the line who pushed who over
It doesnt matter to you it matters to me
Were cut adrift were still floating
Im only hangin on to watch you go down my love
I disappeared in you
You disappeared from me
I gave you everything you ever wanted
It wasnt what you wanted
The men who love you you hate the most
They pass right through you like a ghost
They look for you but your spirit is in the air
Baby youre nowhere
Oh love you say in love there are no rules
Oh love sweetheart youre so cruel
Desperation is a tender trap
It gets you every time
You put your lips to her lips
To stop the lie
Her skin is pale like Gods only dove
Screams like an angel for your love
Then she makes you watch her from above
And you need her like a drug
Oh love you say in love there are no rules
Oh love sweetheart youre so cruel
She wears my love like a see through dress
Her lips say one thing
Her movements something else
Oh love like a screaming flower
Love dying every hour love
You dont know if its fear or desire
Danger the drug that takes you higher
Head in heaven fingers in the fire
Her heart is racing you cant keep up
The night is bleeding like a cut
Between the horses of love and lust
We are trampled underfoot
Oh love you say in love there are no rules
Oh love sweetheart youre so cruel
Oh love to stay with you Id be a fool
Sweetheart youre so cruelIts the dark night of my soul
And temptations taking hold
But through the pain and the suffering
Through the heartache and trembling
Chorus
I feel loved
I feel loved
As the darkness closes in
In my head I hear whispering
Questioning and beckoning
But Im not taken in
Chorus
From the depths of my emptiness
Comes a feeling of inner bliss
I feel wanted I feel desired
I can feel my soul on fire
ChorusYou have bound my heart with subtle chains
So much pleasure that it feels like pain
So entwined now that we cant shake free
I am you and you are me
No escaping from the mess were in
So much pleasure that it must be sin
I must live with this reality
I am yours eternally
Theres no turning back
Were in this trap
No denying the facts
No no no
No excuses to give
Im the one youre with
Weve no alternative
No no no
Dark obsession in the name of love
This addiction that were both part of
Leads us deeper into mystery
Keeps us craving endlessly
Strange compulsions that I cant control
Pure possession of my heart and soul
I must live with this reality
I am you and you are me
I am you and you are me
I am you and you are me
I am you and you are me
Theres no turning back
Were in this trap
No denying the facts
No no no
No excuses to give
Im the one youre with
Weve no alternative
No no noComatose almost
Youve got me dreaming
Slipping in
And sliding out
Of conscious feeling
Take a light
Start the flame
Play the game
I am lost
In your eyes
Hypnotized
Here I believe
Dreams never deceive
Comatose almost
Youve got me dreaming
Slipping in
And sliding out
Life has no meaning
Bodies move
Colors change
Girl youre strange
Here inside
Im at home
Im alive
Dont be afraid
Im floating away
Comatose almost
Youve got me dreaming
Slipping in
And sliding out
Of conscious feeling
Comatose almost
Comatose almost
ComatoseTo the souls desires
The body listens
What the flesh requires
Keeps the heart imprisoned
What the spirit seeks
The mind will follow
When the body speaks
All else is hollow
Im just an angel
Driving blindly
Through this world
Im just a slave here
At the mercy
Of a girl
Oh I need your tenderness
Oh I need your touch
Oh I dream of one caress
Oh I pray too much
To the souls desires
The body listens
What the flesh requires
Keeps the heart imprisoned
What the spirit seeks
The mind will follow
When the body speaks
All else is hollow
You keep me waiting
For the promise
That is mine
Please stop debating
Please stop wasting
Your time
Oh I need your tenderness
Oh I need your touch
Oh I dream of one caress
Oh I pray too muchHere somewhere in the heart of me
There is still a part of me
That cares
And Ill Ill still take the best youve got
Even though Im sure its not
The best for me
When youre born a lover
Youre born to suffer
Like all soul sisters
And soul brothers
I I can see the danger signs
They only help to underline
Your beauty
Im not looking for an easy ride
True happiness cannot be tried
So easily
When youre born a lover
Youre born to suffer
Like all soul sisters
And soul brothers
Like all soul sisters
And soul brothers
You can take your time
Ill be waiting in line
You dont even have to give me
The time of day
When youre born a lover
Youre born to suffer
Like all soul sisters
And soul brothers
Like all soul sisters
And soul brothersInstrumentalCan you feel a little love
As your bony fingers close around me
Long and spindly death becomes me
Heaven can you see what I see
Hey you pale and sickly child
Youre death and living reconciled
Been walking home a crooked mile
Paying debt to karma you party for a living
What you take wont kill you
But careful what youre giving
Theres no time for hesitating
Pain is ready pain is waiting
Primed to do its educating
Unwanted uninvited kin
It creeps beneath your crawling skin
It lives without it lives within you
Feel the fever coming youre shaking and twitching
You can scratch all over
But that wont stop you itching
Can you feel a little love
Can you feel a little love
Dream on dream on
Blame it on your karmic curse
Or shame upon the universe
It knows its lines its well rehearsed
It sucked you in it dragged you down
To where there is no hallow ground
Where holiness is never found
Paying debt to karma you party for a living
What you take wont kill you
But careful what youre giving
Can you feel a little love
Can you feel a little love
Dream on dream on
Can you feel a little love
Can you feel a little love
Dream on dream on
Dream on dream on
Dream on dream onWere the horniest boys
With the corniest ploys
Who take the easiest girls
To our sleaziest worlds
With our lecherous plans
In our treacherous hands
Youd be wasting your time
Saying no its a crime
All that we live for youll regret
All you remember well forget
We are the dead of night
Were in the zombie room
Were twilights parasites
With self-inflicted wounds
We are the dead of night
Were in the zombie room
Heavenly oversights
Eating from silver spoons
With our decadent minds
And our innocent lines
Youll be playing our games
With your bodies in flames
When delirious fun
Has seriously begun
Youll be down on your knees
Youll be begging us please
All were demanding youll supply
All were accused of well deny
We are the dead of night
Were in the zombie room
Were twilights parasites
With self-inflicted wounds
We are the dead of night
Were in the zombie room
Heavenly oversights
Eating from silver spoonsI heard a rumor
They travel far
You know what its like
The way people are
They talk and they talk
Though they dont understand
Theyll whisper and whisper
And lie on demand
Please tell me now
I want to know
I have to hear it from your lips
Say its not so
I heard it on Monday
And I laughed a while
I heard it on Tuesday
I managed to smile
I heard it on Wednesday
My patience was tried
I heard it on Thursday
And I hurt inside
I want to know
The depths of your mind
Tell me this whole thing is madness
And were doing fine
Put your little hand in mine
And believe in love
Put your head on my chest
And breathe love
Breathe love
Breathe love
Breathe love
I heard it from Peter
Who heard it from Paul
Who heard it from someone
I dont know at all
I heard it from Mary
Who heard it from Ruth
Who swore on the Bible
Shes telling the truth
I heard it from Simon
Who heard it from James
Confirming with Sarah
That I was to blame
I heard it from Joseph
Who heard it from John
Who said with conviction
That all hope was gone
So I need to know
Your alibis
I need to hear that you love me
Before you say goodbye
Before you say goodbye
Before you say goodbye
Before you say goodbyePut on your blindfold
And a dress thats tight
And come with me
On a mystery night
Open your eyes
Follow our stars under a painted sky
Well leave the world behind
Were learning to fly
We used to get by
Forget the pictures on your TV screen
Well steal the visions
That you keep for your dreams
You can turn me on
I was blind and I saw the light
My angel coming
In a brilliant white
Shine for me
Youve been hanging from a rope of mediocrity
Strung up by your insecurities
You can shine for me
Somebody has to
Shine for me
Its difficult not to
Shine for me
Follow our stars under a painted sky
Well leave the world behind
Were learning to fly
We used to get by
Forget the pictures on your TV screen
Well steal the visions
That you keep for your dreams
You can turn me on
Youve been hanging from a rope of mediocrity
Strung up by your insecurities
You can shine for me
Somebody has to
Shine for me
Its difficult not to
Shine for me
Somebody has to
Shine for me
Its difficult not to
Shine for meTaken in by the delicate noise
Knocked to the ground by the subtle thunder
Shackled and bound by the sound of your voice
Wandering around in silent wonder
What chance did I have
With the silver moon
Hanging in the sky
Opening old wounds
Taking hold of the hem of your dress
Cleanliness only comes in small doses
Bodily whole but my heads in a mess
Fueling obsession that borders psychosis
Its a sad disease
Creeping through my mind
Causing disabilities
Of the strangest kind
Getting lost in the folds of your skirt
Theres a price that I pay for my mission
A body in heaven and a mind full of dirt
How I suffer the sweetest condition
Taken in by the delicate noise
Knocked to the ground by the subtle thunder
Shackled and bound by the sound of your voice
Wandering around in silent wonderInstrumentalIf youve been hiding from love
If youve been hiding from love
I can understand where youre coming from
I can understand where youre coming from
If youve suffered enough
If youve suffered enough
I can understand what youre thinking of
I can see the pain that youre frightened of
And Im only here
To bring you free love
Lets make it clear
That this is free love
No hidden catch
No strings attached
Just free love
No hidden catch
No strings attached
Just free love
Ive been running like you
Ive been running like you
Now you understand why Im running scared
Now you understand why Im running scared
Ive been searching for truth
Ive been searching for truth
And I havent been getting anywhere
No I havent been getting anywhere
And Im only here
To bring you free love
Lets make it clear
That this is free love
No hidden catch
No strings attached
Just free love
No hidden catch
No strings attached
Just free love
Hey girl
Youve got to take this moment
Then let it slip away
Let go of complicated feelings
Then theres no price to pay
Weve been running from love
Weve been running from love
And we dont know what were doing here
No we dont know what were doing here
Were only here
Sharing our free love
Lets make it clear
That this is free love
No hidden catch
No strings attached
Just free love
No hidden catch
No strings attached
Just free loveGet that feeling
Head is reeling
You think youre in control
But you dont know me babe
I can move you
I can soothe you
I can take you places in a different way
I dont think you understand
What Im trying to say
Ill be your operator baby
Im in control
Watch your action
Close reaction
And everything youre thinking babe inside your head
Conversation my creation
Nothing that you do
You do unless I said
You dont know the consequences
Of the things you say
Ill be your operator baby
Im in controlWhen Im with you baby
I go out of my head
And I just cant get enough
And I just cant get enough
All the things you do to me
And everything you said
I just cant get enough
I just cant get enough
We slip and slide as we fall in love
And I just cant seem to get enough of
We walk together
Were walking down the street
And I just cant get enough
And I just cant get enough
Every time I think of you
I know we have to meet
And I just cant get enough
I just cant get enough
Its getting hotter
Its a burning love
And I just cant seem to get enough of
I just cant seem to get enough
I just cant seem to get enough
And when it rains
Youre shining down for me
And I just cant get enough
And I just cant get enough
Just like a rainbow
You know you set me free
And I just cant get enough
And I just cant get enough
Youre like an angel
And you give me your love
And I just cant seem to get enough of
I just cant get enoughShe remembered all the shadows and the doubts
The same film
Vivid pictures like a wall thats standing empty
And the night so still
Such a small affair a relapse someone closing
Like the nightclub door
Here again and when you speak I watch you move away
And seem so sure
She is hoping to forget and the moment
Almost slips away
When the colors move apart and I wonder
If you want to stay
And I need to change you like the words Im reading
Dont you understand
This the warning and the message I remember
As you touch my handThey were raining from the sky
Exploding in my heart
Is this a love in disguise
Or just a form of modern art
From the skies you could almost hear them cry
Tora Tora Tora
In the town they were going down
Tora Tora Tora
I had a nightmare only yesterday
You played a skeleton
You took my love then died that day
I played an American
From the skies you can almost hear them cry
Tora Tora Tora
In the town they were going down
Tora Tora ToraI saw you in the picture
I saw you play the part
This aint no disco
Theres a thousand watts in you
You take this too far
This aint no disco
Sometimes when I wonder if youre taking a chance
This aint no disco
And you know how to dance
Move me disco
Baby dont you let go
This aint no disco
Part one
Act one
Everyone pretend
This aint no disco
This is more a story
And were reaching the end
This aint no disco
Always makes me happy when youre taking a chance
This aint no disco
And you know how to dance
Move me disco
Baby dont you let go
This aint no discoI stand still stepping on the shady streets
And I watched that man to a stranger
You think you only know me when you turn on the light
Now the room is lit red danger
Complicating circulating
New life new life
Operating generating
New life new life
Transitions to another place
So the time will pass more slowly
Features fuse and your shadows red
Like a film Ive seen now show me
Your face is hidden and were out of sight
And the road just leads to nowhere
The stranger in the door is the same as before
So the question answers nowhereYou dont understand
This is a demand
And I think that I have to show you
Try to look inside
Take me for a ride
In the day and the night
Get to know you
Boys meet boys get together
Boys meet boys live forever
Dont say no
Boys say go
I can run away
If you never stay
And the rain and the pain and the sorrow
Im not very sure
When you close the door
If the end is the same as tomorrow
Boys
Boys
Boys say goA white house a white room
The program of today
Lights on switch on
Your eyes are far away
The map represents you
And the tape is your voice
Follow all along you
Till you recognize the choice
I take pictures
Photographic pictures
Bright light
Dark room
Bright light
Dark room
I said Id write a letter
But I never got the time
And Im looking to the day
I mesmerize the lightLight switch
Man switch
Film was broken only then
All the night
Fused tomorrow
Dancing with a distant friend
Filming and screening
I picture the scene
Filming and dreaming
Dreaming of me
So we left
Understanding
Clean cut so were sounding fast
Talked of sad
I talked of war
I laughed and climbed the rising cast
Quickly I remembered
Fused and saw a face before
Timing reason
Understanding
Like association hallInstrumentalSometimes watch you walk the street at midnight
Sometimes i can feel you in the air
Looking good knew you would
All the time i understood
Hey youre such a pretty boy
Hey youre such a pretty boy
Hey youre such a pretty boy
Youre so pretty
Everybody seems to look your way now
everybody seems to look your way
Everybody wants to know your name
hey hey whats your name
Feeling bright just tonight
Hear them say youre out of sight
Hey youre such a pretty boy
Hey youre such a pretty boy
Hey youre such a pretty boy
Youre so pretty
Hey youre such a pretty boy
Hey youre such a pretty boy
Hey youre such a pretty boy
Youre so pretty
All the boys we got to get together
All the boys together we can stand
We can go never know
All the things we need to show
Hey youre such a pretty boy
Hey youre such a pretty boy
Hey youre such a pretty boy
Youre so pretty
Hey youre such a pretty boy youre so pretty
Hey youre such a pretty boy youre so pretty
Hey youre such a pretty boy
Youre so pretty p-are-e double-t-y
Hey youre such a pretty boy
Hey youre such a pretty boy
Youre so prettySet me free
Remotivate me
Set me burning
After years in deep freeze
My body is yearning
For a new lease on life
Add a little spice
Set me free
Remotivate me
Give me a reason
To scream and shout
Give me something
To get excited about
When everything is looking dull
Im sure it isnt impossible to
Set me free
Remotivate me
Dont think Im impatient
Because Im willing to wait
But something must happen
Before it gets too late
It could be my imagination
But wasnt there more than this numb sensation
Set me free
Remotivate me
Set me freeThe sweetest perfection
To call my own
The slightest correction
Couldnt finely hone
The sweetest infection
Of body and mind
Sweetest injection
Of any kind
I stop and I stare too much
Afraid that I care too much
And I hardly dare to touch
For fear that the spell may be broken
When I need a drug in me
And it brings out the thug in me
Feel something tugging me
Then I want the real thing not tokens
The sweetest perfection
Things youd expect to be
Having effect on me
Pass undetectedly
But everyone knows what has got me
Takes me completely
Touches so sweetly
Reaches so deeply
I know that nothing can stop me
Sweetest perfection
An offer was made
An assorted collection
But I wouldnt trade
The sweetest perfection
Takes me completely
Touches so sweetly
Reaches so deeply
Nothing can stop meI feel you your sun it shines
I feel you within my mind
You take me there you take me where the kingdom comes
You take me to and lead me through Babylon
This is the morning of our love
Its just the dawning of our love
I feel you your heart it sings
I feel you the joy it brings
Where heaven waits those golden gates and back again
You take me to you lead me through oblivion
This is the morning of our love
Its just the dawning of our love
I feel you your precious soul and I am whole
I feel you your rising sun my kingdom comes
I feel you each move you make
I feel you each breath you take
Where angels sing and spread their wings my loves on high
You take me home to glorys throne by and by
This is the morning of our love
Its just the dawning of our love
This is the morning of our love
Its just the dawning of our loveYou know what I need
When my heart bleeds
I suffer from greed
A longing to feed
On the mercy in you
I cant conceal
The way Im healed
The pleasure I feel
When I have to deal
With the mercy in you
I would do it all again
Lose my way and fall again
Just so I could call again
On the mercy in you
When here in my mind
I feel inclined
To wrongly treat you unkind
I have faith I will find
The mercy in you
I would lose my way again
Be led hopelessly astray again
Just so I could pray again
For the mercy in you
When here in my mind
I have been blind
Emotionally behind
I have faith I will find
The mercy in youPut it on
And dont say a word
Put it on
The one that I prefer
Put it on
And stand before my eyes
Put it on
Please dont question why
Can you believe
Something so simple
Something so trivial
Makes me a happy man
Cant you understand
Say you believe
Just how easy
It is to please me
Because when you learn
Youll know what makes the world turn
Put it on
I can feel so much
Put it on
I dont need to touch
Put it on
Here before my eyes
Put it on
Because you realise
And you believe
Something so worthless
Serves a purpose
It makes me a happy man
Cant you understand
Say you believe
Just how easy
It is to please me
Because when you learn
Youll know what makes the world turnIm taking a ride
With my best friend
I hope he never lets me down again
He knows where hes taking me
Taking me where I want to be
Im taking a ride
With my best friend
Were flying high
Were watching the world pass us by
Never want to come down
Never want to put my feet back down
On the ground
Im taking a ride
With my best friend
I hope he never lets me down again
Promises me Im as safe as houses
As long as I remember whos wearing the trousers
I hope he never lets me down again
Never let me down
See the stars theyre shining bright
Everythings alright tonightCondemnation
Tried
Here on the stand
With the book in my hand
And truth on my side
Accusations
Lies
Hand me my sentence
Ill show no repentance
Ill suffer with pride
If for honesty
You want apologies
I dont sympathize
If for kindness
You substitute blindness
Please open your eyes
Condemnation
Why
Because my duty
Was always to beauty
And that was my crime
Feel elation
High
To know I can trust this
Fix of injustice
Time after time
If you see purity
As immaturity
Well its no surprise
If for kindness
You substitute blindness
Please open your eyesIs simplicity best
Or simply the easiest
The narrowest path
Is always the holiest
So walk on barefoot for me
Suffer some misery
If you want my love
If you want my love
Man will survive
The harshest conditions
And stay alive
Through difficult decisions
So make up your mind for me
Walk the line for me
If you want my love
If you want my love
Idle talk
And hollow promises
Cheating Judases
Doubting Thomases
Dont just stand there and shout it
Do something about it
You can fulfill
Your wildest ambitions
And Im sure you will
Lose your inhibitions
So open yourself for me
Risk your health for me
If you want my love
If you want my love
If you want my love
If you want my loveClose
Naked
Skin on skin
Tears are falling
Tears of joy
Her first boy
His first girl
Makes a change
In a world full of nothing
Though its not love
It means something
Shes lonely
And he says
Its for her only
That he lusts
She doesnt trust him
Nothing is true
But he will do
In a world full of nothing
Though its not love
It means something
Its not easy to slip away
And believe it all
Though its not love
It means somethingWorking weeks come to its end
Party time is here again
Everyone can come if they want to
If you want to be with me
If you want to be with me
You can come with me if you want to
Exercise your basic right
We could build a building site
From the bricks of shame is built the hope
If you want to be with me
If you want to be with me
Even though you may still not want to
Let tomorrow and today
Bring a life of ecstasy
Wipe away your tears of confusion
If you want to be with me
If you want to be with me
You can come with me if you want to
Even though you still may not want toDeath is everywhere
There are flies on the windscreen
For a start
Reminding us
We could be torn apart
Tonight
Death is everywhere
There are lambs for the slaughter
Waiting to die
And I can sense
The hours slipping by
Tonight
Come here
Kiss me
Now
Come here
Kiss me
Now
Death is everywhere
The more I look
The more I see
The more I feel
A sense of urgency
Tonight
Come here touch me
Kiss me touch me
Now touch me
touch me
Come here touch me
Kiss me touch me
Now touch me
touch me
There are flies on the windscreen
There are lambs for the slaughter
There are flies on the windscreen
Come here touch me
Kiss me touch me
Now touch me
touch me
Come here touch me
Kiss me touch me
Now touch me
touch meI am happy
That I have you
Even though youre not here now
I know somewhere
You are dreaming
Though its definitely not of me
It doesnt matter
If this all shatters
Nothing lasts forever
But Im praying
That were staying
Together
I am warmed by
Your friendship
Even when youre far away
And Im happy
In the knowledge
We may never see the day
When I kiss you
And you kiss me
Dont pretend you miss me
The worst kind
Of diseased mind
Is one filled with jealousy
If we should meet again
Dont try to solve the puzzle
Just lay down next to me
And please dont move a muscle
I will thank you
Most of all for
The respect you have for me
Im embarrassed
It overwhelms me
Because I dont deserve any
It doesnt matter
If this all shatters
Nothing lasts forever
But Im praying
That were staying
TogetherFragile
Like a baby in your arms
Be gentle with me
Id never willingly
Do you harm
Apologies
Are all you seem to get from me
But just like a child
You make me smile
When you care for me
And you know
Its a question of lust
Its a question of trust
Its a question of not letting
What weve built up
Crumble to dust
It is all of these things and more
That keep us together
Independence
Is still important for us though we realise
Its easy to make
The stupid mistake
Of letting go do you know what I mean
My weaknesses
You know each and every one it frightens me
But I need to drink
More than you seem to think
Before Im anyones
And you know
Its a question of lust
Its a question of trust
Its a question of not letting
What weve built up
Crumble to dust
It is all of these things and more
That keep us together
Kiss me goodbye
When Im on my own
But you know that Id
Rather be home
Its a question of lustWell Im down on my knees again
And I pray to the only one
Who has the strength
To bear the pain
To forgive all the things that Ive done
Oh girl
Lead me into your darkness
When this world is trying its hardest
To leave me unimpressed
Just one caress
From you and Im blessed
When you think youve tried every road
Every avenue
Take one more look
At what you found old
And in it youll find something new
Oh girl
Lead me into your darkness
When this world is trying its hardest
To leave me unimpressed
Just one caress
From you and Im blessed
Im shying from the light
I always loved the night
And now you offer me eternal darkness
I have to believe that sin
Can make a better man
Its the mood that I am in
That left us back where we began
Oh girl
Lead me into your darkness
When this world is trying its hardest
To leave me unimpressed
Just one caress
From you and Im blessed
Oh girl
Lead me into your darkness
When this world is trying its hardest
To leave me unimpressed
Just one caress
From you and Im blessedYou wear guilt
Like shackles on your feet
Like a halo in reverse
I can feel
The discomfort in your seat
And in your head its worse
Theres a pain
A famine in your heart
An aching to be free
Cant you see
All loves luxuries
Are here for you and me
And when our worlds they fall apart
When the walls come tumbling in
Though we may deserve it
It will be worth it
Bring your chains
Your lips of tragedy
And fall into my armsI can taste more than feel
This burning inside is so real
I can almost lay my hands upon
The warm glow that lingers on
Moved lifted higher
Moved my souls on fire
Moved by a higher love
I surrender all control
To the desire that consumes me whole
Leads me by the hand to infinity
Lies in wait at the heart of me
Moved lifted higher
Moved my souls on fire
Moved by a higher love
Heaven bound on the wings of love
Theres so much that you can rise above
Moved lifted higher
Moved moved by a higher love
By a higher love
I surrender heart and soul
Sacrificed to a higher goal
Moved moved by a higher love
By a higher loveChorus 
Come on and lay with me
Come on and lie to me
Tell me you love me
Say Im the only one
Experiences have a lasting impression
But words once spoken
Dont mean a lot now
Belief is the way
The way of the innocent
And when I say innocent
I should say naive
So lie to me
But do it with sincerity
Make me listen
Just for a minute
Make me think
Theres some truth in it
Promises made for convenience
Arent necessarily
What we need
Truth is a word
Thats lost its meaning
The truth has become
Merely half-truth
So lie to me
Like they do it in the factory
Make me think
That at the end of the day
Some great reward
Will be coming my wayInstrumentalPeople are people so why should it be
You and I should get along so awfully
So were different colours
And were different creeds
And different people have different needs
Its obvious you hate me
Though Ive done nothing wrong
I never even met you
So what could I have done
I cant understand
What makes a man
Hate another man
Help me understand
People are people so why should it be
You and I should get along so awfully
Help me understand
Now youre punching and youre kicking
And youre shouting at me
Im relying on your common decency
So far it hasnt surfaced
But Im sure it exists
It just takes a while to travel
From your head to your fist
I cant understand
What makes a man
Hate another man
Help me understandIm not going down on my knees
Begging you to adore me
Cant you see its misery
And torture for me
When Im misunderstood
Try as hard as you can Ive tried as hard as I could
To make you see
How important it is for me
Here is a plea
From my heart to you
Nobody knows me
As well as you do
You know how hard it is for me
To shake the disease
That takes hold of my tongue
In situations like these
Understand me
Some people have to be
Permanently together
Lovers devoted to
Each other forever
Now Ive got things to do
And Ive said before that I know you have too
When Im not there
In spirit Ill be there
Here is a plea
From my heart to you
Nobody knows me
As well as you do
You know how hard it is for me
To shake the disease
That takes hold of my tongue
In situations like these
Understand meI need to be cleansed
Its time to make amends
For all of the fun
The damage is done
And I feel diseased
Im down on my knees
And I need forgiveness
Someone to bear witness
To the goodness within
Beneath the sin
Although I may flirt
With all kinds of dirt
To the point of disease
Now I want release
From all this decay
Take it away
And somewhere
Theres someone who cares
With a heart of gold
To have and to holdTake a look at unselected cases
Youll find love has been wrecked
By both sides compromising
Amounting to a disastrous effect
You hear stories of old
Of princes bold
With riches untold
Happy souls
Casting it all aside
To take some bride
To have the girl of their dreams
At their side
But not me
I couldnt do that
Not me
Im not like that
I couldnt sacrifice
Anything at all
To love
I really like you
Im attracted to you
The way you move
The things you do
Ill probably burn in hell
For saying this
But Im really in heaven
Whenever we kiss
But Oh no
You wont change me
You can try
For an eternity
I wouldnt sacrifice
Anything at all
To love
Now Ive got things to do
You have too
And Ive got to be me
Youve got to be you
So take my hand
And feel these lips
And lets savour a kiss
Like wed savour a sip
Of vintage wine
One more time
Lets surrender
To this love divine
But we wont sacrifice
Anything at all
To loveYou wear guilt
Like shackles on your feet
Like a halo in reverse
I can feel
The discomfort in your seat
And in your head its worse
Theres a pain
A famine in your heart
An aching to be free
Cant you see
All loves luxuries
Are here for you and me
And when our worlds they fall apart
When the walls come tumbling in
Though we may deserve it
It will be worth it
Bring your chains
Your lips of tragedy
And fall into my armsHere is the house
Where it all happens
Those tender moments
Under this roof
Body and soul come together
As we come closer together
And is it happens
It happens here in this house
And I feel your warmth
And it feels like home
And theres someone
Calling on the telephone
Lets stay home
Its cold outside
And I have so much
To confide to you
With or without words
Ill confide everything
Here is the house
Where it all happens
Those tender moments
Under this roof
Body and soul come together
As we come closer together
And as it happens
It happens here in this house
So we stay at home
And Im by your side
And you know
Whats going on inside
Inside my heart
Inside this house
And I just want to
Let it out for you
And I feel your warmth
And it feels like home
And I feel your warmth
And it feels like home
Here is the house
Where it all happens
Those tender moments
Under this roof
Body and soul come together
As we come closer togetherSacred

To put it in words
To write it down

But its my duty

So here is my confession
Its an obsession

Trying to sell the story
Of loves eternal glory

To put it in words
To write it down
That is walking on hallowed ground
But its my duty

Spreading the news around the world
Taking the word to boys and girls

And a warm receiver
And I will go down on my knees
When I see beauty
Theres no doubt
Im one of the devout
Trying to sell the story
Of loves eternal glory

Grey sky over a black town
I can feel depression
All around
Youve got your leather boots on
I cant stand another drink
Its surprising this town
Doesnt sink
Youve got your leather boots on
Your pretty dress is oil stained
From working too hard
For too little
Youve got your leather boots on
Youre feeling the boredom too
Id gladly go with you
Id put your leather boots on
Id put your pretty dress onLets have a black celebration
Black Celebration
Tonight
To celebrate the fact
That weve seen the back
Of another black day
I look to you
How you carry on
When all hope is gone
Cant you see
Your optimistic eyes
Seem like paradise
To someone like
Me
I want to take you
In my arms
Forgetting all I couldnt do today
Black Celebration
Black Celebration
Tonight
To celebrate the fact
That weve seen the back
Of another black day
I look to you
And your strong belief
Me I want relief
Tonight
Consolation
I want so much
Want to feel your touch
Tonight
Take me in your arms
Forgetting all you couldnt do today
Black Celebration
Ill drink to that
Black Celebration
TonightAs I lay here with you
The shame lies with us
We talk of love and trust
That doesnt matter
Though we may be the last in the world
We feel like pioneers
Telling hopes and fears
To one another
And oh what a feeling
Inside of me
It might last for an hour
Wounds arent healing
Inside of me
Though it feel good now
I know its only for now
The feeling is intense
You grip me with your eyes
And then I realize
It doesnt matterClean
The cleanest Ive been
An end to the tears
And the in-between years
And the troubles Ive seen
Now that Im clean
You know what I mean
Ive broken my fall
Put an end to it all
Ive changed my routine
Now Im clean
I dont understand
What destinys planned
Im starting to grasp
What is in my own hands
I dont claim to know
Where my holiness goes
I just know that I like
What is starting to show
Sometimes
Clean
The cleanest Ive been
An end to the tears
And the in-between years
And the troubles Ive seen
Now that Im clean
You know what I mean
Ive broken my fall
Put an end to it all
Ive changed my routine
Now Im clean
As years go by
All the feelings inside
Twist and they turn
As they ride with the tide
I dont advise
And I dont criticise
I just know what I like
With my own eyes
Sometimes
Clean
The cleanest Ive been
An end to the tears
And the in-between years
And the troubles Ive seen
Now that Im clean
You know what I mean
Ive broken my fall
Put an end to it all
Ive changed my routine
Now Im clean
SometimesI want somebody to share
Share the rest of my life
Share my innermost thoughts
Know my intimate details
Someone wholl stand by my side
And give me support
And in return
Shell get my support
She will listen to me
When I want to speak
About the world we live in
And life in general
Though my views may be wrong
They may even be perverted
Shell hear me out
And wont easily be converted
To my way of thinking
In fact shell often disagree
But at the end of it all
She will understand me
I want somebody who cares
For me passionately
With every thought and
With every breath
Someone wholl help me see things
In a different light
All the things I detest
I will almost like
I dont want to be tied
To anyones strings
Im carefully trying to steer clear of
Those things
But when Im asleep
I want somebody
Who will put their arms around me
And kiss me tenderly
Though things like this
Make me sick
In a case like this
Ill get away with itI will have faith in man
That is hard to understand
Show some humility
You have the ability
Get right with me
Friends if youve lost your way
You will find it again some day
Come down from your pedestals
And open your mouths thats all
Get right with me
Life is such a short thing
That I cannot comprehend
But if this life were a bought thing
There are ways I know wed mend
People take my advice
Already told you once once or twice
Dont waste your energy
Making apologies
Get right with meOh God its raining
But Im not complaining
Its filling me up
With new life
The stars in the sky
Bring tears to my eyes
Theyre lighting my way
Tonight
And I havent felt so alive
In years
Just for a day
On a day like today
Ill get away from this
Constant debauchery
The wind in my hair
Makes me so aware
How good it is to live
Tonight
And I havent felt so alive
In years
The moon
Is shining in the sky
Reminding me
Of so many other nights
But theyre not like tonight
Oh God its raining
And Im not containing
My pleasure at being
So wet
Here on my own
All on my own
How good it feels to be alone
Tonight
And I havent felt so alive
In years
The moon
Is shining in the sky
Reminding me
Of so many other nights
When my eyes have been so red
Ive been mistaken for dead
But not tonightSometimes
Only sometimes
I question everything
And Im the first to admit
If you catch me in a mood like this
I can be tiring
Even embarrassing
But you must
Feel the same
When you look around
You cant tell me honestly
Youre happy with what you see
Oh sometimes
Only sometimes
You must be
You must be
As embarrassing as me
SometimesSex jibe husband murders wife
Bomb blast victim fights for life
Girl Thirteen attacked with knife
Princess Di is wearing a new dress
Jet airliner shot from sky
Famine horror millions die
Earthquake terror figures rise
Princes Di is wearing a new dress
You cant change the world
But you can change the facts
And when you change the facts
You change points of view
If you change points of view
You may change a vote
And when you change a vote
You may change the world
In black townships fires blaze
Prospects better premier says
Within sight are golden days
Princess Di is wearing a New Dress
You cant change the world
But you can change the facts
And when you change the facts
You change points of view
If you change points of view
You may change a vote
And when you change a vote
You may change the world
Princess Di is wearing a New DressGirl of sixteen whole life ahead of her
Slashed her wrists bored with life
Didnt succeed thank the Lord
For small mercies
Fighting back the tears mother reads the note again
Sixteen candles burn in her mind
She takes the blame its always the same
She goes down on her knees and prays
I dont want to start any blasphemous rumours
But I think that Gods got a sick sense of humor
And when I die I expect to find Him laughing
Girl of eighteen fell in love with everything
Found new life in Jesus Christ
Hit by a car ended up
On a life support machine
Summers day as she passed away
Birds were singing in the summer sky
Then came the rain and once again
A tear fell from her mothers eye
I dont want to start any blasphemous rumours
But I think that Gods got a sick sense of humor
And when I die I expect to find Him laughingLittle fifteen
You help her forget
The world outside
Youre not part of it yet
And if you could drive
You could drive her away
To a happier place
To a happier day
That exists in your mind
And in your smile
She could escape there
Just for a while
Little fifteen
Little fifteen
Why take the smooth with the rough
When things run smooth
Its already more than enough
She knows your mind
Is not yet in league
With the rest of the world
And its little intrigues
Do you understand
Do you know what she means
As time goes by
And when youve seen what shes seen
you will
Little fifteen
Little fifteen
Why does she have to defend
Her feelings inside
Why pretend
Shes not had a life
A life of near misses
Now all that she wants
Is three little wishes
She wants to see with your eyes
She wants to smile with your smile
She wants a nice surprise
Every once in a while
She wants to see with your eyes
She wants to smile with your smile
She wants a nice surprise
Every once in a while
Little fifteenI heard it from my friends
About the things you said
I heard it from my friends
About the things you said
But they know me better than that
They know me better than that
They know my weaknesses
I never tried to hide them
They know my weaknesses
I never denied them
I heard it from my friends
About the things you said
I heard it from my friends
About the things you said
How can a view become so twisted
How can a view become so twisted
They know my weaknesses
I never tried to hide them
They know my weaknesses
You tried them
I get so carried away
You brought me down to earth
I thought we had something precious
Now I know what its worth
I heard it from my friends
About the things you said
I heard it from my friends
About the things you said
Ive never felt so disappointed
Never felt so disappointed
They know my weaknesses
I never tried to hide them
They know my weaknesses
Thought that you liked them
They know me better than thatI want you now
Tomorrow wont do
Theres a yearning inside
And its showing through
Reach out your hands
And accept my love
Weve waited for too long
Enough is enough
I want you now
My heart is aching
My body is burning
My hands are shaking
My head is turning
You understand
Its so easy to choose
Weve got time to kill
Weve got nothing to lose
I want you now
And I dont mean to sound
Like one of the boys
Thats now what Im trying to do
I dont want to be
Like one of the boys
I just want you now
Because Ive got a love
A love that wont wait
A love that is growing
And its getting late
Do you know what it means
To be left this way
When everyones gone
And the feelings they stay
I want you now
