Im so tired of being here
Suppressed by all my childish fears
And if you have to leave
I wish that you would just leave
Cause your presence still lingers here
And it wont leave me alone
These wounds wont seem to heal this pain is just too real
Theres just too much that time cannot erase
When you cried Id wipe away all of your tears
When youd scream Id fight away all of your fears
And I held your hand through all of these years
But you still have all of me
You used to captivate me by your resonating light
Now Im bound by the life you left behind
Your face it haunts my once pleasant dreams
Your voice it chased away all the sanity in me
These wounds wont seem to heal this pain is just too real
Theres just too much that time cannot erase
When you cried Id wipe away all of your tears
When youd scream Id fight away all of your fears
And I held your hand through all of these years
But you still have all of me
Ive tried so hard to tell myself that youre gone
But though youre still with me Ive been alone all along
When you cried Id wipe away all of your tears
When youd scream Id fight away all of your fears
And I held your hand through all of these years
You still have all of me me meCigarette Lit
My Plans to Quit
And I know I can but I know I will forget it
Stuck here I need something quick
Jus to stop me thinking
Always loud always in
Jus come in to me
Excuse me please what have you got
Get me out of my head while Ive still got the courage
But not so out just out enough till I feel like Im takin off
The rain falls down Im not alone
Covers all of us in silver line silver line
And all I beg you stay with me
Let it rain all night
What a gift this short visit
And I know Ill go just as quick as I came in
Night stick my finger tips
Jus stop me thinking
Always out always in
Oh jus come in to me
Excuse me please what have you got
Get me out of my head while Ive still got the courage
Not so out just out enough till I feel like Im takin off
And the rain fall down Im so alone
And covered all of us with silver line in silver line
And all I beg you stay with me
Let it rain all night
Im always out always in
Jus come in to me
Not so out just out enough till I feel like Im takin off
And the rain falls down Im not alone
And covers all of us in silver line in silver line
And all I beg you stay with me
Let it rain all night oh oh
And the rain falls down Im not alone
It covers up in a silver line in silver line
And all I beg you stay with me
Let it rain all nightI sense theres something in the wind
That feels like tragedys at hand
And though Id like to stand by him
Cant shake this feeling that I have
The worst is just around the bend
And does he notice my feelings for him
And will he see how much he means to me
I think its not to be
What will become of my dear friend
Where will his actions lead us then
Although Id like to join the crowd
In their enthusiastic cloud
Try as I may it doesnt last
And will we ever end up together
No I think not its never to become
For I am not the one
And will we ever end up together
OhhhhhhhCatch me as I fall
Say youre here and its all over now
Speaking to the atmosphere
No ones here and I fall into myself
This truth drives me
Into madness
I know I can stop the pain
If I will it all away
Dont turn away
Dont give in to the pain
Dont try to hide
Though theyre screaming your name
Dont close your eyes
God knows what lies behind them
Dont turn out the light
Never sleep never die
Im frightened by what I see
But somehow I know
That theres much more to come
Immobilized by my fear
And soon to be
Blinded by tears
I can stop the pain
If I will it all away
Dont turn away
Dont give in to the pain
Dont try to hide
Though theyre screaming your name
Dont close your eyes
God knows what lies behind them
Dont turn out the light
Never sleep never die
Fallen angels at my feet
Whispered voices at my ear
Death before my eyes
Lying next to me I fear
She beckons me
Shall I give in
Upon my end shall I begin
Forsaking all Ive fallen for
I rise to meet my end
Dont turn away
Dont give in to the pain
Dont try to hide
Though theyre screaming your name
Dont close your eyes
God knows what lies behind them
Dont turn out the light
Never sleep never die
Dont turn away
Dont give in to the pain
Dont try to hide
Though theyre screaming your name
Dont close your eyes
God knows what lies behind them
Dont turn out the light
Never sleep never die
Dont turn away
Dont give in to the pain
Dont try to hide
Though theyre screaming your name
Dont close your eyes
God knows what lies behind them
Dont turn out the light
Never sleep never dieLong lost words whisper slowly to me
Still cant find what keeps me here
When all this time Ive been so hollow inside
I know youre still there
Watching me wanting me
I can feel you pull me down
Fearing you loving you
I wont let you pull me down
Hunting you I can smell you - alive
Your heart pounding in my head
Watching me wanting me
I can feel you pull me down
Saving me raping me
Watching meIm so tired of being here
Suppressed by all my childish fears
And if you have to leave
I wish that you would just leave
Cause your presence still lingers here
And it wont leave me alone

Perfect by nature
I come from self indulgence
Just what we all need
More lies about a world that
Never was and never will be
Have you no shame Dont you see me
You know youve got everybody fooled
Look here she comes now
Bow down and stare in wonder
Oh how we love you
No flaws when youre pretending
But now I know she
Never was and never will be
You dont know how youve betrayed me
And somehow youve got everybody fooled
Without the mask where will you hide
Cant find yourself lost in your lie
I know the truth now
I know who you are
And I dont love you anymore
It Never was and never will be
You dont know how youve betrayed me
And somehow youve got everybody fooled
It never was and never will be
Youre not real and you cant save me
Somehow now youre everybodys foolYou dont remember me but I remember you
I lie awake and try so hard not to think of you
But who can decide what they dream
And dream I do
I believe in you
Ill give up everything just to find you
I have to be with you to live to breathe
Youre taking over me
Have you forgotten all I know
And all we had
You saw me mourning my love for you
And touched my hand
I knew you loved me then
I believe in you
Ill give up everything just to find you
I have to be with you to live to breathe
Youre taking over me
I look in the mirror and see your face
If I look deep enough
So many things inside that are just like you are taking over
I believe in you
Ill give up everything just to find you
I have to be with you to live to breathe
Youre taking over me
I believe in you
Ill give up everything just to find you
I have to be with you to live to breathe
Youre taking over me
Youre taking over meIve been looking in the mirror for so long
That Ive come to believe my souls on the other side
All the little pieces falling shatter
Shards of me
Too sharp to put back together
Too small to matter
But big enough to cut me into so many little pieces
If I try to touch her
And I bleed
I bleed
And I breathe
I breathe no more
Take a breath and I try to draw from my spirits well
Yet again you refuse to drink like a stubborn child
Lie to me
Convince me that Ive been sick forever
And all of this
Will make sense when I get better
but I know the difference
Between myself and my reflection
I just cant help but to wonder
Which of us do you love
So I bleed
I bleed
And I breathe
I breathe no
Bleed
I bleed
And I breathe
I breathe
I breathe
I breathe no moreI linger in the doorway
Of alarm clock screaming monsters calling my name
Let me stay
Where the wind will whisper to me
Where the raindrops as theyre falling tell a story
In my field of paper flowers
And candy clouds of lullaby
I lie inside myself for hours
And watch my purple sky fly over me
Dont say Im out of touch
With this rampant chaos your reality
I know well what lies beyond my sleeping refuge
The nightmare I built my own world to escape
In my field of paper flowers
And candy clouds of lullaby
I lie inside myself for hours
And watch my purple sky fly over meHow can you see into my eyes like open doors
Leading you down into my core
Where Ive become so numb without a soul
My spirits sleeping somewhere cold
Until you find it there and lead it back home
Wake me up wake me up inside I cant wake up
Wake me up inside save me
Call my name and save me from the dark wake me up
Bid my blood to run I cant wake up
Before I come undone save me
Save me from the nothing Ive become
Now that I know what Im without
You cant just leave me
Breathe into me and make me real bring me to life
Wake me up wake me up inside I cant wake up
Wake me up inside save me
Call my name and save me from the dark wake me up
Bid my blood to run I cant wake up
Before I come undone save me
Save me from the nothing Ive become
Bring me to life Ive been living a lie
Theres nothing inside bring me to life
Frozen inside without your touch
Without your love darling
Only you are the life among the dead
All this time I cant believe I couldnt see
Kept in the dark but you were there in front of me
Ive been sleeping a thousand years it seems
Ive got to open my eyes to everything
Without a thought without a voice without a soul
Dont let me die here
There must be something wrong bring me to life
Wake me up wake me up inside I cant wake up
Wake me up inside save me
Call my name and save me from the dark wake me up
Bid my blood to run I cant wake up
Before I come undone save me
Save me from the nothing Ive become
Bring me to life Ive been living a lie theres nothing inside
Bring me to lifePlease please forgive me
But I wont be home again
Maybe someday youll have woke up
And barely conscious youll say to no one
Isnt something missing
You wont cry for my absence I know
You forgot me long ago
Am I that unimportant
Am I so insignificant
Isnt something missing
Isnt someone missing me
Even though Im the sacrifice
You wont try for me not now
Though Id die to know you love me
Im all alone
Isnt someone missing me
Please please forgive me
But I wont be home again
I know what you do to yourself
I breathe deep and cry out
Isnt something missing
Isnt someone missing me
Even though Im the sacrifice
You wont try for me not now
Though Id die to know you love me
Im all alone
Isnt someone missing me
And if I bleed Ill bleed
Knowing you dont care
And if I sleep just to dream of you
And wake without you there
Isnt something missing
Isnt something
Even though Im the sacrifice
You wont try for me not now
Though Id die to know you love me
Im all alone
Isnt someone missing meAll of my hate cannot be bound

Holding my last breath
Safe inside myself

Sweet raptured light
It ends here tonight
Ill miss the winter
A world of fragile things
Look for me in the white forest
Hiding in a hollow tree come find me
I know you hear me
I can taste it in your tears
Holding my last breath
Safe inside myself
Are all my thoughts of you
Sweet raptured light
It ends here tonight
Closing your eyes to disappear
You pray your dreams will leave you here
But still you wake and know the truth -
No ones there

Holding my last breathNobody on the road
Nobody on the beach
I feel it in the air
The summers out of reach
Empty lake empty streets
The sun goes down alone
Im drivin by your house
Though I know youre not at home
But I can see you
Your brown skin shinin in the sun
You got your hair combed back and your sunglasses on baby
And I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone
I never will forget those nights
I wonder if it was a dream
Remember how you made me crazy
Remember how I made you scream
Now I dont understand what happened to our love
But babe Im gonna get you back
Im gonna show you what Im made of
I can see you
Your brown skin shinin in the sun
I see you walkin real slow and youre smilin at everyone
I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone
Out on the road today I saw a BLACK FLAG sticker on a Cadillac
A little voice Inside my head said Dont look back You cannever look back
I thought I knew what love was
What did I know
Those days are gone forever
I should just let them go but
I can see you
Your brown skin shinin in the sun
You got that top pulled down and that radio on baby
And I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone
I can see you
Your brown skin shinin in the sun
You got that hair slicked back and those Wayfarers on baby
I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have goneHow can i pretend that i dont see
what you hide so carelessly
i saw her bleed
you heard me breathe
and i froze inside myself
and turned away
i must be dreaming
We all live
We all die
That does not begin to justify you
Its not what it seems
Not what you think
No I must be dreaming
Its only in my mind
Not real life
No I must be dreaming
Help you know ive got to tell someone
Tell them what i know youve done
I fear you but spoken fears can come true
We all live

That does not begin to justify you
Its not what it seems
Not what you think
No I must be dreaming
Its only in my mind
Not real life
No I must be dreaming

Oh sim sim
Eu s estou tentando compreender
O que h de errado com sua cabea
Toda vez que eu olho em volta
Voc est em outro lugar
Eu quero te perguntar por que
Mas toda vez que eu tento voc chora
CHORUS
E eu quero que voc saiba
Quando voc est viajando no espao
E eu quero que voc saiba
Se voc ir voltar aqui pra baixo
E eu preciso que voc saiba
Eu quero te respirar eu quero te sentir perto
Esta minha confisso
Eu quero ver o que voc v quando voc chora essas lgrimas

O que sou eu para fazer
Talvez seja minha obsesso mas
Essa minha confisso
Eu confesso
Toda vez que eu estou por perto
Algo sempre a deprime
E eu no entendo por que
Mas se voc quiser me dizer
Eu serei o anjo da guarda baby
Eu serei o homem que voc confia
Mas eu no posso parecer correr
Eu te pego fora desse lugar
Porque tudo o que voc faz s
Apagar minha dor
O dio est dentro
Eu eu no posso perguntar por que
CHORUS at acabarOriginally by The Offspring
I wrote her off for the tenth time today
And practiced all the things I would say
But she came over
I lost my nerve
I took her back and made her desverve
Now I know Im being used
Thats okay man cause I like the abuse
I know shes playing with me
Thats okay cause Ive got no self esteem
oh yeah yeah yeah
We make plans to go out at night
I wait till two then I turn out the light
All this rejections got me so low
If she keeps it up I just might tell her so
When shes saying all that she wants only me
Then I wonder why she sleeps with my friends
When shes saying all that Im like a disease
Then I wonder how much more I can spend
Well I guess I should stick up for myself
But I really think its better this way
The more you suffer
The more it shows you really care Right Yeah
Now Ill relate this little bit
That happens more than Id like to admit
Late at night she knocks on my door
Shes Drunk again and looking to score
Now I know I should say no
But thats kind of hard when shes ready to go
I may be dumb but Im not a dweeb
Im just a sucker with no self esteem
oh yeah yeah yeah
When shes saying all that she wants only me
Then I wonder why she sleeps with my friends
When shes saying all that Im like a disease
Then I wonder how much more I can spend
Well I guess I should stick up for myself
But I really think its better this way
The more you suffer
The more it shows you really care Right YeahI will wander til the end of time torn away from you
I pull away to face the pain
I close my eyes and drift away
Over the fear that I will never find
A way to heal my soul
And I will wander til the end of time
Torn away from you
My heart is broken
Sweet sleep my dark angel
Deliver us from sorrows hold
Or from my hard heart
I cant go on living this way
And I cant go back the way I came
Shamed of this fear that I will never find
A way to heal my soul
And I will wander til the end of time
Half a life without you
My heart is broken
Sweet sleep my dark angel
Deliver us change open your eyes to the light
I denied it all so long oh so long
Say goodbye goodbye
My heart is broken
Release me I cant hold on
Deliver us my heart is broken
Sweet sleep my dark angel
Deliver us my heart is broken
Sweet sleep my dark angel
Deliver us from sorrows holdby Meat Loaf
And i would do anything for love id run right into hell and back
I would do anything for love ill never lie to you and thats a fact
But ill never forget the way you feel right now
- oh no - no way - i would do anything for love
I would do anything for love threex
But i wont do that no i wont do that
Some days it dont come easy some days it dont come hard
Some days it dont come at all and these are the days that never end
Some nights you breath fire some nights your carved in ice
Some nights youre like nothing ive ever seen before or will again
Maybe im crazy but its crazy and its true
I know you can save me no one else can save me now but you
As long as the planets are turning as long as the stars are burning
As long as your dreams are coming true - you better believe it
That i would do anything for love threex
But i wont do that i wont do that
I would do anything for love
Anything youve been dreaming of
But i just wont do that
Some days i pray for silence some days i pray for soul
Some days i just pray to the god of sex and drums and rock n roll
Maybe im lonely and thats all im qualified to be
Theres just one and only the one and only promise i can keep
As long as the wheels are turning as long as the fires are burning
As long as your prayers are coming true - you better believe it
That i would do anything for love
And you know its true and thats a fact i would do anything for love
And therell never be no turning back
But ill never do it better than i do it with you
So long so long - i would do anything for love threex
But i wont do that i wont do that
Girl will you raise me up will you help me down
Will you help get me right out of this godforsaken town
Will you make it a little less cold
Boy i can do that i can do that
Girl will you cater to every fantasy that ive got
Will ya hose me down with holy water - if i get too hot
Will you take me to places that ive never known
Boy i can do that i can do that
Girl i know the territory ive been around
Itll all turn to dust and well all fall down
And sooner or later youll be screwing around
Boy i wont do that i wont do that
Anything for love but i wont do thatOriginally by Garbage
Im only happy when it rains
Im only happy when its complicated
And though I know you cant appreciate it
Im only happy when it rains
You know I love it when the news is bad
And why it feels so good to feel so sad
Im only happy when it rains
Pour your misery down pour your misery down on me
Pour your misery down pour your misery down on me
Im only happy when it rains
I feel good when things are going wrong
I only listen to the sad sad songs
Im only happy when it rains
I only smile in the dark
My only comfort is the night gone black
I didnt accidentally tell you that
Im only happy when it rains
Youll get the message by the time Im through
When I complain about me and you
Im only happy when it rains
Pour your misery down Pour your misery down
Pour your misery down on me Pour your misery down
Pour your misery down Pour your misery down
Pour your misery down on me Pour your misery down
Pour your misery down Pour your misery down
Pour your misery down on me Pour your misery down
Pour your misery down
You can keep me company
As long as you dont care
Im only happy when it rains
You wanna hear about my new obsession
Im riding high upon a deep depression
Im only happy when it rains Pour some misery down on me
Im only happy when it rains Pour some misery down on me
Im only happy when it rains Pour some misery down on me
Im only happy when it rains Pour some misery down on me
Im only happy when it rains Pour some misery down on meMetaphor for a missing moment
Pull me into your perfect circle
One womb
One shame
One resolve
Liberate this will
To release us all
Gotta cut away clear away
Slip away and sever this
Umbilical residue thats
Keeping me from killing you
And from pulling you down with me in here
I can almost hear you scream
One more medicated peaceful moment
Give me
One more medicated peaceful moment
And I dont wanna feel this overwhelming
Hostility
I dont wanna feel this overwhelming
Hostility
We gotta cut away clear away
Slip away and sever this
Umbilical residue
Gotta cut away clear away
Slip away and sever this
Umbilical residue thats
Keeping me from killing you
Slip away and sever this
Keeping me from killing youMy reflection dirty mirror
Theres no connection to myself
Im your lover Im your zero
Im the face in your dreams of glass
So save your prayers
For when youre really gonna need em
Throw out your cares and fly
Wanna go for a ride
Shes the one for me
Shes all I really need
Cause shes the one for me
Emptiness is loneliness
And loneliness is cleanliness
And cleanliness is godliness
And God is empty just like me
Intoxicated with the madness
Im in love with my sadness
Bullshit fakers enchanted kingdoms
The fashion victims chew their charcoal teeth
I never let on
That I was on a sinking ship
I never let on that I was down
You blame yourself
For what you cant ignore
You blame yourself for wanting more
Shes the one for me
Shes all I really need
Oh yes shes the one for me
Shes my one and onlyYou hold the answers deep within your own mind
Consciously youve forgotten it
Thats the way the human mind works
Whenever something is too unpleasant too shameful for us
to entertain we reject it
We erase it from our memories
But the IMPRINT is always there
Cant wash it all away
Cant Wish it all away
Cant hope it all away
Cant cry it all away
The pain that grips you
The fear that binds you
Releases life in me
In our mutual
Shame we hide our eyes
To blind them from the truth
That finds a way from who we are
Please dont be afraid
When the darkness fades away
The dawn will break the silence
Screaming in our hearts
My love for you still grows
This I do for you
Before I try to fight the truth
my final time
Were supposed to try and be real
And I feel alone and were not together And that is real
Cant wash it all away
Cant wish it all away
Cant cry it all away
Cant scratch it all away
Lying beside you
Listening to you breathe
The life that flows inside of you
Burns inside of me
Hold and speak to me
Of love without a sound
Tell me you will live through this
And I will die for you
Cast me not away
Say youll be with me
For I know I cannot
Bear it all alone
Youre not alone are you
Never Never
Cant fight it all away
Cant hope it all away
Cant scream it all away
It just wont fade away No
Cant wash it all away
Cant wish it all away
Cant cry it all away
Cant scratch it all away
Cant fight it all away
Cant hope it all away
Cant scream it all away
Ooh it all away
Ooh it all away
But the answer is always there Nothing is ever really forgotten
Please dont hate me
Cause Id die if you do
Cause Id die if you do
Cause Id die if you do
Cause Id die if you doShe embraced
With a smile
As she opened the door
A cold wind blows
It puts a chill
Into my heart
You have taken away the trust
Youre the ghost haunting through her heart
Past and present are one in her head
Youre the ghost haunting through her heart
Take my hand as I wander through
All of my life I gave to you
Take my hand as I wander through
All of my love I gave to you

When we watch cartoon cartoons Im happy as can be
I think samurai Jack is cool And Dexters laboratory
I miss watching power puff I miss watching TV
Well livin on the tour bus aint that bad
But I feel like I lost all that I have
On Cartoon Network I miss you so
On Cartoon Network where did you go
Grim and evil how I love that little brain
Johnny Bravo can I smack you once again
I hope youve learned a lesson here
Treasure what you have dont make the mistake I made
The rockstar life is sad
Well livin on the tour bus is pretty bad
And now Im sure I know the meanin of my life
The love within my soul
The reason I wake up each day and its
Cartoon Network I miss you so
My Cartoon Network where did you go
My Cartoon NetworkI dont want to say goodbye
I can see the fear inside your eyes
Its so hard to walk away
I know that this feels like the end
Life never seems to let you win
But Ill be back someday
Im already missing you
But Im not even gone
In time well be together again
And it wont be long
Now everything goes up and down
And the world keeps spinning round and round
And still youre waiting there
Ill try to make it another night
And dream of you when I close my eyes
Cause Ill be back someday
Im already missing you
But Im not even gone
In time well be together again
And it wont be long
Just hold it in
Dont let it go
Youll always live
Inside my soulWalkin around two hundred and forty-seven
waiting for you to arise
from your deadly grave
firey flames blowing in my face
burning through my skin
but how can I help it
forgive me god for I have sinned
Forgive me God
Forgive me god
For I have sinned
Im all wound up in flames
who wants to be an angel
Im hells angel
Hells Angel
Throwing flames up above
killing what I dont shove
I dont have time to be what I really am
knowing it all
catching nothing
nobody cares about me
well nobody really knows me
Im hells angel
rising down below
hating what I dont have
forgive me God
forgive me
for I have sinned
Walkin around two hundred and forty-seven
waiting for you to arise
from your deadly grave
firey flames blowing in my face
burning through my skin
but how can I help it
Its not me its my inner soul
Forgive me
Forgive me
hell raising angel
hell risin angel
Im hells angel

That i have gone down this road
Only to find that it ends
But lookin back
There is one thing that I know
I cant make it all alone again
Cause im too weak to stand on my own
But all I need is you
Chorus
So lead me
Guide me
Hold me
Hide me in love
With all that you are
and all that you do
Hear me
Take me
Mold me
Break me oh God
Just fill all of me
As i fall Into you
Just catch me as I fall
But all this time
I have felt so alone
losing myself in my despair
With loving arms
You were waiting for me to let go
With every step
you were there
Cause Im too weak to stand on my own
When all i need is you
chorus
Oh my child
How i have longed
For you to come home
to where you belong
All of your life
If you could just see
All of my joy
When you are here with me Xtwo
Hear me Take me
mold me
break me oh god
Just fill all of me
as I fall into youWhy do you cry for me
Why do you fake that you dont see me
When you change everybodys path
But you know that
One day you are going to see me with different eyes
CHORUS
I dont know if I will survive without you in my arms
Then now
Give me a chance
Let me show you how much love you
Oh I need you to survive in the darkness
Save me from the dark and from the death
If I die the love that I feel for you will ressucitateme from
The gray of the evil and dark
And the sun will shine for me again yeah
The love is indestructible against the evil
I dream that I have you with me
So tell me why do you cry for me
Come with me you wont regret it
CHORUS
Give me a chance
Let me show you how much I love you
Oh I need you to survive in the darkness
Save me from the death
CHORUS
I dont know if I will survive without you in my arms
Then now
Give me a chance
Let me show you how much I love you
Oh I need you to survive in the darkness
Save me from the dark and from the death
REPEAT CHORUS twoxHow can you see into my eyes like open doors
Leading you down into my core
Where Ive become so numb without a soul
My spirits sleeping somewhere cold
Until you find it there and lead it back home
Wake me up wake me up inside I cant wake up
Wake me up inside save me
Call my name and save me from the dark wake me up
Bid my blood to run I cant wake up
Before I come undone save me
Save me from the nothing Ive become
Now that I know what Im without
You cant just leave me
Breathe into me and make me real bring me to life
Wake me up wake me up inside I cant wake up
Wake me up inside save me
Call my name and save me from the dark wake me up
Bid my blood to run I cant wake up
Before I come undone save me
Save me from the nothing Ive become
Bring me to life Ive been living a lie
Theres nothing inside bring me to life
Frozen inside without your touch
Without your love darling
Only you are the life among the dead
All this time I cant believe I couldnt see
Kept in the dark but you were there in front of me
Ive been sleeping a thousand years it seems
Ive got to open my eyes to everything
Without a thought without a voice without a soul
Dont let me die here
There must be something wrong bring me to life
Wake me up wake me up inside I cant wake up
Wake me up inside save me
Call my name and save me from the dark wake me up
Bid my blood to run I cant wake up
Before I come undone save me
Save me from the nothing Ive become
Bring me to life Ive been living a lie theres nothing inside
Bring me to lifeLong lost words whisper slowly to me
Still cant find what keeps me here
When all this time Ive been so hollow inside
I know youre still there
Watching me wanting me
I can feel you pull me down
Fearing you loving you
I wont let you pull me down
Hunting you I can smell you - alive
Your heart pounding in my head
Watching me wanting me
I can feel you pull me down
Saving me raping me
Watching mePor favor no me preguntes como
acabe con desesperacion y quebrando
paginas rasgadas de libros que nunca leeremos
porque estamos atascados en esta rejilla
no quites el tapon justamente ahora o tendremos que vivir en serio
cuando muera ellos recordaran no lo que hice pero si lo que no he hecho
no es al fin al que le temo con cada respiro es la vida la que me asusta hasta la muerte
cuando construimos estos sueos en la arena
como nos quitaron todo de nuestras manos sin que nos dieramos cuenta
esta podria ser nuestra unica chance
vamos a tomarnos un momento de este dia
sostendr tu mano si tu sostienes la ma
el tiempo que matemos nos mantendra con vida
tus palabras no me salvaran ahora
estoy en el borde sintiendo la gota de sudor desde mi abismo
toma el poder que hay dentro de ti mismo es lo que ellos dicen
cada hora cada dia
manos sobre mis oidos he estado gritando todos estos aos
cuando muera ellos recordaran no lo que hice pero si lo que no he hecho
no es al fin al que le temo con cada respiro es la vida la que me asusta hasta la muerte

esta podria ser nuestra unica chance
vamos a tomarnos un momento de este dia
sostendr tu mano si tu sostienes la ma
el tiempo que matemos nos mantendra con vida
entramos en busca de respuestas
quedamos con las manos vacias otra vez
tiros disparados dentro del cielo estamos volviendo ahora
donde mierda te esconderas
escondiendote de las risas en el closet de nuestras vidas
pero las bisagras de la puerta estan chillando dejando pasar finos rayos de luz
y ahora una mano esta extendida del otro lado a un tranquilo comfort invitan
estamos dispuestos a tomar lo que ofrecen estamos un paso dentro de la luz
cuando muera ellos recordaran no lo que hice pero si lo que no he hecho
no es al fin al que le temo con cada respiro es la vida la que me asusta hasta la muerte
cuando construimos estos sueos en la arena

el tiempo que matemos nos mantendra con vidaEvery time we lie awake
After every hit we take
Every feeling that I get
But I havent missed you yet
Every roommate kept awake
By every sigh and scream we make
All the feelings that I get
But I still dont miss you yet
Only when I stop to think about it
I hate everything about you
Why do I love you
I hate everything about you
Why do I love you
Every time we lie awake
After every hit we take
Every feeling that I get
But I havent missed you yet
Only when I stop to think about it
I hate everything about you
Why do I love you
I hate everything about you
Why do I love you
Only when I stop to think about you
I know
Only when you stop to think about me
Do you know
I hate everything about you
Why do I love you
You hate everything about me
Why do you love me
I hate
You hate
I hate
You love me
I hate everything about you
Why do I love youYou are everything I need to see
Smile and sunlight makes sunlight to me
Laugh and come and look into me
Drips of moonlight washing over me
Can I show you what you are for me
Angel of mine can I thank you
You have saved me time and time again
Angel I must confess
Its you that always gives me strength
And I dont know where Id be without you
After all these years one thing is true
Constant voice within my heart is you
You touch me I feel Im moving into you
I treasure every day I spend with you
All the things I am come down to you
Angel of mine
Let me thank you
You have saved me time and time again
Angel I must confess
Its you that always gives me strength
And I dont know where Id be without you
Back in the arms of my angel
Back to the peace that I so love
Back in the arms of my angel I can finally rest
Giving you a gift that you remind me
Angel of mine
Let me thank you
You have saved me time and time and time and time again
Angel I must confess
Its you that always gives me strength
And I dont know where Id be without you
Angel of mine
Can I thank you
You have saved me time and time again
Angel I must confess
Its you that always gives me strength
And I dont know where Id be without you
without youPerfect by nature icons of self indulgence
Just what we all need
More lies about a world that
Never was and never will be
Have you no shame Dont you see me
You know youve got everybody fooled
Look here she comes now
Bow down and stare in wonder oh how we love you
No flaws when youre pretending but now I know she
Never was and never will be
You dont know how you betrayed me
And somehow youve got everybody fooled
Without the mask where will you hide
Cant find yourself
Lost in your lies
I know the truth and now
I know who you are
And I dont love you anymore
It never was and never will be
You dont know how you betrayed me
And somehow youve got everybody fooled
Never was and never will be
Youre not real and you cant save me
Somehow now youre everybodys foolJealous of the girl who caught your eye
One of my darker days
When you looked at her where was I
Shoulda been in her place
Here I am
All alone imagining what could have been
If I had been there
Chorus
Jealous of the one whose arms are around you
If shes keeping you satisfied
Jealous of the one who finally found you
Made your sun and your stars collide
La la la la la la la
Shes a very very lucky girl
La la la la la la la
Jealous of the one who won your heart
They say its a perfect match
Shes gonna get to be where you are
And I dont get better than that
Shell say youre fine
Whisper words I wish were mine
And they might have been
If I had been there
Repeat Chorus
You know Id fight the good fight
If I thought Id change your mind
But if she makes you happy
I would leave that dream behind
Man she better treat you right
And give you everything
Cause at the moment she doesnt
Ill be waiting in the wings
Repeat Chorus
La la la la la la la
Shes a very very lucky girlStay alive soft dark and dreamless
Far beneath my nightmares and loneliness
I hate me for breathing without you
I dont want to feel anymore for you
Grieving for you Im not grieving for you
Nothing real love cant undo
And though I may have lost my way
All paths lead straight to you
I long to be like you
Lie cold in the ground like you
Halo blinding wall between us
Melt away and leave us alone again
Humming haunted somewhere out there
I believe our love can see us through in death
I long to be like you
Lie cold in the ground like you
Theres room inside for two
And Im not grieving for you
Im coming for you
Youre not alone
No matter what they told you
Youre not alone
Ill be right beside you forevermore
I long to be like you sis
Lie cold in the ground like you did
Theres room inside for two
And Im not grieving for you
And as we lay in silent bliss
I know you remember me
I long to be like you
Lie cold in the ground like you
Theres room inside for two
And Im not grieving for you
Im coming for youI linger in the doorway
Of alarm clock screaming
Monsters calling my name
Let me stay
Where the wind will whisper to me
Where the raindrops
As theyre falling tell a story
In my field of paper flowers
And candy clouds of lullaby
I lie inside myself for hours
And watch my purple sky fly over me
Dont say Im out of touch
With this rampant chaos your reality
I know well what lies beyond my sleeping refuge
The nightmare I build my own world to escape
In my field of paper flowers
And candy clouds of lullaby
I lie inside myself for hours
And watch my purple sky fly over me
Swallowed up in the sound of my screaming
Cannot cease for the fear of silent lies
Oh how I long for the deep sleep dreaming
The goddess of imaginary light
In my field of paper flowers
And candy clouds of lullaby
I lie inside myself for hours
And watch my purple sky fly over meIve spent so much time throwing rocks at your window
That I never even knocked on the front door
I walk by statues never even made one chip
But if I could leave a mark on the monument of the heart
I just might lay myself down for a little more than I had the last day
The last day the last day the last day
Wait a time to spare these lies we tell ourselves
These days have come and gone
But this time is sweeter than honeyMy cells not ringing my doorbell isnt singing
My bed is empty Im fragile all I do is cry
Because he left me and you didnt even want me
Im lost and lonely Cant live without you
You
My cells not ringing my doorbell isnt singing
You
My bed is empty Im fragile all I do is cry
You
Because he loved me and you didnt even want me
You
Im lost and lonely Cant live without you
Chorus
You
Every beat of my heart every day of my life
You
Every thought on my mind
Every second every moment
You
Every still of the night every romance goes right
You
Every dream I deny
Every second every moment
You
Every beat of my heart every day of my life
You
Every thought on my mind
Every second every moment
You
Every tear that I cry every hope in my mind
You
Everything that I hide
Every second every moment
You eightxs
Im hearing footsteps outside my door I get up
A voice is humming a tune thats sounding like goodbye
I know Ill find you no matter where youre hiding
And so I wish for a chance to find you
You
Every beat of my heart every day of my life
You
Every thought on my mind
Every second every moment
You
Every still of the night every romance goes right
You
Every dream I deny
Every second every moment

Every tear that I cry every hope in my mind
You
Everything that I hide
Every second every moment
You
Every beat of my heart every day of my life
You
Every thought on my mind
Every second every moment twelvexs
You sixteenxsWheres the light
Killed my day
Lost in the dark of your ways
Wasted my energy endlessly
On your sweet lie
And if you dont mind
I would like to live the lie
That I will survive
And if you dont mind
I would love to slip away
And leave your world behind
Insecure Im not sure
Youre not just faking something
Wasted our last day
I cant take the pain
And if you dont mind
I would like to live the lie
That I will survive
And If you dont mind
I would love to slip away and leave it all behindNever thought that Id be leaving you today
So alone and wondering why I feel this way
So wide the world
Can love remember how to get me home to you someday
Well be together again
All just a dream in the end
Well be together again
So many fears were swimming around and around in my mind
Who would have dreamed the secrets we would find
Ive found a world where love and dreams and darkness all collide
Maybe this time we can leave our broken world behind
Well be together again
All just a dream in the endI linger in the doorway
Of alarm clock screaming monsters calling my name
Let me stay
Where the wind will whisper to me
Where the raindrops as theyre falling tell a story
In my field of paper flowers
And candy clouds of lullaby
I lie inside myself for hours
And watch my purple sky fly over me
Dont say Im out of touch
With this rampant chaos your reality
I know well what lies beyond my sleeping refuge
The nightmare I built my own world to escape
In my field of paper flowers
And candy clouds of lullaby
I lie inside myself for hours
And watch my purple sky fly over meSave your twisted enemy
So you might earn forgiveness
You know your whole world is waiting
So why cant you speak
I feel it coming over me
Im still a slave to these dreams
Is this the end of everything
Or just a new way to bleed
So go and tell all your friends
That Im a failure underneath
If it makes you feel like a bigger man
But its my my heart my life
That youre calling a lie
Ive played this game before
And I cant take anymore
I feel it coming over me
Im still a slave to these dreams
Is this the end of everything
Or just a new way to bleed
By drifting far beyond the edge
Freedom freedom
Cant you feel the ground caving in
Freedom
Give us a reason to believe again
I feel it coming over me
Im still a slave to these dreams
Is this the end of everything
Or just a new way to bleedIm dying praying bleeding and scremingIve spent so much time
Throwing rocks at your window
That I never even knocked
On your front door
I walk by statues
Never even made one chip away
But if I could leave a mark
On the monument of the heart
I just might lay myself down
For a little more than I had
The last day
The last day
The last day
Wait a time
To spare these lies we tell ourselves
These days have come and gone
But this time is sweeter than honeyStay alive soft dark and dreamless
Far beneath my nightmares and loneliness
I hate me for breathing without you
I dont want to feel anymore for you
Grieving for you Im not grieving for you
Nothing real love cant undo
And though I may have lost my way
All paths lead straight to you
I long to be like you
Lie cold in the ground like you

Melt away and leave us alone again
Humming haunted somewhere out there
I believe our love can see us through in death
I long to be like you
Lie cold in the ground like you

Youre not alone

And as we lay in silent bliss
I know you remember me
I long to be like you
Lie cold in the ground like you
Theres room inside for two
And Im not grieving for you
Im coming for youSparkling grey
There my own veins
Any more than a whisper
Any sudden movement of my heart
And I know I know
Ill have to watch them pass away
Just get through this day
Give up your way
You could be anything
Give up my way
And lose myself
Not today thats too much guilt to pay
Sickened in the sun
You dare tell me you love me
But you held me down and screamed you wanted me to die
Honey you knowyou knowId never hurt you that way
Youre just so pretty in your pain
Give up my way
And I could be anything
Ill make my own way
Without your senseless hatehatehatehate
So run run run
And hate me if it feels good
I cant hear your screams anymore
You lied to me
But Im older now
And Im not buyin baby
Demanding my response
Dont bother breaking the door down
Ive found my way out
And youll never hurt me againI cant see your star I cant see your star
Though I patiently waited bedside for the death of today
I cant see your star
The mechanical lights of Lisbon frightened it away
And Im alone now
Me and all I stood for were wandering now
All in parts and pieces swim lonely
Find your own way out
I cant see your star I cant see your star
How can the darkness feel so wrong
And Im alone now
Me and all I stood for were wandering now
All in parts and pieces swim lonely
Find your own way out
So far away
Its growing colder without your love
Why cant you feel me calling your name
Cant break the silence its breaking me
All my fears turn to rage
And Im alone now
Me and all I stood for were wandering now
All in parts and pieces swim lonely
Find your own way out now
Hey and nothing worth fighting for
Were wandering now
All in parts and pieces swim lonely
Find your own way outLithium dont want to lock me up inside
Lithium dont want to forget how it feels without
Lithium I want to stay in love with my sorrow
Oh but God I want to let it go
Come to bed dont make me sleep alone
Couldnt hide the emptiness you let it show
Never wanted it to be so cold
Just didnt drink enough to say you love me
I cant hold on to me
Wonder whats wrong with me
Lithium dont want to lock me up inside
Lithium dont want to forget how it feels without
Lithium I want to stay in love with my sorrow
Dont want to let it lay me down this time
Drown my will to fly
Here in the darkness I know myself
Cant break free until I let it go
Let me go
Darling I forgive you after all
Anything is better than to be alone
And in the end I guess I had to fall
Always find my place among the ashes
I cant hold on to me
Wonder whats wrong with me
Lithium dont want to lock me up inside
Lithium dont want to forget how it feels without
Lithium I want to stay in love with my sorrow
Oh but God I want to let it goUnder your spell again
I cant say no to you
Crave my heart and its bleeding in your hand
I cant say no to you
Shouldnt let you torture me so sweetly
Now I cant let go of this dream
I cant breathe but I feel
Good enough
I feel good enough for you
Drink up sweet decadence
I cant say no to you
And Ive completely lost myself and I dont mind
I cant say no to you
Shouldnt let you conquer me completely
Now I cant let go of this dream
Cant believe that I feel
Good enough
I feel good enough
Its been such a long time coming
But I feel good
And Im still waiting for the rain to fall
Pour real life down on me
Cause I cant hold on to anything
This good enough
Am I good enough
For you to love me too
So take care what you ask of me
Cause I cant say noYoure too important for anyone
Theres something wrong with everything you see
But I I know who you really are
Youre the one who cries when youre alone
Chorus
But where will you go
With no one left to save you from yourself
You cant escape
You cant escape
You think that I cant see right through your eyes
Scared to death to face reality
No one seems to hear your hidden cries
Youre left to face yourself alone
Chorus
I realize youre afraid
But you cant abandon everyone
You cant escape
You dont want to escape
Im so sick of speaking words that no one understands
Is it clear enough that you cant live your whole life all alone
I can hear you in a whisper
But you cant even hear me screaming
Chorus
I realize youre afraid
But you cant reject the whole world
You cant escape
You wont escape
You cant escape
You dont want to escapeCan you forgive me again
I dont know what I said
But I didnt mean to hurt you
I heard the words come out
I felt that I would die
It hurts so much to hurt you
Then you look at me
Youre not shouting anymore
Youre silently broken
Id give anything now
To kill those words for you
Each time I say something I regret
I cry I dont want to lose you
But somehow I know that you will never leave me yeah
Cause you were made for me
Somehow Ill make you see
How happy you make me Oh
I cant live this life
Without you by my side
I need you to survive
So stay with me
You look in my eyes
And Im screaming inside that Im sorry sorry
Ooh Im sorry
And you forgive me again
Youre my one true friend
And I never meant to hurt youI wanted you to be with me
For so long I dont even know by now
But now that Ive given up on you
Defiantly you see me
Walking away I see the pain
You put me through
You put me through
Lost in your game to change the same
Forever gone forever you
Theres something very wrong about this
I think you knew all along somehow
Youll only take me to change my mind
Lonely broken and defeated
So far away I see the truth
I see through you
Now that I know the way you play
I dont want to
Walking away I see the pain
You put me through
Lost in your game to change the same
Forever gone forever you
So far away I see the truth
I see through you
Now that I know the way you play
I dont want to
Walking away I see the pain
You put me through
Lost in your game to change the same
Forever gone forever youHow can I pretend that I dont see
What you hide so carelessly
I saw her bleed
You heard me breathe
And I froze inside myself and turned away
I must be dreaming
We all live we all die
That does not begin to justify you
Its not what it seems
Not what you think
No I must be dreaming
Its only in my mind
Not real life
No I must be dreaming
Help I know Ive got to tell someone
Tell them what I know youve done
I fear you but spoken fears can come true
We all live we all die
That does not begin to justify you
Its not what it seems
Not what you think
No I must be dreaming
Its only in my mind
Not real life
No I must be dreaming
We all live we all die
That does not begin to justify you
Its not what it seems
Not what you think
No I must be dreaming
Its only in my mind
Not real life
No I must be dreaming
Not what it seems
Not what you think
I must be dreaming
Just in my mind
Not real life
I must be dreamingDont cry to me if you loved me
You would be here with me
You want me come find me
Make up your mind
Should I let you fall lose it all
So maybe you can remember yourself
Cant keep believing
Were only deceiving ourselves
And Im sick of the lie
And youre too late
Dont cry to me if you loved me
You would be here with me
You want me come find me
Make up your mind
Couldnt take the blame sick with shame
Must be exhausting to lose your own game selfishly hated
No wonder youre jaded
You cant play the victim this time
And youre too late
Dont cry to me if you loved me
You would be here with me
You want me come find me
Make up your mind
You never call me when youre sober
You only want it cause its over its over
How could I have burned paradise
How could I
You were never mine
So dont cry to me if you loved me
You would be here with me
Dont lie to me just get your things
Ive made up your mindBound at every limb by my shackles of fear
Sealed with lies through so many tears
Lost from within pursuing the end
I fight for the chance to be lied to again
You never were strong enough
You you never were good enough
You were never conceived in love
You will not rise above
Theyll never see
Ill never be
Ill struggle on and on to feed this hunger
Burning deep inside of me
But through my tears breaks a blinding light
Birthing a dawn to this endless night
Arms outstretched awaiting me
An open embrace upon a bleeding tree
Rest in me and Ill comfort you
I have lived and I died for you
Abide in me and I vow to you
I will never forsake you
Theyll never see
Ill never be
Ill struggle on and on to feed this hunger
Burning deep inside of me
Theyll never see
Ill never be
Ill struggle on and on to feed this hunger
Burning deep inside of meYou dont remember my name
I dont really care
Can we play the game your way
Can I really lose control
Just once in my life
I think itd be nice
Just to lose control just once
With all the pretty flowers in the dust
Mary had a lamb
His eyes black as coals
If we play very quiet my lamb
Mary never has to know
Just once in my life
I think itd be nice
Just to lose control just once
If I cut you down to a thing I can use
I fear there will be nothing good left of you
Just to lose control just onceMeet me after dark again and Ill hold you
I want nothing more than to see you there
And maybe tonight well fly so far away
Well be lost before the dawn
If only night can hold you where I can see you my love
Then let me never ever wake again
And maybe tonight well fly so far away
Well be lost before the dawn
Somehow I know that
We cant wake again from this dream
Its not real but its ours
Maybe tonight well fly so far away
Well be lost before the dawnGive me a reason to believe that youre gone
I see your shadow so I know theyre all wrong
Moonlight on the soft brown earth
It leads me to where you lay
They took you away from me but now Im taking you home
Chorus
I will stay forever here with you
My love
The softly spoken words you gave me
Even in death our love goes on
Some say Im crazy for my love oh my love
But no bonds can hold me from your side oh my love
They dont know you cant leave me
They dont hear you singing to me
ChorusI hold my breath as this life starts to take its toll
I hide behind a smile as this perfect plan unfolds
But oh God I feel Ive been lied to
Lost all faith in the things I have achieved and I
Ive woken now to find myself
In the shadows of all that I have created
Im longing to be lost in you
Away from this place I have made
Wont you take me away from me
Crawling through this world as disease flows through my veins
I look into myself but my own heart has been changed
I cant go on like this I loathe all Ive become
Ive woken now to find myself
In the shadows of all that I have created
Im longing to be lost in you
Away from this place I have made
Wont you take me away from me
Lost in a dying world I reach for something more
I have grown so weary of this lie I live
Ive woken now to find myself
In the shadows of all that I have created
Im longing to be lost in you
I Ive woken now to find myself
Ive been lost in shadows of my own
Im longing to be lost in you away from me from me
From me from me from me
From me from me from meIs this real enough for you
You were so confused
Now that youve decided to stay
Well remain together
You cant abandon me
You belong to me
Breathe in and take my life in you
No longer myself only you
Theres no escaping me my love
Surrender
Darling theres no sense in running
You know I will find you
Everything is perfect now
We can live forever
You cant abandon me
You belong to me
Breathe in and take my life in you
No longer myself only you
Theres no escaping me my love

Listen to the rain

I stand alone in the storm
Suddenly sweet words take hold
Hurry they say For you havent much time
Open your eyes to the love around you
You may feel youre alone
But Im here still with you
You can do what you dream
Just remember to listen to the rain
Listen
Listen
Listen
How many times have you told me you love her
As many times as I wanted to tell you the truth
How long have I stood here beside you
I lived through you you looked through me
Ooo solitude
Still with me is only you
Ooo solitude
I cant stay away from you
How many times have I done this to myself
How long will it take before I see
When will this hole in my heart be mended
Who now is left alone but me
Ooo solitude
Forever me and forever you
Ooo solitude
Only you only true
Everyone leaves me stranded
Forgotten abandoned left behind
I cant stay here another night
Your secret admirer who could it be
Ooo cant you see
All along it was me
How can you be so blind
As to see right through me
And ooo solitude
Still with me is only you
Ooo solitude
I cant stay away from you
Solitude
Forever me and forever you
Ooo solitude
Only you only trueAll that Im living for
All that Im dying for
All that I cant ignore alone at night
I can feel the night beginning
Separate me from the living
Understanding me
After all Ive seen
Piecing every thought together
Find the words to make me better
If I only knew how to pull myself apart
All that Im living for
All that Im dying for
All that I cant ignore alone at night
All that Im wanted for
Although I wanted more
Lock the last open door my ghosts are gaining on me
I believe that dreams are sacred
Take my darkest fears and play them
Like a lullaby
Like a reason why
Like a play of my obsessions
Make me understand the lesson
So Ill find myself
So I wont be lost again
All that Im living for
All that Im dying for
All that I cant ignore alone at night
All that Im wanted for
Although I wanted more
Lock the last open door my ghosts are gaining on me
Guess I thought Id have to change the world
To make you see me
To be the one
I could have run forever
But how for would I have come
Without mourning your love
All that Im living for
All that Im dying for
All that I cant ignore alone at night
All that Im wanted for
Although I wanted more
Lock the last open door my ghosts are gaining on me
Should it hurt to love you
Should I feel like I do
Should I lock the last open door my ghosts are gaining on meIts true were all a little insane
But its so clear now that Im unchained

Theres nowhere to run
So lets just get it over

Youre just like me
Dont scream anymore my love
Cause all I want is you
Wake up in a dream
Frozen fear

And I dont sleep I dont sleep
See you belong to me
My snow white queen
Theres nowhere to run
So lets just get it over
Soon my love youll see
Youre just like me
Dont scream anymore my love
Cause all I want is you
Cant save your life
Though nothing I bleed for

Im losing my mind
And you just stand there
And stare as my world divides
You belong to me
My snow white queen
Theres nowhere to run
So lets just get it over
Soon my love youll see
Youre just like me
Dont scream anymore my love
Cause all I want is you
All I want is you
All I want is you
All I want is youYou dont remember me but I remember you
I lie awake and try so hard not to think of you
But who can decide what they dream
And dream I do
I believe in you
Ill give up everything just to find you
I have to be with you to live to breathe
Youre taking over me
Have you forgotten all I know
And all we had
You saw me mourning my love for you
And touched my hand
I knew you loved me then
I believe in you
Ill give up everything just to find you
I have to be with you to live to breathe
Youre taking over me
I look in the mirror and see your face
If I look deep enough
So many things inside that are just like you are taking over
I believe in you
Ill give up everything just to find you
I have to be with you to live to breathe
Youre taking over me
I believe in you
Ill give up everything just to find you
I have to be with you to live to breathe
Youre taking over me
Youre taking over meDear my love havent you wanted to be with me
And dear my love havent you longed to be free
I cant keep pretending that I dont even know you
And at sweet night you are my own
Take my hand

Theres no need to tell anyone
Theyd only hold us down
So by the morning light
Well be half way to anywhere
Where love is more than just your name
I have dreamt of a place for you and I
No one knows who we are there
All I want is to give my life only to you
Ive dreamt so long I cannot dream anymore
Lets run away Ill take you there

Where love is more than just your nameShe eyes me like a Pisces when I am weak
Ive been locked inside your heart-shaped box for weeks
Ive been drawn into your magnet tar pit trap
I wish I could eat your cancer when you turn black
Hey

Forever in debt to your priceless advice
Hey

Forever in debt to your priceless advice your advice
Meat-eating orchids forgive no one just yet

Broken hymen of your Highness Im left back
Throw down your umbilical noose so I can climb right back

Forever in debt to your priceless advice

Hey

Forever in debt to your priceless advice your advice your advice your advicePlease please forgive me
But I wont be home again
Maybe someday youll have woke up
And barely conscious youll say to no one
Isnt something missing
You wont cry for my absence I know
You forgot me long ago
Am I that unimportant
Am I so insignificant
Isnt something missing
Isnt someone missing me
Even though Im the sacrifice
You wont try for me not now
Though Id die to know you love me
Im all alone
Isnt someone missing me
Please please forgive me
But I wont be home again
I know what you do to yourself
I breathe deep and cry out
Isnt something missing
Isnt someone missing me
Even though Im the sacrifice
You wont try for me not now
Though Id die to know you love me
Im all alone
Isnt someone missing me
And if I bleed Ill bleed
Knowing you dont care
And if I sleep just to dream of you
And wake without you there
Isnt something missing
Isnt something
Even though Im the sacrifice
You wont try for me not now
Though Id die to know you love me
Im all alone
Isnt someone missing meThe words have been drained from this pencil
Sweet words that I want to give you
And I cant sleep
I need to tell you
Goodnight
When were together I feel perfect
When Im pulled away from you I fall apart
All you say is sacred to me
Your eyes are so blue
I cant look away
As we lay in the stillness
You whisper to me
Amy marry me
Promise youll stay with me
Oh you dont have to ask me
You know youre all that I live for
You know Id die just to hold you
Stay with you
Somehow Ill show you
That you are my night sky
Ive always been right behind you
Now Ill always be right beside you
So many nights I cried myself to sleep
Now that you love me I love myself
I never thought I would say this
I never thought thered be
YouIve been looking in the mirror for so long
That Ive come to believe my souls on the other side
All the little pieces falling shatter
Shards of me
Too sharp to put back together
Too small to matter
But big enough to cut me into so many little pieces
If I try to touch her
And I bleed
I bleed
And I breathe
I breathe no more
Take a breath and I try to draw from my spirits well
Yet again you refuse to drink like a stubborn child
Lie to me
Convince me that Ive been sick forever
And all of this
Will make sense when I get better
but I know the difference
Between myself and my reflection
I just cant help but to wonder
Which of us do you love
So I bleed
I bleed
And I breathe
I breathe no
Bleed
I bleed
And I breathe
I breathe
I breathe
I breathe no moreI cant run anymore
I fall before you
Here I am
I have nothing left
Though Ive tried to forget
Youre all that I am
Take me home
Im through fighting it
Broken
Lifeless
I give up
Youre my only strength
Without you
I cant go on
Anymore
Ever again
My only hope
All the times Ive tried
My only peace
To walk away from you
My only joy
My only strength
I fall into your abounding grace
My only power
My only life
And love is where I am
My only love
I cant run anymore
I give myself to you
Im sorry
Im sorry
In all my bitterness
I ignored
All thats real and true
All I need is you
When night falls on me
Ill not close my eyes
Im too alive
And youre too strong
I cant lie anymore
I fall down before you
Im sorry
Im sorry
My only hope
All the times Ive tried
My only peace
To walk away from you
My only joy
My only strength
I fall into your abounding grace
My only power
My only life
And love is where I am
My only love
Constantly ignoring
The pain consuming me
But this time its cut too deep
Ill never stray again
My only hope
All the times Ive tried
My only peace
To walk away from you
My only joy
My only strength
I fall into your abounding grace
My only power
My only life
And love is where I am
My only love
My only hope
All the times Ive tried
My only peace
To walk away from you
My only joy
My only strength
I fall into your abounding grace
My only power
My only life
And love is where I am
My only loveIf you want to live let live
If you want to go let go
Im not afraid to dream to sleep sleep forever
I dont need to touch the sky
I just want to feel that high
And you refuse to lift me
Guess it wasnt real after all
Guess it wasnt real all along
If I fall and all is lost
Its where I belong
If you want to live let live
If you want to go let go
Im never gonna be your sweet sweet surrender
Guess it wasnt real after all
Guess it wasnt real all along
If I fall and all is lost
No light to lead the way
Remember that all alone
Is where I belong
In a dream
Will you give your love to me
Beg my broken heart to beat
Save my life change my mind
If I fall and all is lost
No light to lead the way
Remember that all alone
Is where I belongGoodnight sleep tight
No more tears
In the morning Ill be here
And when we say goodnight
Dry your eyes
Because we said goodnight
And not goodbye
We said goodnight
And not goodbyeLong lost words whisper slowly to me
Still cant find what keeps me here
When all this time Ive been so hollow inside
I know youre still there
Watching me wanting me
I can feel you pull me down
Fearing you loving you
I wont let you pull me down
Hunting you I can smell you - alive
Your heart pounding in my head
Watching me wanting me
I can feel you pull me down
Saving me raping me
Watching meSparkling grey
There my own veins
Any more than a whisper
Any sudden movement of my heart
And I know I know
Ill have to watch them pass away
Just get through this day
Give up your way
You could be anything
Give up my way
And lose myself
Not today thats too much guilt to pay
Sickened in the sun
You dare tell me you love me
But you held me down and screamed you wanted me to die
Honey you knowyou knowId never hurt you that way
Youre just so pretty in your pain
Give up my way
And I could be anything
Ill make my own way
Without your senseless hatehatehatehate
So run run run
And hate me if it feels good
I cant hear your screams anymore
You lied to me
But Im older now
And Im not buyin baby
Demanding my response
Dont bother breaking the door down
Ive found my way out
And youll never hurt me againDont cry to me if you loved me
You would be here with me
You want me come find me
Make up your mind
Should I let you fall lose it all
So maybe you can remember yourself
Cant keep believing
Were only deceiving ourselves
And Im sick of the lie
And youre too late
Dont cry to me if you loved me
You would be here with me
You want me come find me
Make up your mind
Couldnt take the blame sick with shame
Must be exhausting to lose your own game selfishly hated
No wonder youre jaded
You cant play the victim this time
And youre too late
Dont cry to me if you loved me
You would be here with me
You want me come find me
Make up your mind
You never call me when youre sober
You only want it cause its over its over
How could I have burned paradise
How could I
You were never mine
So dont cry to me if you loved me
You would be here with me
Dont lie to me just get your things
Ive made up your mindMeet me after dark again and Ill hold you
I have nothing more than to see you there
And maybe tonight well fly so far away
Well be lost before the dawn
If only night could hold you where i can see you my love
Then let me never ever wake again
And maybe tonight well fly so far away
Well be lost before the dawn
Nakarat
somehow i know that we cant wake again from this dream
its not real but its ours
Maybe tonight well fly so far away
Well be lost before the dawnI still remember the world
From the eyes of a child
Slowly those feelings
Were clouded by what I know now
Where has my heart gone
An uneven trade for the real world
I want to go back to
Believing in everything and knowing nothing at all
I still remember the sun
Always warm on my back
Somehow it seems colder now
Where has my heart gone
Trapped in the eyes of a stranger
I want to go back to
Believing in everythingYoure too important for anyone
Theres something wrong with everything you see
But I I know who you really are
Youre the one who cries when youre alone
Chorus
But where will you go
With no one left to save you from yourself
You cant escape
You cant escape
You think that I cant see right through your eyes
Scared to death to face reality
No one seems to hear your hidden cries
Youre left to face yourself alone
Chorus
I realize youre afraid
But you cant abandon everyone
You cant escape
You dont want to escape
Im so sick of speaking words that no one understands
Is it clear enough that you cant live your whole life all alone
I can hear you in a whisper
But you cant even hear me screaming
Chorus
I realize youre afraid
But you cant reject the whole world
You cant escape
You wont escape
You cant escape
You dont want to escapeFeels like the weight of the world
Like God in heaven gave me a turn
Dont cling to me I swear I cant fix you
Still in the dark can you fix me
Free fall free fall all through life
If you love me then let go of me
I wont be held down by who I used to be
Shes nothing to me
Feels like the weight of the world
Like all my screaming has gone unheard
And oh I know you dont believe in me
Safe in the dark how can you see
Free fall free fall all through life
If you love me then let go of me
I wont be held down by who I used to be
If you love me then let go of me
I wont be held down by who I was
If you love me then let go of me
I wont be held down by who I used to beIve been watching you from a distance
The distance sees through your disguise
All I want from you is your hurting
I want to heal you
I want to save you from the dark
Give unto me your troubles
Ill endure your suffering
Place onto me your burden
Ill drink your deadly poison
Why should I care if they hurt you
Somehow it matters more to me
Than if I were hurting myself
Save you save you
Ill save you
Give unto me your troubles
Ill endure your suffering
Place onto me your burden
Ill drink your deadly poison
Fear not the flame of my loves candle
Let it be the sun in your world of darkness
Give unto me all that frightens you
Ill have your nightmares for you
If you sleep soundly
Give unto me your troubles
Ill endure your suffering
Place onto me your burden
Ill drink your deadly poison
Fear not the flame of my loves candle
Let it be the sun in your world of darkness
Give unto me all that frightens you
Ill have your nightmares for you
If you sleep soundly
Fear not the flame of my loves candle
Let it be the sun in your world of darknessI linger in the doorway
Of alarm clock screaming monsters calling my name
Let me stay
Where the wind will whisper to me
Where the raindrops as theyre falling tell a story
In my field of paper flowers
And candy clouds of lullaby
I lie inside myself for hours
And watch my purple sky fly over me
Dont say Im out of touch
With this rampant chaos your reality
I know well what lies beyond my sleeping refuge
The nightmare I built my own world to escape
In my field of paper flowers
And candy clouds of lullaby
I lie inside myself for hours
And watch my purple sky fly over meDont cry to me if you loved me
You would be here with me
You want me come find me
Make up your mind
Should I let you fall lose it all
So maybe you can remember yourself
Cant keep believing
Were only deceiving ourselves
And Im sick of the lie
And youre too late
Dont cry to me if you loved me
You would be here with me
You want me come find me
Make up your mind
Couldnt take the blame sick with shame
Must be exhausting to lose your own game selfishly hated
No wonder youre jaded
You cant play the victim this time
And youre too late
Dont cry to me if you loved me
You would be here with me
You want me come find me
Make up your mind
You never call me when youre sober
You only want it cause its over its over
How could I have burned paradise
How could I
You were never mine
So dont cry to me if you loved me
You would be here with me
Dont lie to me just get your things
Ive made up your mindOut on your own cold and alone again
Can this be what you really wanted baby
Blame it on me set your guilt free
Nothing can hold you back now
Now that youre gone feel like myself again
Grieving the things I cant repair and willing
To let you blame it on me and set your guilt free
I dont want to hold you back now love
I cant change who I am not this time
I wont lie to keep you near me
And in this short life theres no time to waste on giving up
My love wasnt enough
And you can blame it on me just set your guilt free honey
I dont want to hold you back now loveBound at every limb by my shackles of fear
Sealed with lies through so many tears
Lost from within pursuing the end
I fight for the chance to be lied to again
You never were strong enough
You you never were good enough
You were never conceived in love
You will not rise above
Theyll never see
Ill never be
Ill struggle on and on to feed this hunger
Burning deep inside of me
But through my tears breaks a blinding light
Birthing a dawn to this endless night
Arms outstretched awaiting me
An open embrace upon a bleeding tree
Rest in me and Ill comfort you
I have lived and I died for you
Abide in me and I vow to you
I will never forsake you
Theyll never see
Ill never be
Ill struggle on and on to feed this hunger
Burning deep inside of me
Theyll never see
Ill never be
Ill struggle on and on to feed this hunger
Burning deep inside of meWhen they all come crashing down- midflight
You know youre not the only one
When theyre so alone they find a back door out of life
You know youre not the only one
Were all grieving
Lost and bleeding
All our lives
Weve been waiting
For someone to call our leader
All your lies
Im not believing
Heaven shine a light down on me
So afraid to open your eyes- hypnotized
You know youre not the only one
Never understood this life
And youre right I dont deserve but you know Im not the only one
Were all grieving
Lost and bleeding
All our lives
Weve been waiting
For someone to call our leader
All your lies
Im not believing
Heaven shine a light down on me
Dont look down
Dont look into the eyes of the world beneath you
Dont look down youll fall down
Youll become their sacrifice
Right or wrong
Cant hold onto the fear that Im lost without you
If I cant feel Im not mine
Im not real
All our lives
Weve been waiting
For someone to call our leader
All your lies
Im not believing
Heaven shine a light down on meMy black backpack stuffed with broken dreams
Twenty bucks should get me through the week
Never said a word of discontentment
Fought it a thousand times but now Im leaving home
Here in the shadows Im safe Im free
Ive nowhere else to go
But I cannot stay where I dont belong
Two months pass by and its getting cold
I know Im not lost Im just alone
But I wont cry I wont give up I cant go back now
Waking up is knowing who you really are
Here in the shadows Im safe Im free
Ive nowhere else to go
But I cannot stay where I dont belong
In the shadows Im safe Im free
Ive nowhere else to go
But I cannot stay here
Oh show me the shadow where true meaning lies
So much more dismay in empty eyesYou hold the answers deep within your own mind
Consciously youve forgotten it
Thats the way the human mind works
Whenever something is too unpleasant too shameful for us
to entertain we reject it
We erase it from our memories
But the imprint is always there
Cant wash it all away
Cant Wish it all away
Cant hope it all away
Cant cry it all away
The pain that grips you
The fear that binds you
Releases life in me
In our mutual
Shame we idolize
To blind them from the truth
That finds a way from who we are
Please dont be afraid
When the darkness fades away
The dawn will break the silence
Screaming in our hearts
My love for you still grows
This I do for you
Before I try to fight the truth
my final time
Were supposed to try and be real
And I feel alone and were not together And that is real
Cant wash it all away
Cant wish it all away
Cant cry it all away
Cant scratch it all away
Lying beside you
Listening to you breathe
The life that flows inside of you
Burns inside of me
Hold and speak to me
Of love without a sound
Tell me you will live through this
And I will die for you
Cast me not away
Say youll be with me
For I know I cannot
Bear it all alone
Youre not alone honey
Never Never
Cant fight it all away
Cant hope it all away
Cant scream it all away
It just wont fade away No
Cant wash it all away
Cant wish it all away
Cant cry it all away
Cant scratch it all away
Cant fight it all away
Cant hope it all away
Cant scream it all away
Ooh it all away
Ooh it all away
But the imprint is always there Nothing is ever really forgotten
Please dont hate me
Cause Id die if you do
Cause Id die if you do
Cause Id die if you do
Cause Id die if you doPlayground school bell rings again
Rain clouds come to play again
Has no one told you shes not breathing
Hello Im your mind giving you someone to talk to
Hello
If I smile and dont believe
Soon I know Ill wake from this dream
Dont try to fix me Im not broken
Hello Im the lie living for you so you can hide
Dont cry
Suddenly I know Im not sleeping
Hello Im Im still here
All thats left of yesterdayNow I will tell you what Ive done for you
Fifty thousand tears Ive cried
Screaming deceiving and bleeding for you
And you still wont hear me
Im going under
Dont want your hand this time Ill save myself
Maybe Ill wake up for once
Not tormented daily defeated by you
Just when I thought Id reached the bottom
Im dying again
Im going under going under
Drowning in you drowning in you
Im falling forever falling forever
Ive got to break through Im going under
Blurring and stirring the truth and the lies
So I dont know whats real and whats not
Always confusing the thoughts in my head
So I cant trust myself anymore
Im dying again
Im going under going under
Drowning in you drowning in you
Im falling forever falling forever
Ive got to break through Im
So go on and scream
Scream at me Im so far away
I wont be broken again
Ive got to breathe I cant keep going under
Im dying again
Im going under going under
Drowning in you drowning in you
Im falling forever falling forever
Ive got to break through Im going under
Going under
Im going underSave your twisted enemy
So you might earn forgiveness
You know your whole world is waiting
So why cant you speak
I feel it coming over me
Im still a slave to these dreams
Is this the end of everything
Or just a new way to bleed
So go and tell all your friends
That Im a failure underneath
If it makes you feel like a bigger man
But its my my heart my life
That youre calling a lie
Ive played this game before
And I cant take anymore
I feel it coming over me
Im still a slave to these dreams
Is this the end of everything
Or just a new way to bleed
By drifting far beyond the edge
Freedom freedom
Cant you feel the ground caving in
Freedom
Give us a reason to believe again
I feel it coming over me
Im still a slave to these dreams
Is this the end of everything
Or just a new way to bleedThe pain that grips you the fear that binds you
Releases life in me
In our mutual shame we hide our eyes
To blind them from the truth that finds a way from who we are
Cant wash it all away
Cant wish it all away
Cant cry it all away
Cant scratch it all away
Lying beside you listening to you breathe
The light that flows inside of you burns inside of me
Hold and speak to me of love without a sound
Tell me you will live through this and
I will die for you
Cast me not away say youll be with me
For I know I cannot bear it all alone
Cant fight it all away
Cant hope it all away
Cant scream it all away
It just wont fade awayI tried to kill the pain
But only brought more
So much more
I lay dying
And Im pouring crimson regret and betrayal
Im dying
Praying
Bleeding
Screaming
Am I too lost to be saved
Am I too lost
My God My tourniquet
Return to me salvation
My God My tourniquet
Return to me salvation
Do you remember me
Lost for so long
Will you be on the other side
Will you forget me
Im dying
Praying
Bleeding
Screaming
Am I too lost to be saved
Am I too lost
My God My tourniquet
Return to me salvation
My God My tourniquet
Return to me salvation
Return to me salvation
I want to die
My God My tourniquet
Return to me salvation
My God My tourniquet
Return to me salvation
My wounds cry for the grave
My soul cries for deliverance
Will I be denied
Christ Tourniquet My suicideSave your twisted enemy
So you might earn forgiveness
You know your whole world is waiting
So why cant you speak
I feel it coming over me
Im still a slave to these dreams
Is this the end of everything
Or just a new way to bleed
So go and tell all your friends
That Im a failure underneath
If it makes you feel like a bigger man
But its my my heart my life
That youre calling a lie
Ive played this game before
And I cant take anymore
I feel it coming over me
Im still a slave to these dreams
Is this the end of everything
Or just a new way to bleed
By drifting far beyond the edge
Freedom freedom
Cant you feel the ground caving in
Freedom
Give us a reason to believe again
I feel it coming over me
Im still a slave to these dreams
Is this the end of everything
Or just a new way to bleedWay down

Underneath this skin
Waiting to hear my name again

And Ive been denying this feeling of hopelessness
In me in me
All the promises I made just to let you down
You believed in me but Im broken
I have nothing left
And all I feel is this cruel wanting
Weve been falling for all this time
And now Im lost in paradise
As much as Id like the past not to exist it still does
And as much as Id like to feel like I belong here
Im just as scared as you
I have nothing left
And all I feel is this cruel wanting
Weve been falling for all this time
And now Im lost in paradise
Run away run away
One day we wont feel this pain anymore
Take it all the way
Shadows of you
Cause they wont let me go
So I have nothing left
And all I feel is this cruel wanting
Weve been falling for all this time
And now Im lost in paradise
Alone and lost in paradiseIve been believing in something so distant as if I was human
And Ive been denying this feeling of hopelessness

Weve been falling for all this time
And now Im lost in paradise
As much as Id like the past not to exist it still does
And as much as Id like to feel like I belong here

Alone and lost in paradiseMake me whole again open your eyes
Taunted by the shadows of your lie
Cold and far away like youre not even mine
Undo everything and take me higher
Never believing what they say cause Im
Counting the days to meet you on the other side
I will always be waiting
Until the day that I see you on the other side
Come and take me home
Im not giving in I want you back
Holding together by the shards of our past
Stole my heart away I cant let you go
Break these chains and let me fly to you high above the world below
Over and over in my mind
Counting the days to meet you on the other side
I will always be waiting
Until the day that I see you on the other side
Come and take me home
I am so lost without my place inside your heart
I wont survive I need to know you hear me
Awaken and release my love
Counting the days to meet you on the other side
I will always be waiting
Until the day that I see you on the other side
Come and take me home
Counting the days to meet you on the other side
I will always be waiting
Until the day that I see you on the other side
Come and take me homeI will wander til the end of time torn away from you
I pull away to face the pain
I close my eyes and drift away
Over the fear that I will never find
A way to heal my soul
And I will wander til the end of time
Torn away from you
My heart is broken
Sweet sleep my dark angel
Deliver us from sorrows hold
Or from my hard heart
I cant go on living this way
And I cant go back the way I came
Shamed of this fear that I will never find
A way to heal my soul
And I will wander til the end of time
Half a life without you
My heart is broken
Sweet sleep my dark angel
Deliver us change open your eyes to the light
I denied it all so long oh so long
Say goodbye goodbye
My heart is broken
Release me I cant hold on
Deliver us my heart is broken
Sweet sleep my dark angel
Deliver us my heart is broken
Sweet sleep my dark angel
Deliver us from sorrows holdEmbrace the silence
Cause theres nothing that can change the way I feel
Taken all that you wanted
Now theres nothing that can change the way I feel
Hold on little girl
The end is soon to come
Sick of it all sick of it all
We will not follow
Sick of it all sick of it all
They dont understand how
Sick we are sick we are
Of this bottomless pit of lies behind closed eyes
Oceans between us
And theres nothing that can change the way I feel
I can still taste the poison of every fall
Every breath our ways to heal
Hold on little girl
The end is soon to come
Sick of it all sick of it all
We will not follow
Sick of it all sick of it all
They dont understand how
Sick we are sick we are
Of this bottomless pit of lies behind closed eyes
Someday youll know the peace
Someday the light will break through
And nothing you tell yourself
Will save us from the truth
Screamin out
Sick of it all sick of it all
We will not follow
Sick of it all sick of it all
They dont understand how
Sick we are sick we are
Of this bottomless pit of lies behind closed eyesIts taking you too long to decide
And I dont want to be the one the one
Crying over wasted time
If you think youre strong enough to let me in
Then come on stand up and be honest be honest
Im tired of feeling so alone
Cause you wont let me understand
I dont wanna pretend I wanna feel I want to love
Say you will or say you wont
Open your heart to me
Now or never tell the truth
Is this real is this real
Whenever youre around I cant fight it
You get under my skin the way that I like it
And I cant take anymore
Tell me what you want from me or leave me alone
Cause Im all caught up and Im losing control
Im tired of holding on so tight
When you wont let me understand
Now Im falling apart
I never meant to lose myself
Say you will or say you wont
Open your heart to me
Now or never tell the truth
Is this real is this real
Say you will or say you wont
Open your heart to me
Now or never tell the truth
Is this real is this real
Like drops of rain against my heart
Cut through like silver
And I want to make you feel that way
And I want to make you feel the way that I do
Say you will or say you wont
Open your heart to me
Now or never tell the truth
Is this real
Say you will or say you wont
Open your heart to me
Now or never tell the truth
Is this real is this realHollow like you dont remember me
Underneath everything I guess I always dreamed
That I would be the one to take you away
From all this wasted pain
But I cant save you from yourself
Chorus
Dont you want to feel
Dont you want to live your life
How much longer are you gonna
Give into the fear
Holding you down until youre
Frozen
I cant let you fall apart
You dont even know
What youve done to me
But I would be the one to take you away
From all this wasted pain
If you could just wake up
Chorus
All alone all alone
And drowning in your past
Take it back take it back
I still believe you can
Dont you want to feel
Dont you want to live your life How much longer are you gonna
Give into the fear
Holding you down till you disappearTurn out the lights
Feed the fire till my soul breathes free
My heart is high as the waves above me
Dont need to understand
Too lost to lose
Dont fight my tears cuz they feel so good
And I I will remember how to fly
Unlock the heavens in my mind
Follow my love back through the same secret door
Look past the end
Its a dream as its always been
All life lives on if weve ever loved it
And I I will remember how to fly
Unlock the heavens in my mind
Follow my love back through the same secret doorIts too late to change your mind
Even though this fragile world
Is tearing apart at the seams
We cant wash these sins away
This sinking feeling everyday
Im waking up in someone elses life
Is it so hard for you
Cause its so hard for me
To believe that what we dreamed
Could ever come to life again
Cause I cannot erase this lie
Not gonna let this day go by
Im gonna save this wasted life
And nothing can stand in my way
Not enough to say goodbye
Burn it til theres nothing left
Im drowning in the mess that I have made
Is it so hard for you
Cause its so hard for me
To believe that what we dreamed
Could ever come to life again
Cause I cannot erase this lie
The waters rising around us
There is no other way down
I only have myself to blame for it all
Is it so hard for you
Cause its so hard for me
To believe that what we dreamed
Could ever come to life again
If I could just erase my mind
But I cannot erase this lieDont want to be the one to walk away
But I cant bear the thought of one more day
I think I finally understand what it means to be lost
Cant find the road to lead us out of this
A million miles from where we burned the bridge
Cant keep pretending everythings going to be alright
With the whole world falling down on me
Cross the oceans in my mind
Find the strength to say goodbye
In the end you never can wash the blood from your hands
Fallen so far from where we were before
Youll never find what youve been searching for
Something to fill the void
And make up for all of those missing pieces of you
Like I could only dream to do
Cross the oceans in my mind
Find the strength to say goodbye
Everything that we believed in was a lie
Cross the oceans in your mind
Find a way to blur the line
In the end you never can wash the blood from your hands
Oh we never learn
So we fall down again
Heaven help me find a way to dream within this nightmare
Cross the oceans in my mind
Find the strength to say goodbye
Everything that we believed in was a lie
Cross the oceans in your mind
Find a way to blur the line
In the end you never can wash the blood from your handsHalfway down the stairs is a stair where I sit
There isnt any other stair quite like this
Im not at the bottom
Im not at the top
So this is the stair where I always stop
Halfway up the stairs
it isnt up it isnt down
It isnt in the Nursery it isnt in the town
And all sorts of funny thoughts
they run through my head
It isnt really anywhere
its somewhere else instead
Halfway down the stairs is a stair where I sit
There isnt any other stair quite like this
Im not at the bottom
Im not at the top
So this is the stair where I always
StopEverything is so dark
And I know theres something wrong but I cant turn the light on
In that split second change when you knew we couldnt hold on
I realized I lived to love you
Save yourself dont look back
Tearing us apart until its all gone
The only world Ive ever known sleeps beneath the waves
But I remember
I wont give up on you
I can feel you in my heart just show me the way
I dont belong here
Alone
I can still see your face
Where its burned into my mind I die every time
I close my eyes youre always there
Save yourself dont look back
Tearing us apart until its all gone
The only world Ive ever known sleeps beneath the waves
But Im the one whos drowning without your love
I am lost and I can never go back home
All across the ocean
We are calling calling
Are are you there
Nothing left for me till I find you because its
All gone the only world Ive ever known sleeps beneath the waves
But Im the one whos drowning without your love
I am lost and I can never go back
I I can never go back homeSpeak your mind
Like I care
I can see your lips moving
Ive just learned not to hear
Dont waste your time
Its never enough for you baby
Dont want to play your game anymore
No matter what you say
Im all out of love for you baby
And now that Ive tried everything
Ill numb the pain till I am made of stone
Take your time
Im not scared
Make me everything you need me to be
So the judgment seems fair
Dont waste your time
Its never enough for you baby
Dont want to play your game anymore
No matter what you say
Im all out of love for you baby
And now that Ive tried everything
Ill numb the pain till I am made to tear up my heart
For the way that it feels
I will still remember when youve long forgotten me
Its never enough for you baby
Dont want to play your game anymore
No matter what you say
Im all out of love for you baby
And now that Ive tried everything
Ill numb the pain till I am made of stone
Its never enough
Its never enough
Its never enough
Ill numb the pain till I am made of stone
Ill numb the pain till I am made of stoneI found a grave
Brushed off the face
Felt your light
I remember why I know this place
I found a bird
Closing her eyes
One last time
And I wonder if she dreamed like me
Well as much as it hurts
Aint it wonderful to feel
So go on and bring your wings
Follow your heart till it bleeds
As we run towards the end of the dream
Im not afraid
I push through the pain
And Im on fire
I remember how to breathe again
As much as it hurts
Aint it wonderful to feel
So go on and bring your wings
Follow your heart till it bleeds
As we run towards the end of the dream
Why must we fall apart to understand how to fly
I will find a way even without wings
Follow your heart till it bleeds
As we run towards the end of the dream
Follow your heart
Till it bleeds
And weve gone to the end of the dreamThought that I was strong
I know the words I need to say
Frozen in my place
I let the moment slip away
Ive been screaming on the inside
And I know you feel the pain
Can you hear me
Can you hear me
Say its over
Yes its over
But I need you anyway
Say you love me but its not enough
Never meant to lie
But Im not the girl you think you know
The more that I am with you
The more that I am all alone
Ive been screaming on the inside
And I know you feel the pain
Can you hear me
Can you hear me
Say its over
Yes its over
But I need you anyway
Say you love me but its not enough
Not that I so different
Not that I dont see
The dying light of what we used to be
But how could I forgive you
Youve changed
And Im a liar by your side
Im about to lose my mind
Cause Ive been screaming looking inside
And I know you feel the pain
Can you hear me
Can you hear me
Youve been dreaming
If youre thinking
That I still belong to you
Ive been dying
Cause Im lying to myself
Say its over
Yes its over
But I need you anyway
Say you love me but its not enoughIm so tired of being here
Suppressed by all my childish fears
And if you have to leave
I wish that you would just leave
Cause your presence still lingers here
And it wont leave me alone
These wounds wont seem to heal this pain is just too real
Theres just too much that time cannot erase
When you cried Id wipe away all of your tears
When youd scream Id fight away all of your fears
And I held your hand through all of these years
But you still have all of me
You used to captivate me by your resonating light
Now Im bound by the life you left behind
Your face it haunts my once pleasant dreams
Your voice it chased away all the sanity in me
These wounds wont seem to heal this pain is just too real
Theres just too much that time cannot erase
When you cried Id wipe away all of your tears
When youd scream Id fight away all of your fears
And I held your hand through all of these years
But you still have all of me
Ive tried so hard to tell myself that youre gone
But though youre still with me Ive been alone all along
When you cried Id wipe away all of your tears
When youd scream Id fight away all of your fears
And I held your hand through all of these years
You still have all of me me meIm so tired of being here
Suppressed by all my childish fears
And if you have to leave
I wish that you would just leave
Cause your presence still lingers here
And it wont leave me alone
These wounds wont seem to heal this pain is just too real
Theres just too much that time cannot erase
When you cried Id wipe away all of your tears
When youd scream Id fight away all of your fears
And I held your hand through all of these years
But you still have all of me
You used to captivate me by your resonating light
Now Im bound by the life you left behind
Your face it haunts my once pleasant dreams
Your voice it chased away all the sanity in me
These wounds wont seem to heal this pain is just too real

And I held your hand through all of these years
You still have all of me me meNow I will tell you what Ive done for you
Fifty thousand tears Ive cried
Screaming deceiving and bleeding for you
And you still wont hear me
Im going under
Dont want your hand this time Ill save myself
Maybe Ill wake up for once
Not tormented daily defeated by you
Just when I thought Id reached the bottom
Im dying again
Im going under going under
Drowning in you drowning in you
Im falling forever falling forever
Ive got to break through Im going under
Blurring and stirring the truth and the lies
So I dont know whats real and whats not
Always confusing the thoughts in my head
So I cant trust myself anymore
Im dying again
Im going under going under
Drowning in you drowning in you
Im falling forever falling forever
Ive got to break through Im
So go on and scream
Scream at me Im so far away

Im dying again
Im going under going under
Drowning in you drowning in you
Im falling forever falling forever
Ive got to break through Im going under
Going under
Im going underI linger in the doorway
Of alarm clock screaming
Monsters calling my name
Let me stay
Where the wind will whisper to me
Where the raindrops
As theyre falling tell a story
In my field of paper flowers
And candy clouds of lullaby
I lie inside myself for hours
And watch my purple sky fly over me
Dont say Im out of touch
With this rampant chaos your reality
I know well what lies beyond my sleeping refuge
The nightmare I build my own world to escape
In my field of paper flowers
And candy clouds of lullaby
I lie inside myself for hours
And watch my purple sky fly over me
Swallowed up in the sound of my screaming
Cannot cease for the fear of silent lies
Oh how I long for the deep sleep dreaming
The goddess of imaginary light
In my field of paper flowers
And candy clouds of lullaby
I lie inside myself for hours
And watch my purple sky fly over meIll buy you a Chevrolet Ill buy you a Chevrolet

And she taught me many many things
Good things very good things sweet things
I met her one sunny morning
It was hot but the snow lay on the ground
Strange things very strange things my mind has wings
Sandoz Sandoz who taught me love
Sandoz Sandoz heavens above
They could all learn something from your mind
Yeah baby
She is very old
You may think shes young
One kiss from her
And you know your time has comeWhite houses in neat little rows
Contrasting against the sky
Tumbled down black shacks over the tracks
Children so hungry they could cry
The chrome the steel the metal dream
Leaving the teepee to rot
The escapist young mind left behind
Saving dimes for community pot
You better get straight
Better better get straight
I feel you better get straight right now
Better get straight babe
Theyre crying out for love all the time
But they fail to see the neighbors eyes
The TV is on six o clock news
And channels in full colored lies
The company meets the president speaks
Hes young but his bones creak
Young girl dresses for the high school dance
And the guy next door is dying for a beat
Get straight you better
Yes you better get straight babe
Did you hear what I said
I said to you that you you better get straight
They put a bible in a drawer of the motel room
And its crying out to be read
But it stays right there collecting dust
No one understands whats being said
Lovers make love in country boxes
What will tomorrow bring
Theyve been told that its wrong
But they dont give a damn
Soon another life it will bring
You better get straight babe
Yeah you better get straight babyI was once out strolling one very hot summers day
When I thought Id lay myself down to rest
In a big field of tall grass
I laid there in the sun and felt it caressing my face
As I fell asleep and dreamed
I dreamed I was in a Hollywood movie
And that I was the star of the movie
This really blew my mind
The fact that me an overfed long haired leaping gnome
Should be the star of a Hollywood movie hmmm
But there I was
Hmm I was taken to a place
The hall of the mountain kings
I stood high by the mountain tops
Naked to the world
In front of
Every kind of girl
There was long ones tall ones short ones brown ones
Black ones round ones big ones crazy ones
Out of the middle came a lady
She whispered in my ear
Something crazy
She said
Spill the wine take that pearl
Spill the wine take that pearl
Spill the wine take that pearl
Spill the wine take that pearl
I could feel hot flames of fire roaring at my back
As she disappeared but soon she returned
In her hand was a bottle of wine
In the other a glass
She poured some of the wine from the bottle into the glass
And raised it to her lips
And just before she drank it she said
Take the wine dig that girl
Spill the wine dig that girl
Spill the wine dig that girl come on come on
Spill the wine dig that girl
Take that girl yeah
Its on girl all you gotta do is spill that wine
Spill that wine let me feel let me feel hot yeah yeah ooh
Spill the wine spill the wine spill the wine spill the wine
Spill the wine spill the wine spill the wine
Dig that girlThe rooms were so much colder then
My father was a soldier then
And times were very hard
When I was young
I smoked my first cigarette at ten
And for girls I had a bad yen
And I had quite a ball
When I was young
When I was young it was more important
Pain more painful
Laughter much louder
Yeah when I was young
When I was young
I met my first love at thirteen
She was brown and I was pretty green
And I learned quite a lot when I was young
When I was young
When I was young
It was more important
Pain more painful
Laughter much louder
Yeah when I was young
When I was young
My faith was so much stronger then
I believed in fellow men
And I was so much older then
When I was young
When I was young
When I was youngStrobe lights beam create dreams
Walls move minds do too
On a warm San Franciscan night
Old child young child feel alright
On a warm San Franciscan night
Angels sing leather wings
Jeans of blue Harley Davidsons too
On a warm San Franciscan night
Old angels young angels feel alright
On a warm San Franciscan night
I wasnt born there perhaps Ill die there
Theres no place left to go San Franciscan
Cops face is filled with hate
Heavens above hes on a street called love
When will they even learn
Old cop young cop feel alright
On a warm San Franciscan night
The children are cool
They dont raise fools
Its an american dream
Includes indians tooThe people came and listened
Some of them came and played
Others gave flowers away yes they did
Down in Monterey
Down in Monterey
Young Gods smiled upon the crowd
Their music being born of love
Children danced night and day
Religion was being born
Down in Monterey
The birds and the airplane did fly
Oh Ravi Shankars music made me cry
The Who exploded into fire and light
Hugh Masakelas music was black as night
The Grateful Dead blew everybodies mind
Jimi Hendrix babybelieve me set the world on fire yeah
His Majesty Prince Jones smiled as he moved among the crowd
Ten thousand electric guitars were grooving real loud yeah
You want to find the truth in life
Dont pass music by
and you know I would not lie no I would not lie
No I would not lie
Down in Monterey
Three days of understanding of moving with one another
Even the cops grooved with us
Do you believe me yeah
Down in Monterey
I think that maybe Im dreaming
Monterey
Down in monterey
Did you hear what I saidHe blesses the boys as they stand in line
The smell of gun grease
and the bayonets they shine
Hes there to help them all that he can
To make them feel wanted hes a good holy man
Sky pilot
Sky pilot
How high can you fly
Youll never never never reach the sky
He smiles at the young soldiers
Tells them its all right
He knows of their fear in the forthcoming fight
Soon therell be blood and many will die
Mothers and fathers back home they will cry
Sky pilot
Sky pilot
How high can you fly
Youll never never never reach the sky
He mumbles a prayer and it ends with a smile
The order is given
They move down the line
But hell stay behind and hell meditate
But it wont stop the bleeding or ease the hate
As the young men move out into the battle zone
He feels good with God youre never alone
He feels tired and he lays on his bed
Hopes the men will find courage
in the words that he said
Sky pilot
Sky pilot
How high can you fly
Youll never never never reach the sky
Youre soldiers of God you must understand
The fate of your country is in your young hands
May God give you strength
Do your job real well
If it all was worth it
Only time it will tell
In the morning they return
With tears in their eyes
The stench of death drifts up to the skies
A soldier so ill looks at the sky pilot
Remembers the words
Thou shalt not kill
Sky pilot
Sky pilot
How high can you fly
Youll never never never reach the skyOh see see see rider

donde nacÃ y crecÃ
y no me moverÃ
pues aquÃ morirÃ
Padre madre no me irÃ esto es lo que tengo y no me olvidarÃ
padre madre no me irÃ
este es mi barrio este es mi barrio hoy
Todo lo que quise y lo que quiero esta aquÃ
los amigos sentimientos clavados en mÃ
nada podrÃ hacerme olvidar
que Ãste es mi barrio
Ãste es mi barrio hoy
Hoy quiero recordar a los que ya no estÃn
la vida nos marcÃ³ el dolor y el honor
padre madre no me irÃ
esto es lo que tengo y no me olvidarÃ
padre madre no me irÃ
este es mi barrio
este es mi barrio hoyThey came from England
They came from France
All the way from the USA
Just to take a chance
They came from Holland
Germany Scandinavia too
The rebel citizen drivers look out
They come blasting through
And they would drive all the way
Through the pouring rain
All night and all day
Non-stop all the way
Jacking it in for the last drive jacking it in for the last drive now
Jacking it in for the last drive jacking it in for the last drive now
Outlaw motorcycle gangs joined forces with the citizen drivers
And had become the spearhead
Finding out the routes that would take them south
Away from the cold north to the sun
The rebel riders
Black Chevys Rollers and Ford Escorts too
Tanked up tuned up ready to blast clean on through
I said the riders were the spearhead they got us over the border line
And we came steaming through Amsterdam right on time
I got nothing to declare there aint nothing to be checked
But at the Franco-Russian border ten of us go wrecked
Jacking it in for the last drive jacking it in for the last drive now
Jacking it in for the last drive jacking it in for the last drive now
A family doctor in Boston Massachusetts
He made it all the way not by chance
He had a hot shot Chevy panel truck designed as an ambulance

SterlingFue lo que tenia y ahora tengo mÃs
la estrella que mas brilla pude alcanzar
y espero que me muestre a donde me llevarÃ
como el viento empuja una hoja muerta
Fuerte es el camino por recorrer hasta
esa ilusiÃ³n que tanto ansÃo ver y el la
meta encuentro y todavÃa puedo andar
el viaje mas duro serÃ
Llevo un as de espadas y un as de corazÃ³n
ambas ganan la partida de una jugada
Que rara enfermedad tendrÃ esta tierra
que lava comenzÃ³ a escupir o serÃ
que esta contenta y es su forma de reÃr
todo comienza a tener sentido
Llevo un as de espadas y un as de corazÃ³n
ambas ganan la partida de una jugada

vivir sentir morir existirMy leader told me to jump in the river
The river was deep and the weather was winter
After a sailer very kindly saved me
My leader told me youd better take it easy
I took it so easy my leader called me lazy
Through the lack of red meat
Everything was getting hazy
Friends looked at me and said
Man you gotta be crazy
Oh oh leader
My leader said son youd better get yourself together
Never mind the fools who know what were getting into
But a forty mile walk would do us both a world of good
And he sat down and watched me take off down the road
Well I walked so far my feet began to bleed
If this was good for me I just couldnt see it
A motorist picked me up and said
Look man you must be crazy
Oh oh leader
Oh oh leader
My leader came to see me in a hospital bed
Well at least I really knew that my leader really cared
After giving me a second-hand roach
He said wheres your donation man
Its all for a good cause
He left me all alone to work the riddle out
But I just couldnt make it so I began to shout
They stuck a hypodermic deep down into me
Said look out nurse I think we got a loony
Oh oh leader
Okay baby follow me now
Follow your leader
All right
Now here I sit in a state-run asylum
Limitless friendless but much more together
I decided to do some good book readin
About the art of people leadin
Now Im the leader and theyre being led
Whats the matter if theyre crazy till you hear what Ive said
Being the leader is really where its at
But just how long can a good thing last
Oh oh leader
Oh oh leader
Now listen to this baby
This is the year of the guru
Now the thing to do is to ask yourself
What can a guru do for me
Then you say to yourself
I gotta get a guruCae el trueno de la guerra otra vez
con su marcha asesina tan cruel
destruyendo la poca dignidad
que agoniza y despacio caer
cuida tu fe
sometidos el pueblo ha de pagar
por cobardes que nos han de guiar
lo que existe no se pudo escoger
esta herencia es la historia que vez
cuida tu fe
refugiados masticando el dolor
de la muerte que a sus hijos comi
sin respeto para la humanidad
agrediendo guerra por religin
cuida tu feOhohohohoh
gregorian chants
The bell tolls
The black plague has struck
Diseased eyes roll upwards
As if knowing which direction their souls will travel
bring out your dead
A woman in black cries
As the deathly procession passes by
And monks moan en masse
Ohohohohohoh
gregorian chants
The yet clean peasant pounds upon the castle door
For it is safer inside the walls
Their knocking pounds a dull tone across the quiet deserted courtyard
The bodies of unfortuates bloat in the hot sun outside the castle walls
And ones ignorant of all facts plunder the diseased corpses for remaining riches
bring out your dead
And the bell tolls on
A man walks around the castle walls on the outside
The light from his lamp dancing shadows as he moves
He tends the sick
Gives comfort to all he can for dying woman and crying man
But he feels it most for the children
unclean
Tears glisten on his cheek
Did man ever deserve this death
And not all will die just the poor
For the rich are inside the castle walls
And he knows he could be with them
And they laugh at this fool of a man
Through the stone fortress windows
And the bell tolls on
unclean
And many deaths and many days later
Many tears have been cry cried but in vain
For tears can never erase the pain of death
Only time has that talent
His hands are now blistered but this man walks on
The only element of sanity that the people look to him for answers and he answers all
And the bell tolls on inside the castle wall
bring out your dead
The dead are now buried and the plague is at its end
Life for the people flowers again
They breathe fresh air like they did once before
And there is not a sound from beyond the castle walls
The bell has stopped
And only silence is heard
And the peasants outside wonder what happened within
In their bones they feel something is wrong
The bell has been silent much too long
For many days not one soul has stirred from the stone fortress where the rich people live
No one came and no one went
Fear can do many strange things
And even though water ran low
Their mouths burnt and bellys caked dry
Not one person put a foot outside
No one had that much courage
For they feared the peasants and their world outside
So they played it safe and didnt move
But one by one they perished and diedYou know I got a letter from a friend of mine
In Newcastle upon a Tyne the other day
He said to me Eric I heard youve been havin
Some trouble down in the smoke with the girls
He said You wanna catch that flyin Scotsman
Back up here to Newcastle
Cause weve got enough females to go around up here
And I can figure you can find yourself a little somethin
And because people around here
Dont go away stealin each others loved ones
Away from one another
Like they do down there in the smoke
He also said in the letter that ah
Things dont happen like that here on Tyne
And I believed every word he said now
Things dont happen like that here on Tyne
One more thing he told me now
Things dont happen like that here on Tyne
He said to me babe
Things dont happen like that here on Tyne
He said alright alright
So Im sayin to you who are listenin
If youve been unlucky in love
And youve lost somebody love
And you hear a voice that comes to you
In the middle of the night and says
It says I want you to get on up
Listen to me I want you to get on up
And find yourself another one
If youre havin breakfast one morning
And out from behind the teapot a little voice says
Listen hey I want you to get on up now
If youre out in the mornin on your job
And a voice come to you on your job and says
Get up get up
And you know its not the foreman
Its a little voice that says
You wanna get up and walk unverified women
Go on and find yourself somebody
Thats what youd better do
Because Ill tell you one thing
Theres one thing I found out
One thing I found out
Took me a long time to find it out
Yeah it took me a long time to find out
But I think I got it now oh yeah

Pesadilla que me hunde soledad
Solo mata sin piedad
Ella es la duea de tus secretos

Pesadilla que me hunde soledad
Solo mata sin piedadAnd when I got to America I say it blew my mind

The Apollo Theater on a one hundred and twenty-fiveth street
the place was closed it was pouring rain
I had a feeling Id go there again
The taxi driver thought I was insane
Brown girl from the Bronx showed me her home
We went there by subway train
She took me there time and time again
Love was our sweet songs name
And when I got to America I say it blew my mind
And when I got to America I say it blew my mind
The Negro was my hero and leader
His strange tasting waysthey turned me on
I tried my best to sound just like him
When he moveshe moves like lightning
Across the world the news was flashed
The countrys young leader was laid to rest
Another ending of a new beginning
Others criedsome were grinning
And when I got to America I say it blew my mind
And when I got to America I say it blew my mind
In Central Park the children were playing
Behind the bars the tiger walked
Smiling young faces of many colours
Many young tongues were being talked
The garbage lying in the streets of the Village
Smiling face of an unknown Bob Dylan

She was sixteen young and so willin
The sudden violence of a Village killin
and here comes the Police as usual eh what good are you now
And when I got to America I say it blew my mind
and all ya people standing around here with your hands in your pockets
And when I got to America I say it blew my mind

Limpia este suelo magro
Sudor y sangre corre
Sobre el camino del hombre
Ansiedad motora
Sentimiento comÃºn
Disparando furia
Para que nadie estorbe
Cargar lo peor sintiendo
La ley del mundo
Ganarte un lugar se vuelve
Un trabajo duro
Jugando cartas llenas de
Esfuerzo encaras tu juego
Yendo tranquilo vemos
Mejor el terreno
OrientaciÃ³n es todo lo que
Necesitaremos para andar
Cuidadoso y bien atento
Pionero de tu propio tiempo
Atravesando como el trueno
La nube gris del silencioso valor
Orgulloso valor
Mas de lo que nos gusta
Se transforma en vicio
EmpaÃando el vidrio de la realidad
Tomando una parte
Para hacerla tuya
Descubriendo un mundo
Para engendrar tu placer
Para andarSin razn sin poesa
no hay otra cosa que yo quiera hacer
con amigos estar tocando fondo y divirtindome

Es el momento de sacar con furia y escupir
Todas las broncas contenidas
El dolor que emerge desde el interior
Es el espejo de miles de heridas
Que refleja y muestra indignacion
En este mundo insano que castiga
Sin mirar y sin pedir perdon
A los que menos tienen en la vida
Por qu
Carguemos de energa el alma
Para despojarnos de toda
Sucia corrupcin
Hoy el olvido es la excusa mas comun de usar
Para tapar las injustas acciones
De los que trabajan para maatar
Con sus discursos llenos de mentiras
Lo importante de la esencia esta
En la estructura interna que uno lleva
Jamas eso te podran quitar
Es tuyo y morira contigoSu cuerpo ya flaque y cay
ya no se pudo alzar ya no
entregado a ser uno m s
esclavo del hambre
me pregunto porqu
unos nacen as muriendo sin vivir
dolorosa visin
quien decide por l
quien decide por m
quien decide por todos
quien decide
Por favor si hay razn
analicen el mundo de hoy
sin mirar su color no olvidemos que slo hay un Dios
El suelo se reg de horror
mostrando desnutricin la soledad los abraz cerrando los ojosIm looking up 
But when I look at you Im looking down
Im looking up
at a world I left Im looking down
Im looking up
at the sky straight ahead
theres the moon the suns right behind you
If you stare it can blind you
And when you see them both together
chances are Im gonna find you looking up

Que dejÃ³ marcado el tiempo hoy
Parece que el dolor fuera con el agua purificando mi soledad
Hoy siento al respirar que el aire esta mas frÃo
Y mis ojos vuelven a brillar
El destino es el rey de mi nuevo camino
Y correrÃ a buscar
El fuego de mi pasiÃ³n
Renace y siento que
Mi cuerpo se enciende otra vez
Buscando llegar hasta el sol
La llama de nuestra ilusiÃ³n
No dejarÃ que se apague jamÃs
Otra vez estoy aquÃ
Esclavo de mi propio azar
No quiero pensar en morir asÃ
Sin antes luchar y encontrar
La luz del sol que quema y fortalecerÃ
Mi alma cansada para mantenerla en pie
Quiero ser mi juez en este cruel destino
Y nuevamente ver
El fuego de esta pasiÃ³n
Renace y siento que
Mi cuerpo se enciende otra vez
Buscando llegar hasta el sol
La llama de nuestra ilusiÃ³n
No dejarÃ que se apague jamÃsSolo con nuestro deseo
ese compaero fiel
revuelvo el oscuro cajn del recuerdo
y ahora mejor puedo ver
hoy tal vez vuelva a nacer
si encuentro en mi ser
las cuerdas que construyan la red
para no caer
despus de saltar
hay que saber volar
Miro hacia adentro
buscando cimientos donde construir
Gasto la suela llevando la idea
de cmo y porqu vivir
tan fciles fcil se va
lo malo y bueno vers
sin olvidar que despus de saltar
hay que aprender a volarEl tiempo pasa rindose

But against the sun it is dim
Jet airplanes sure travel fast
But how fast is the speed of light
And no matter how low you are
There is always somebody lower
And no matter how slow you are
There is always somebody slower
Modern day structures are fantastic
But have you seen a butterflys wings
Man has created symphony
But have you heard a blackbird sing
And no matter how dumb you are
There is always somebody dumber
And no matter how fine you are
There is always somebody finer
I am blind I am blind
But I see behind my eyes
Man can make sweet red wine
But have you tasted a mountain stream
Hollywood has created movies
But listen to the color of your dreams
And no matter how ugly you are
There is no such thing as ugly
And no matter how bad you are
There is always someone to forgive you
And no matter how fine you are
There is always somebody finer
And no matter how low you are
There is always somebody lower
And no matter how fast you are
There is always somebody faster
Faster faster faster faster faster faster and faster and faster
And slower and lower and finer and finer and slower and faster and lowerEl ltigo corta la libertad

BurdonWARSiento el reloj temblar otra vez
En la quietud que no tiene calma
Como un cristal hoy brillo de nuevo
Pero a la vez me quiebro muy fcil
Caigo y me elevo millones de veces
Slo el amor de algunos florece al verme
Gritando sin sentir miedo a nada
Siempre ser termmetro de este infierno
Fuego que invadi
Mi corazn
La tentacin
Mi paz
Sangre que inunda mis venas llenando de vida
Todo lo que anhelo
Firme sobre el suelo camino mi tiempo dejando marcadas
Las huellas de mi destino
Alzo el alma siento tocarte
Brilla un nuevo camino fiel
Alucino con repetirte
Y decir que por qu eleg
Se que el dolor mil veces florece al ver
Acrecentando lo ms natural de mi
La inmensidad envuelve este infierno gris
Y veo un cielo puro otra vezTan importante es y su descarga
ser ms grande cuando dejaron
de cuidarla estall una violencia
natural en sus aires se pondr
firme por querer despojar
a aquellos ignorantes
sabios pensantes que en
ese supuesto evolucionar
quebraron tan vitales reglas
Ya vern como se caen los pilares
del equilibrio provocando desastres
nada humano podr
con lo que se avecina
son cuatro puntos cardinales
A vengarze pues
Debern saber comprender su ser
por cambiar de piel
involucin involucin
Feroz feroz la tierra
su enojo deja caer
Han quebrantado la ley de la vida
sin mero inters de cuidar su harmona
el rumbo tomado no encuentra
un sereno final
Feroz feroz la tierra
su enojo deja caer Latinoamrica pareciera una herida abierta verdadera
muestra de sobrevivencia extrema Latinoamrica
Raza en su comp s de fuego interior
no deja que apague su calor
Sigue en pie sigue en pie firme
Respirando un clima de pobreza expresa como
un golpe bajo su naturaleza Latinoamrica
Raza en su comp s de fuego interior
no deja que apague su calor
Sigue en pie sigue en pie firmeLa maza sigue creciendo
y sobre viejas ruinas marchamos
es sangre nueva sin reglas
y nuestro paso no pensamos detener
Yendo al frente buscando algo
nunca es tarde si la causa es noble
no hay porque temer
Vamos carguemos el peso
de nuestros deseos y pongamos
todo lo que ya sabemos
Busca el viento exacto
para hacer tu vuelo
No pares no pares no pares
hasta poder hacerlo
Antes de morir debes tener
una razWhy am I lonely why do I cry
Am I gonna be a lonely one till the day that I die
Yes you dont be there while I sit here alone

Las vueltas de esta vida son inmensas al querer zafar tapar
Por ms que crea uno que lo injusto siempre al fin lo castiga Dios
Muchas veces la rueda de la vida elige el lado malo y lo hace ver mejor
Ya nada es imposible si dejamos recrear crear maldad
Lo blanco se hace oscuro en el aire fro de esta realidad
La clsica irona de mentir y no decir por qu y por quin
Hipcrita salida dando slo pena para impresionar
Hablar por qu
Sin saber bien

No es como es sin ley
Cada mentira se sabe al final
Ojo por ojo se paga igual
No es la salida correcta decir
Que uno no eligi para no sufrir para no herir
Hombre que muerde la mano de quien vio nacer
No es un hombre ms es raza que no tienen ley
La risa finge el morbo de no hacerse cargo de su propia voz
De lo que nunca tuvo que olvidarse por una firme razn
Razn que eligi la distorsin para saber tapar
Hipcrita salida dando slo penaSent que se alej de mi
Nada pudo impedir su adis
Hoy no hoy no
Reaccin tristeza sin control
El silencio me inund sin ver
Hoy no hoy no
Todo tiene su final
Alguien podr escuchar
Mi corazn llorar
Toda esta realidad
Cambi mi voda y no vuelve atrs
Nada es igual hoy todo tiene un final
El cielo te lleva ya no ver tus ojos
Quedaron mil cosas para decirte
Quizs algn da podr entenderlo todo
Hoy slo me queda recuerdo marcado en mi alma partida
Cambi mi vidaPoder all defender nuestra revolucin
Una amenaza patrones del pueblo se hicieron llamar Los que marcan el camino
Cada palabra como una granada de revolucin
Sacrificaron su mundo para drselo a los dems
Y ensearnos el camino
Ya no podemos dejar de llevarlos en cada cada actitud
NO PODEMOS OLVIDAR
Uno entre muchos millones que supo a la masa guiar llevndolo a su destino
Fueron dejando la huella profunda hacia la libertad Todo principio es una enseanza por eso ellos son Los que marcan el camino
Herencia de sabio ejemplo de vida supieron dejar
Respetados por ser nobles
Un momento de su historia
Para siempre
Vientos del alba huelen a libertad
Son los nuevos pioneros en su quieta ansiedad
Cualquiera de nosotros puede lograr

Once upon a time
There were five young guys
Hanging in and out of Newcastle
Playing Rhythm and Blues
They had nothing to lose
They didnt need that tin-pan hassle
Over the Reeperbahn where the beat was born
Shocking the heart of the nation
Sign of the times
A new search in life
Start of a new rock generation
From day one to kingdom come
Id do it all again
I used to be an animal he used to be an animal
I used to be an animal he used to be an animal
I used to be an animal whoa oh
But Im all right now
All right now baby
Twenty years ago we were children of war
But we danced to the Bo Diddley beat
There were rockers and mods
We didnt take it too hard
We had blue suede shoes on our feet
A revolution in France and James Browns dance
A new world coming our way
Wed talk that talk in the streets of New York
And never looked back to this day
From day one to the risin sun
Ill do it all again
I used to be an animal he used to be an animal
I used to be an animal he used to be an animal

We were flippin and trippin
And rockin and rollin
And generally havin a ball
For the price of a drink
There was no time to think about the morality of it all
There was freaks and queens and love-ins and has-beens
Whisky-a-gogos and all night flamingos
A psychedelic explosion in slow motion
Dr Strangeloves bomb
From day one to the risin sun
Ill do it all again whoa oh oh

I used to be an animal he used to be an animal
I used to be an animal whoa oh

Por querer llegar al sol

refugiado en la trampa
al fin quien maneja el juego
al fin quien seguir en pie

Alvina spirit woman of the rings
spirit woman from Kansas with a soul that sings
Tell me baby baby where youve been so long

Alvina with your masters eye around your neck
looked everywhere baby but I aint seen you yet
Heard you were in Africa then again Spain
Heard you went to Texas and you brought the rain
I remember you down on the boulevard
head held high proud of your gypsie heart
St Cyr took you under her wings
you grew up into a woman of the rings
I still wear your bracelet upon my wrist
I still carry the memory of your kiss
can I see you one more time just to give it back
For to give and to take is to surely be on the right track
Alvina Ill give all my lovin to you
protect you till our lives are both over and through

I felt you lay beside me Lawd you were my gypsie queenPeleando por su cultura

busco verte en una estrella cada noche
mirando me titilan tus pupilas en el cielo
sobre mi llevo el aura de nuestro respeto eterno
tan feliz lo protejoSomos salvajes perros hambrientos
buscando alimento en los hoyos
del suelo olfateando
la sucia basura encontrada
con fuertes quijadas
siempre preparada a morder
Somos la nueva cultura viva
somos mezcla de dolor y lucha
creemos en esta basta familia
que predica su sana locura
Callejera alternativa barrial
escribiendo su destino mutual
alejando lo que menos gusta
procurando no perder la calma
Las venas de evolucin

crecen cada dia mas
Rescatando las raices puras
de los reales dueos de la tierra
nos volvemos guerreros urbanos
y danzamos golpeando los cuerposNow listen here to the story of Bo Diddley
The rock n roll scene in general
Bo Diddley was born Ellis McDaniels
In a place called McCoom
In Mississippi about nineteen-twenty-sex
He moved to Chicago about ninetten-thirty-eight
Where his name was eventually changed to Bo Diddley
He practised the guitar every day and sometimes into the night
Til his papas hair began to turn white
His pa said Son listen here I know
You can stay but uh that guitars just got to go
So he pulled his hat down over his eyes
And headed on out for them western skies
I think Bob Dylan said that
He hit New York City
He began to play the Apollo in Harlem
Good scene there
Everybody raved
One day one night
Came a Cadillac four headlights
Came a man with a big long fat cigar
He said come here son Im going to make you a star
Bo Diddley said uh whats in it for me
The man said uh shut your mouth son and play the guitar
And you just wait and see
Well Bo made it he made it real big
And so did the rest of the Rock n Roll scene along with him
And a white guy called Johnny Otis took Bo Diddleys rhythm
And changed into hand jive
And it went like this
In a little old country town one day
A little old country man begin to play
Had two guitars and a beat-up saxophone
When the drummer said those cats begin to
Oh baby ooh we oh oh
Ooh la la that rock n roll
You hear me ooh we oh oh
Ooh la la that rock n roll
Then the US music scene there was big changes made
Due to circumstances beyond our control
Such as payola
The rock n roll scene died after two years of solid rock
You got discs like uh
Take good care of my baby
Please dont ever make her blue
And so forth
About uh one year later
In a place called Liverpool in England
Uh four young guys with mop haircuts
Begin to sing stuff like uh
Its been a hard days night
And Ive been workin like a dog
And so on
A place called Richmond in Surrey
Way down in the deep south
Where the guys had long hair down their backs sang
I want to be your lover baby
I want to be your man yeah
And all that jazz
Well we been doin this number Bo Diddley
For quite some time now
Bo Diddley visited this country last year
And we were playin the Club A-Go-Go in Newcastle our home town
And the doors opened one night
And to our surprise in walked the man himself Bo Diddley
Along with him was uh Jerome Green his maraca man
And the Dutchess his gorgeous sister
Now were doin uh were doin this number
Along with them came Rolling Stones and The Mersey Beats
Theyre all standin around diggin it
And I overheard Bo Diddley talkin
He turned around to Jerome Green he said
Hey Jerome what do you think of these guys doin our our material
Jerome said uh wheres the bar man
Please show me to the bar
He turned around to the Dutchess and he said
Hey Dutch what do you think of these young guys doin our material
She said ah I dont know I only came across here to see the
Changin of the guards and all that jazz
But Bo Diddley looked up at me and he said uh
With half-closed eyes and a smile
He said man took off his glasses
He said man

I joined the navy at the age of seventeen
There were lots of places I had not been
I had a dream in my head about a little Japanese girl
And it wasnt till I sailed halfway round the world
You know you know
I miss good lookin women in my home town
You know I miss warm cookin mama that you lay down
I found myself
On the frisco Bay
Getting high off the wind
A different chick every day
It wasnt till I found
Myself down Mexico way
With tears in my eyes
I was hurt to
You know Lord I said
I miss good lookin women in my home town
You know I miss the home cookin mama that you lay down
So here I am
A million miles away from home
But I really do believe someday my time will come
Then Ill return the prodigal son
Spend the rest of my days loving every single last one
Yes I miss good lookin women in my home town
Yeah you know I miss good lookin women that you lay down
You know I miss the good cookin mama that you used to lay down
You know I miss good lookin women

la estrella que mas brilla pude alcanzar
y espero que me muestre a donde me llevarÃ

Fuerte es el camino por recorrer hasta
esa ilusiÃ³n que tanto ansÃo ver y el la
meta encuentro y todavÃa puedo andar
el viaje mas duro serÃ
Llevo un as de espadas y un as de corazÃ³n
ambas ganan la partida de una jugada
Que rara enfermedad tendrÃ esta tierra
que lava comenzÃ³ a escupir o serÃ
que esta contenta y es su forma de reÃr
todo comienza a tener sentido
Llevo un as de espadas y un as de corazÃ³n
ambas ganan la partida de una jugada

RyanSterlingWell I came back to the city
And it wasnt very pretty
It was dying
There were some who had more than they could eat
And other with no shoes up on their feet
They were crying
I saw a brother sell his brother
While the cops held another
They were laughing
I saw two dogs in the street
A black one and a white one
They were fighting
If it isnt very pretty
Why do they stay in the city
And watch it dying
Why dont I go back to the country
And sit beneath a plum tree with my sweet little girl
And listen to her singin
Its because Im caught in a trap
Lord and you know where thats at
It sure aint the country
Oh Lord knows it aint the country
Its because its the way I see it every night and day
I hope to change it
Im just at city boy
City boy thats me
Hey City boy city boy
Yeah yeah city boy
Oh Lord city boy
BurdonSterlingLetter from the county farm letter from the county farm
And the wind it has been blowin
Its been blowin so strong
Theyre afraid to raise the flag less it gets torn to shreds
But God forbid the wind should ever stop blowin
But if it did
Im sure wed all fall down
But sometimes it isnt windy
Like last February
I remember it snowed
and a week later it hailed
And now it looks like raining
Now it looks like raining
Im convinced that what makes the rain and hail so heavy over here
is that the sherrif has been messing with out minds
handin out questionnaries to the prisners who are blind
to the prisners who are blind
Let me tell you one thing new at the county farm
Theyve got muzak in the fields
which makes this life of mine a little more unreal
a little more unreal
But I wish theyd kill the sounds I wish theyd kill the sounds
You dont knowwhat its like to hear Debussy in a California prison field
And I love
I love to sing while Im workin
I love to sing while Im workin
And the wind has been blowin
And the wind has been blowin
Ive given up reading for a time and taken up other pastimes
Such as watchin winos gum their food and epileptics havin bad times
More frequently Ive been lost in this game
And it looks like theyre gonna make a crimnal out of me
A criminal out of me
But those guys who are down on me winnin
Lord knows they take the game so seriously
But what hurts me more burts me more than anything
Is when I get your mail
When I get your mail theyve cut you
Theyve cut out the parts and the words that have feeling
So Im left with only part of you
I say Im only left with part of you
And the wind has been blowin
And the wind has been blowin
Oh play your guitar baby
Play your guitar baby
Get me off this farm baby take me away
And apart from all this crap there is some peace and quiet
Except for the screws grumbling and mumbling and calling me a long hair
I wouldnt mind but they cut my hair quite some time ago
They cut it off when I first came here
Which tells me Indo-China is really here behind this wire
And it soon will be dying engulfed in their own fire in their own fire
In fact they tell me that a boy like me shouldnt think like that
But this is murder and everybody accepts that
Lord knows they all accept it and everybody knows thatt aint where its at
So take care pray for rain and maybe Ill see you
Visiting hours next week
And when the screw when the screw says no touching
Lord knows Ill turn the other cheekLa unin hace la fuerza el respeto ayuda

Many rivers to cross

The winter sun was on the horizon
And we were both out of reach
She ran ahead of me looking for the next surprise
Our souls were wet yes Lord
From the incoming tide
She stopped and turned and looked at me
Lord tears in her eyes
Its only a dead bird
And its soul has gone to the sky yeah yeah
Dont you know hes free
Not like you and me
That bird is free
Not like you and me
I never ever thought you would be so out of reach
And the lonely times have been like poison child
I wish I could practise what I preach
Then I can release these feelings that Ive been
Holding deep inside
I been missing you so much baby
We only hear there can be time
By then you will have forgotten
The little dead bird on the beach
But please dont forget your father child
Because hes out of reach
I got a dream baby
And my dream is
To be free
Freedom for you and me
Im talking about freedom
Freedom for you and me
You hear my music in the wind
Hearbeat like the rolling tide
One thing you can be sure of my love
Wherever you go Ill hold your love inside
And I told her look baby
Even if he was living
And you could hold him in your hands
Youd still have to open up one of these days
And let that bird fly free
She stopped and turned and looked at me
Lord with tears in her eyes
Its only a dead bird and its soul has gone to the sky
Dont you know hes free
Freedom for you and me
Im talking about freedom freedom
Freedom for you and me
To be free

Hijos de un mismo final
Trampa de fuego y dolor
Indefensos al mirar
Como el hombre es tan feroz
Formados para morir
La esclavitud fue su ley
Aniquilando su paz
Comieron odio sin ver
Sus cuerpos llenos de horror
Arrasados sin piedad
Fueron vÃctimas del mal
Castigados porque sÃ
DueÃos del suelo y el mar
Despojados de su fe
Fueron la luna y el sol
Escudos sobre su piel
No dejemos mÃs que el tiempo
Borre de nuestras mentes
La injusta matanza de una raza que luchÃ³
Por sobrevivir
Nada podrÃ callar
El clamor el dolor la verdad
De una cultura viva
Sepultar ignorar destruir
Su herencia quedarÃ siempre aquÃ
Sagrado espÃritu fiel
Que no dejÃ³ de pelear
Por los derechos que aÃºn
No pueden recuperar
Es la nobleza su voz
Que explota como un volcÃn
Y quema con su calor
La codicia y la maldad
Hijos de un mismo final
Trampa de fuego y dolor
Indefensos al mirar
Como el hombre es tan feroz
DueÃos del suelo y el mar
Despojados de su fe
Fueron la luna y el sol

As a child I dreamed of her on the far banks of the river
I knew she could not be reached for my mind was forever wondering
Far above his head as he tried his best to teach me
The river was muddy and black black as the coal she carried
Impossible to cross many men had tried
The old sailor told me another life is lost
And here I sit with a tear in my eye the waters of Tyne in between you and I
And here I sit with a tear in my eye the waters of Tyne in between you and I
Black was the colour of my childish dreams impressions that would last
Black coal coal black pit yackas face escaping the coal dust blast
Blind pony stumblin to the light of day to retire in the green fields forever
And Ill build me a bridge of steel to beat the black river forever
Ill beat that black river forever Ill beat that muddy river forever
And here I sit with a tear in my eye the waters of Tyne in between you and I
And here I sit with a tear in my eye the waters of Tyne in between you and I

Recobramos el amor aquel de ser
Un nativo de ese barrio padre
Que tan bien nos vio crecer
El silencio de la noche
CÃ³mplice de gatos novios
Y melancolÃas
Le da nombre a una tristeza
Que liera y despiadada
Lame un dolor late un amor
Resuena en un pensamiento
Que se hace recuerdo
Aquella risa amiga
ContagiÃndome la comisura
Pareciendo verte ahora
EnseÃÃndome que el sentimiento
Rompe las fronteras
Vence la distancia
Desbaratando angustias
Por extraÃar mi gente
Sus ruidos sus colores
Sus veredas que mi caminar
Representan dando forma
A esta canciÃ³n que habla
De un buey que triste
Lame un dolor late un amor
Lame un dolor late un amor
Y comparando un poco veo la ventaja sabia
Cuando conoces tu origen
Para hablar de igual a igual
Donde quiera que estemos
Y cuando vuelva a estar con vos
Te contarÃ de todo lo bueno
Que he conocido y esperando seguirÃ
ComparÃndome a ese buey que triste

SÃ³lo por ser indios
presos de la ambiciÃ³n asesina
Inocencia y coraje
mezclados en un ser

Herederos del tiempo
forzados a ser guerreros
en armas caras pintadas

Inocencia y coraje

Me dicen que tiene una flor hermosa
Picante barata y fresca
queremos pegarle un kilito de hierba
Yo soy un gringo argentino
Venimos del suelo del Diego y el vino
En bondi de a dedo y a pata
Queremos llevarnos la planta pacasa
Cuando me trajo el bagullo
Me fui corriendo atrÃs de los yuyos
Volvimo sonrientes olor a humo
Le dije a mi Rosa tomÃ esto es tuyo

Be my pillow
Take me in and let me sleep
In the coolness of the shadow
In the silence of the deep
Darkness darkness
Hide my yearning for the things that cannot be
Keep my mind from constant turning
Towards the thing that cannot see
Thing that cannot see

Darkness darkness
Long and lonesome is the day that brings me everything
I have felt the edge of sorrow
I have known the depth of fear
Darkness darkness
Be my blanket
Trouble me with your endless night
Take away take away take away the pain of knowing
Fill the emptiness with bright
Emptiness with bright

Fill the emptiness with bright

LevingerNada que ganar caminando al borde
donde da miedo creer
jugar con errores pena del hombre
lo har desaparecer
Competimos con la furia de un volc n
viendo lo que no existe pero siempre esta
ciego a comprender cuantas verdades
ya no existen mas
busco en lo profundo de un cuerpo hueco
solo veo oscuridad
la materia vale mas que la sangre y todo se empieza a caer
nuestro tiempo apesta a intento de cambio
y solo la mierda se ve
Fin de un mundo enfermo fin de un mundo enfermo
grita con esa intencin
competimos con la furia de un volc n
viendo lo que no existe pero siempre esta
Fin de un mundo enfermo fin de un mundo enfermo
grita con esa intencinJuega con tu suerte
son tus ojos que me llaman
y me hunden en el vaco
hemos cado superados
por el espanto
el miedo fuerte y agresivo
es una oscura y turbulenta
trampa de amor
Corre corre corre
Hacia el final
ya no podemos volverOh I was born in a dump
My mama died daddy got drunk
He left me here to die or grow
In the middle of Tobacco Road

Vicios nocturnos de terror humanos recobraran vida
Se abren las puertas de mi mas cruel pesadilla
Me entrego a un viaje sin fin y caigo
Y caigo mas y mas
El momento pasa lento rodeado de oscuridad
Nauseabundos esqueletos acechndome al pasar
Desaste hoy de recuerdos y amuletos de la suerte
Cada vez esta mas cerca la horca y tu cuello sufre
Gimen voces muertas bajo la tierra
Gimen voces muertas bajo la tierra
Caigo mas y masImaginando volamos de verdad
nos podemos elevar
en la mente se encuentra el origen
de todo lo que nos empuja a vivir
nos ponemos a inventar
imaginando volamos de verdad
es como un don que no se va
alucinar un deseo y comenzar
alguna buena accin ya
el futuro nos creamos
con semillas que inventamos
el futuro nos obliga
a superar cada da
siente al volar siente al volar
prende el brillo en tus ojos
siente al volar siente al volar
sin perder el control
tanto joder tanto joder
que al final lo encontras
tironeamos de nuestras vidas

YouWell Ive been traveling over mountains
Even through the valleys too
Well Ive been traveling night and day
Running all the way
Baby trying to get to you
Ever since I read your letter
Where you said you loved me true
Ive been traveling night and day
Running all the way
Baby trying to get to you oh love
Well when I read your loving letter yeah
Then my heart began to sing
There were many miles between us baby
But they didnt mean a thing no no
If I had to do it over and over and over
Its exactly what Id do
I would travel night and day
Still run all the way
Baby trying to get to you
Hold on baby Im coming yeah
Well theres nothing that could hold me
Or could keep me away from you
When your loving letter told me baby
That you really loved me true yeah no
Well Ive just got to get to you baby
In spite of all that Ive been through
When my way was dark as night
Lord of love would shine his brightest light
When I was trying to get to you oh baby
Now Im standing in his fool box
On a lonely dessert highway
And at twenty-five cents to get to you
No chance no no
When my way was dark as night
Lord of love would shine his brightest light
When I was trying to get to you
Well Ive been traveling over mountainsYou must leave now
Take what you need you think will last
But whatever it is you think you need
You better grab it fast
Yonder stands your orphan with his gun
Crying like a fire in the sun
Look out the saints are comin through
And its all over now Baby Blue
The highway is for gamblers you better use your sense
Take what ever youve gathered from coincidence
The empty-handed painter from your streets
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets
The sky too now is falling upon you
And its all over now Baby Blue
All your seasick sailors they are rowing home
Your empty handed armies is all going home
The lover who just walked out your door
Has taken all his blankets from the floor
The carpet too is moving under you
And its all over now Baby Blue
Leave your stepping stones behind
If someone calls for you
Forget the dead youve left behind
They will not follow you
The vagabond whos rapping at your door
Is standing in the clothes that you once wore
Strike another match lets go start anew
Cause its all over now Baby Blue
Its all over now Baby Blue
Its all over Baby Blue
Its all over baby
Baby Blue
Baby Baby Blue
Its all over Baby Baby BlueI dont want you to be no slave

And I can tell by the way that you baby talk
And I know by the way that you treat your man

She came
Theres blood on the streets its up to my knee
She came
Blood on the streets in the town of Chicago
She came
Blood on the rise its following me
Think about the break of day
She came and then she drove away
Sunlight in her hair
She came
Blood in the streets runs a river of sadness
She came
Blood in the streets its up to my thigh
She came
Yeah the river runs red down the legs of the city
She came
The women are crying rivers of weepin
She came into town and then she drove away
Sunlight in her hair
Indians scattered on dawns highway bleeding
Ghosts crowd the young childs fragile eggshell mind
Blood in the streets in the town of New Haven
Blood stains the roofs and the palm trees of Venice
Blood in my love in the terrible summer
Bloody red sun of Phantastic LA
Blood screams the pain as they chop off her fingers
Blood will be born in the birth of a nation
Blood is the rose of mysterious union
Theres blood in the streets its up to my ankles
Blood in the streets its up to my knee
Blood in the streets in the town of Chicago
Blood on the rise its following meHa ha ha ha

Lets climb through the tide
Penetrate the evenin that the
City sleeps to hide
Lets swim out tonight love
Its our turn to try
Parked beside the ocean
On our moonlight drive
Lets swim to the moon
Lets climb through the tide
Surrender to the waiting worlds
That lap against our side
Nothin left open
And no time to decide
Weve stepped into a river
On our moonlight drive
Lets swim to the moon
Lets climb through the tide
You reach your hand to hold me
But I cant be your guide
Easy how to love you
As I watch you glide
Falling through wet forests
On our moonlight drive baby
Moonlight drive
Come on baby gonna take a little ride
Down down by the ocean side
Gonna get real close
Get real tight
Baby gonna drown tonight
Goin down down downLions in the street and roaming
Dogs in heat rabid foaming
A beast caged in the heart of a city
The body of his mother
Rotting in the summer ground
He fled the town
He went down South and crossed the border
Left chaos and disorder
Back there over his shoulder
One morning he awoke in a green hotel
With a strange creature groaning beside him
Sweat oozed from its shining skin
Is everybody in Is everybody in
Is everybody in
The ceremony is about to begin
Wake up
You cant remember where it was
Had this dream stopped
The snake was pale gold glazed and shrunken
We were afraid to touch it
The sheets were hot dead prisms
And she was beside me
Old shes no young
Her dark red hair the white soft skin
Now run to the mirror in the bathroom
Look shes coming in here
I cant live through each slow century of her moving
I let my cheek slide down the cool smooth tile
Feel the good cold stinging blood
The smooth hissing snakes of rain
Once I had a little game
I liked to crawl back in my brain
I think you know the game I mean
I mean the game called Go insane
You should try this little game
Just close your eyes forget your name
Forget the world forget the people
And well erect a different steeple
This little game is fun to do
Just close your eyes no way to lose
And Im right there Im going too
Release control were breaking through
Way back deep into the brain
Back where theres never any pain
And the rain falls gently on the town
And over the heads of all of us
And in the labyrinth of streams
Beneath the quiet unearthly presence of
Gentle hill dwellers in the gentle hills around
Reptiles abounding
Fossils caves cool air heights
Each house repeats a mold windows rolled
Beast car locked in against morning
All now sleeping
Rugs silent mirrors vacant
Dust Lying under the beds of lawful couples
Wound in sheets
And daughters smug
With semen eyes in their nipples
Wait
Theres been a slaughter here
Dont stop to speak or look around
Your gloves and fan are on the ground
Were getting out of town were going on the run
And youre the one I want to come
Not to touch the earth
Not to see the sun
Nothing left to do but
Run run run
Lets run lets run
House upon the hill moon is lying still
Shadows of the trees
Witnessing the wild breeze
Cmon baby run with me
Lets run
Run with me
Run with me
Run with me
Lets run
The mansion is warm at the top of the hill
Rich are the rooms and the comforts there
Red are the arms of luxuriant chairs
And you wont know a thing till you get inside
Dead Presidents corpse in the drivers car
The engine runs on glue and tar
Cmon along were not going very far
To the East to meet the Czar
Run with me
Run with me
Run with me
Lets run
Some outlaws lived by the side of the lake
The ministers daughters in love with the snake
Who lives in a well by the side of the road
Wake up girl Were almost home
We should see the gates by mornin
We should be inside by evening
Sun sun sun
Burn burn burn
Burn burn burn
I will get you
Soon soon soon
I am the lizard king
I can do anything
We came down
The rivers and highways
We came down from
Forests and falls
We came down from
Carson and Springfield
We came down from
Phoenix enthralled
And I can tell you
The names of the Kingdom
I can tell you
The things that you know
Listening for a fistful of silence
Climbing valleys into the shade
For seven years I dwelt
In the loose palace of exile
Playing strange games with the girls of the island
Now I have come again
To the land of the fair and the strong and the wise
Brothers and sisters of the pale forest
Children of night
Who among you will run with the hunt
Now night arrives with her purple legion
Retire now to your tents and to your dreams
Tomorrow we enter the town of my birth
I want to be readyNot to touch the earth not to see the sun
Nothing left to do but
Run run run
Lets run lets run
House upon the hill moon is lying still
Shadows of the trees
Witnessing the wild breeze
Cmon baby run with me lets run
Run with me
Run with me
Run with me

And her sullen and aborted
Currents breed tiny monsters
True sailing is dead
Awkward instant
And the first animal is jettisoned
Legs furiously pumping
Their stiff green gallop
And heads bob up
Poise delicate pause consent
In mute nostril agony

Then daylight brought wisdom and fever and sickness too soon
You can try to remind me instead of the other you can
You can help to insure that we all insecure our command
If you dont give a listen I wont try to tell your new hand
This is it cant you see that we all have our ends in the band
And if all of the teachers and preachers of wealth were arraigned
We could see quite a future for me in the literal sands
And if all of the people could claim to inspect such regret
Well wed have no forgiveness forgetfulness faithful remorse

We must try to find a new answer instead of a wayI really want you really do
Really need you baby God knows I do

But I loved her just the same
There was rain in our window
The FM set was ragged
But she could talk yeah
We learned to speak
And one year has gone by
Such a long long road to seek it
All we did was break and freak it
We had all that lovers ever had
We just blew it and Im not sad
Well Im mad and Im bad
And two years have gone by
Now her world was bright orange
And the fire glowed
And her friend had a baby
And she lived with us
Yeah we broke through the window
Yeah we knocked on the door
Her phone would not answer
Yeah but shes still home
Now her father has passed over
And her sister is a star
And her mother smokes diamonds
And she sleeps out in the car
Yeah but she remembers Chicago
The musicians and guitars
And grass by the lake
And people who laughed
And made her poor heart ache
Now we live down in the valley
We work out on the farm
We climb up to the mountains
And everythings fine and Im still here
And youre still there and were still aroundI wanna tell you bout Texas Radio and the Big Beat
Comes out of the Virginia swamps
Cool and slow with plenty of precision
With a back beat narrow and hard to master
Some call it heavenly in its brilliance
Others mean and ruthful of the Western dream
I love the friends I have gathered together on this thin raft
We have constructed pyramids in honor of our escaping
This is the land where the Pharaoh died
The Negroes in the forest brightly feathered
They are saying Forget the night
Live with us in forests of azure
Out here on the perimeter there are no stars
Out here we is stoned immaculate
Now listen to this and Ill tell you bout the heartache
Ill tell you bout the heartache and the loss of God
Ill tell you bout the hopeless night
The meager food for souls forgot
Ill tell you bout the maiden with wrought iron soul
Ill tell you this
No eternal reward will forgive us now for wasting the dawn
Ill tell you bout Texas Radio and the Big Beat
Soft driven slow and mad like some new language
Now listen to this and Ill tell you bout the Texas

Strange days have tracked us down
Theyre going to destroy our casual joys
We shall go on playing or find a new town yeah
Strange eyes fill strange rooms
Voices will signal their tired end
The hostess is grinning her guests sleep from sinning
Hear me talk of sin and you know this is it yeah
Strange days have found us
And through their strange hours we linger alone
Bodies confused memories misused
As we run from the day to a strange night of stoneGrandma loved a sailor who sailed the frozen sea
Grandpa was that whaler and he took me on his knee
He said Son Im goin crazy from livin on the land
Got to find my shipmates and walk on foreign sand
This old man was graceful with silver in his smile
He smoked a briar pipe and he walked for four country miles
Singin songs of shady sisters and old town liberty
Songs of love and songs of death songs that set men free hey
Ive got three ships and sixty men
A course for ports unread
Ill stand at mast let north winds blow
Till half of us are dead

Sign on the road said Take us to Madre
No one could save her save the blind tiger
He was a monster black dressed in leather
She was a princess Queen of the highway
Now they are wedded she is a good girl
Naked as children out in the meadow
Naked as children wild as can be
Soon to have offspring start it all over
Start at all over
American boy American girl
Most beautiful people in the world
Son of a frontier Indian swirl
Dancing through the midnight whirl-pool
Naked Formless I hope it can
Continue just a little while longer
Little while longer
She was a princess yeahBefore you slip into unconsciousness
Id like to have another kiss
Another flashing chance at bliss
Another kiss another kiss
The days are bright and filled with pain
Enclose me in your gentle rain
The time you ran was too insane
Well meet again well meet again
Oh tell me where your freedom lies
The streets are fields that never die
Deliver me from reasons why
Youd rather cry Id rather fly
The crystal ship is being filled
A thousand girls a thousand thrills
A million ways to spend your time
When we get back Ill drop a lineYou know the day destroys the night
Night divides the day
Tried to run
Tried to hide
Break on through to the other side
Break on through to the other side
Break on through to the other side yeah
We chased our pleasures here
Dug our treasures there
But can you still recall
The time we cried
Break on through to the other side
Break on through to the other side
Everybody loves my baby
Everybody loves my baby
She get she get
She get she get high
I found an island in your arms
Country in your eyes
Arms that chain
Eyes that lie
Break on through to the other side

Day to day hour to hour
The gate is straight
Deep and wide
Break on through to the other side

Break on through break on through
Break on through break on through
Hey hey hey hey
Hey hey hey hey heyWe can invent Kingdoms of our own
grand purple thrones those chairs of lust
love we must in beds of rust
Steel doors lock in prisoners screams
muzak AM rocks their dreams
No black mens pride to hoist the beams
while mocking angels sift what seems
To be a collage of magazine dust
Scratched on foreheads of walls of trust
This is just jail for those who must
get up in the morning fight for such
Unusable standards
While weeping maidens
Show-off penury pout
Ravings for a mad staffWait until the war is over
And were both a little older
The unknown soldier

Unborn living living dead
Bullet strikes the helmets head

Hut hut hut ho hee up

Bite the hand that feeds the lie
The garden is severed burned is the truth
Open your eyes cause God hates you
The serpents have the power coiled in illusion
A poisonous gift of beautiful sin
Paint the whore with the ashes of Eden
Its time to face the end of the world
We have flown too close to the sun
But in space even angels can get burned
As death rains down upon them
Cleansing the streets in a cloudburst of blood
Black leather smoke coils up my nostrils
Tingling with deaths surprise
It leaks out through the cracks
In the cold asphalt sidewalks of the city of sin
Feast upon the images of molten massacre
As the machineries of death grind relentlessly on
We have flown too close to the sun
But in space even angels can get burned
Lunacy breeds in silent fire
No hope for mankind as the world expireNot to touch the earth not to see the sun
Nothing left to do but
Run run run
Lets run lets run
House upon the hill moon is lying still
Shadows of the trees
Witnessing the wild breeze
Cmon baby run with me lets run
Run with me
Run with me
Run with me
Lets run
The mansion is warm at the top of the hill
Rich are the rooms and the comforts there
Red are the arms of luxuriant chairs
And you wont know a thing till you get inside
Dead Presidents corpse in the drivers car
The engine runs on glue and tar
Come on along not goin very far
To the East to meet the Czar
Run with me
Run with me
Run with me
Lets run whoa
Some outlaws lived by the side of a lake
The ministers daughters in love with the snake
Who lives in a well by the side of the road

Ya we could know we couldgently they stir gently rise
The dead are newborn awakening
With ravaged limbs and wet souls
Gently they sigh in rapt funeral amazement
Who called these dead to dance
Was it the young woman learning to play the ghost song on her baby grand
Was it the wilderness children
Was it the ghost god himself stuttering cheering chatting blindly
I called you up to anoint the earth
I called you to announce sadness falling like burned skin
I called you to wish you well
To glory in self like a new monster
And now I call you to prayYeah keep your eyes on the road your hands upon the wheel

But I tell you this man I tell you this
I dont know whats gonna happen man but I wanna have
My kicks before the whole shit house goes up in flames alrightAngels and sailors
rich girls
backyard fences
tents
Dreams watching each other narrowly
soft luxuriant cars
Girls in garages stripped
out to get liquor and clothes
half gallons of wine and six-packs of beer
Jumped humped born to suffer
made to undress in the wilderness
I will never treat you mean
Never start no kind of scene
Ill tell you every place and person that Ive been
Always a playground instructor never a killer
Always a bridesmaid on the verge of fame or over
He manouvered two girls into his hotel room
One a friend the other the young one a newer stranger
Vaguely Mexican or Puerto Rican
Poor boys thighs and buttock scarred by a fathers belt
Shes trying to rie
Story of her boyfriend of teenage stoned death games
Handsome lad dead in a car
Confusion
No connections
Come ere
I love you
Peace on earth
Will you die for me
Eat me
This way
The end
Ill always be true
Never go out sneaking out on you babe
If youll only show me Far Arden again
Im surprised you could get it up
He whips her lightly sardonically with belt
Havent I been through enough she asks
Now dressed and leaving
The Spanish girl begins to bleed
She says her period
Its Catholic heaven
I have an ancient Indian crucifix around my neck
My chest is hard and brown
Lying on stained wretched sheets with a bleeding virgin
We could plan a murder
Or start a religionIs everybody in
Is everybody in
Is everybody in
The ceremony is about to begin
Wake up
You cant remember where it was
Had this dream stoppedDid you know freedom exists in a schoolbook
Did you know madmen are running in our prison
within a jail
within a gale
within a white-free protestant maelstrom
Were perched headlong on the edge of boredom
Were reaching for death on the end of a candle
Were trying for something thats already found usCurses Invocations
Weird bate-headed mongrels
I keep expecting one of you to rise
Large buxom obese queen
Garden hogs and cunt veterans
Quaint cabbage saints
Shit hoarders and individualists
Drag strip officials
Tight lipped losers and
Lustful fuck salesman
My militant dandies
All strange orders of monsters
Hot on the tail of the woodvine
We welcome you to our procession
Here come the Comedians
look at them smile
Watch them dance an Indian mile
Look at them gesture
How aplomb
So to gesture everyone
Words dissemble
Words be quick
Words resemble walking sticks
Plant them they will grow
Watch them waver so
Ill always be a word man
Better then a bird manThe music was new
black polished chrome
And came over the summer
like liquid night
The DJs took pills to stay awake
and play for seven days
They went to the studio
And someone knew him
Someone knew the TV showman
He came to our homeroom party
and played records
And when he left in the hot noon sun
and walked to his car
We saw the chooks had written
F-U-C-K on his windshield
He wiped it off with a rag
and smiling cooly drove away
Hes rich Got a big car
My gang will get you
Scenes of rape in the arroyo
Seduction in cars abandoned buildings
Fights at the food stand
The dust
the shoes
Open shirts and raised collars
Bright sculptured hair
Hey man you want girls pills grass Cmon
I show you good time
This place has everything Cmon
I show youAwake
Shake dreams from your hair
My pretty child my sweet one
Choose the day choose the sign of your day
The days divinity
First thing you see
A vast radiant beach in a cool jeweled moon
Couples naked race down by its quiet side
And we laugh like soft mad children
Smug in the woolly cotton brains of infancy
The music and voices are all around us
Choose they croon the ancient ones
The time has come again
Choose now they croon
Beneath the moon
Beside an ancient lake
Enter again the sweet forest
Enter the hot dream
Come with us
Everything is broken up and dances
Indians scattered
On dawns highway bleeding
Ghosts crowd the young childs
Fragile eggshell mind
We have assembled inside
This ancient and insane theater
To propagate our lust for our life
And flee the swarming wisdom of the streets
The barns have stormed
The windows kept
And only one of all the rest
To dance and save us
From the divine mockery of words
Music inflames temperament
Ooh great creator of being
Grant us one more hour
To perform our art
And perfect our lives
We need great golden copulations
When true kings murders
Are allowed to roam free
A thousand musicians arise from the land
Where are the feast we are promised
One more thing
Thank you oh lord
For the white blind light
Thank you oh lord
For the white blind light
A city rises from the sea
I had a splitting headache
From witch the feature is maidLament for my cock
Sore and crucified
I seek to know you
Acquiring soulful wisdom
You can open walls of mystery
Strip show
How to acquire death in the morning show
TV death which the child absorbs
Death well mystery which makes me write
Slow train the death of my cock gives life
Forgive the poor old people who gave us entry
Taught us god in the childs praye in the night
Guitar player
Ancient wise satyr
Sing your ode to my cock
Caress its lament
Stiffen and guide us we frozen
Lost cells
The knowledge of cancer
To speak to the heart
And give the great gift
Words Power Trance
This stable friend and the beast of his zoo
Wild haired chicks
Women flowering in their summit
Monsters of skin
Each color connects
To create the boat
Which rocks the race
Could any hell be more horrible
Than now
And real
I pressed her thigh and death smiled
Death old friend
Death and my cock are the world
I can forgive my injuries in the name of
Wisdom Luxury Romance
Sentence upon sentence
Words are the healing lament
For the death of my cocks spirit
Has no meaning in the soft fire
Words got me the wound and will get me well
I you believe it
All join now and lament the death of my cock
A tongue of knowledge in the feathered night
Boys get crazy in the head and suffer
I sacrifice my cock on the alter of silenceIndians scattered on dawns highway bleeding
Ghosts crowd the young childs fragile eggshell mind
Me and my -ah- mother and father - and a
grandmother and a grandfather - were driving through
the desert at dawn and a truck load of Indian
workers had either hit another car or just - I dont
know what happened - but there were Indians scattered
all over the highway bleeding to death
So the car pulls up and stops That was the first time
I tasted fear I musta been about four - like a child is
like a flower his head is just floating in the
breeze man
The reaction I get now thinking about it looking
back - is that the souls of the ghosts of those dead
Indiansmaybe one or two of emwere just
running around freaking out and just leaped into my
soul And theyre still in there
Indians scattered on dawns highway bleeding
Ghosts crowd the young childs fragile eggshell mind
Blood in the streets in the town of New Haven
Blood stains the roofs and the palm trees of Venice
Blood in my love in the terrible summer
Bloody red sun of Phantastic LA
Blood screams her brain as they chop off her fingers
Blood will be born in the birth if a nation
Blood is the rose of mysterious union
Blood on the rise its following me
Indian Indian what did you die for
Indian says nothing at allThe World on FireTaxi from AfricaThe Grand Hotel
He was drunk a big party last night back going back
in all directions sleeping these insane hours Ill never wake up
in a good mood again Im sick of these stinky bootsThoughts in time and out of season
The Hitchhiker
Stood by the side of the road
And leveled his thumb
In the calm calculus of reason
Hi How you doin I just got back into town LA
I was out on the desert for awhile
Riders on the storm
Yeah In the middle of it
Riders on the storm
Right
Into this world were born
Hey listen man I really got a problem
Into this world were thrown
When I was out on the desert ya know
Like a dog without a bone
An actor out on loan
I dont know how to tell you
Riders on the storm
but ah I killed somebody
Theres a killer on the road
No
His brain is squirming like a toad
Its no big deal ya know
I dont think anybody will find out about it but
take a long holiday
just ah
Let your children play
this guy gave me a ride and ah
If you give this man a ride
started giving me a lot of trouble
Sweet family will die
and I just couldnt take it ya know
Killer on the road
And I wasted him
YeahWow Im sick of doubt
Live in the light of certain
South
Cruel bindings
The servants have the power
Dog-men and their mean women
Pulling poor blankets over
Our sailors
Im sick of dour faces
Staring at me from the TV
Tower I want roses in
My garden bower dig
Royal babies rubies
Must now replace aborted
Strangers in the mud
These mutants blood-meal
For the plant thats plowed
They are waiting to take us into
The severed garden
Do you know how pale and wanton thrillful
Comes death on a strange hour
Unannounced unplanned for
Like a scaring over-friendly guest youve
Brought to bed
Death makes angels of us all
And gives us wings
Where we had shoulders
Smooth as ravens
Claws
No more money no more fancy dress
This other kingdom seems by far the best
Until its other jaw reveals incest
And loose obedience to a vegetable lawresident mockery
give us an hour for magic
We of the purple glove
We of the starling light and velvet hour
We of the arabic pleasures breed
We of the sundome and the nightGive us greed
To beleive
A night of Lust
Give us trust in
The Night
Give of color
hundred huies
a rich mandala
for me and you
and your silky
pillowed house
a head wisdom
and a bed
Troubled decree
Resident mockery
has claimed thee
We used to believe
in hte good old days
We still recieve
In little ways
The things of Kindness
and unsporting brow
Forget and allow
Did you know freedom exists in a school book
Did you know madmen are running our prison
within a jail within a gaol
within a white protestant
maelstrom
Were perched headlong on the edge of boredom
Were reacing for death on the end of a candle
Were trying for something
Thats already found usI
Do you know the warm progress under the stars
Do you know we exist
Have you forgotten the keys to the Kingdom
Have you been borne yet are you alive
Lets reinvent the gods all the myths of the ages
Celebrate symbols from deep elder forests
Have you forgotten the lessons of the ancient war
We need great golden copulations
The fathers are cackling in trees of the forest
Our mother is dead in the sea
Do you know we are being led to slaughters by placid admirals
that fat slow generals are getting obscene on young blood
Do you know we are ruled by TV
The moon is a dry blood beast
Guerilla bands are rolling numbers in the next block of green vine
Amassing for warfare on innocent herdsmen who are just dying
O great creator of being grant us one more hour to perform our art perfect our lives
The moths atheists are doubly divine dying
We live we die death not ends it
Journey we more into the Nightmare
Cling to life our passiond flower
Cling to cunts cocks of despair
We got our final vision by clap
Columbus groin got filled w green death
I touched her thigh death smiled
We have assembled inside this ancient insane theatre
To propagate our lust for life flee the swarming wisdom of the streets
The barns are stormed
The windows kept only one of all the rest
To dance save us
W the divine mockery of words
Music inflames temperament
When the true Kings murderers are allowed to roam free a one thousand magicians arise in the land
Where are the feasts
We were promised
Where is the wine
The New Wine

We can invent Kingdoms of our own
Grand purple thrones those chairs of lust

Steel doors lock in prisoners screams
muzak AM rocks their dreams
No black mens pride to hoist the beams
While mocking angels sift what seems
To be a collage of magazine dust
Scratched on foreheads of walls of trust
This is just jail for those who must
Get up in the morning fight for such unusable standards
While weeping maidens show-off penury pout ravings for a mad staff
Wow Im sick of doubt
Live in the light of certain

Cruel bindings
The servants have the power dog-men their mean women
Pulling poor blankets over our sailors

To the Giant family

Great screaming Christ
Upsy-daisy
Lazy Mary will get you up upon a Sunday morning
The movie will begin in five moments
The mindless Voice announced
All those unseated will await The next show
We filed slowly languidly into the hall The auditorium was vast silent
As we seated were darkened
The Voice continued
The program for this evening is not new You have seen This entertainment thru thru
Youve seen your birth your life death you might recall all of the rest
- did you have a good world when you died - enough to base a movie on
An iron chuckle rapped our minds like a fist
Im getting out of here
Wherere you going
To the other side of the morning
Please dont chase the clouds
Pagodas temples
Her cunt gripped him
Like a warm friendly hand
Its all right
All your friends are here
When can I meet them
After youve eaten
Im not hungry
O we meant beaten
Silver stream silvery scream
Impossible concentration
Here come the comedians
Look at them smile
Watch them dance
An indian mile
Look at them gesture
How aplomb
So to gesture everyone
Words dissemble
Words be quick
Words resemble walking sticks
Plant them
They will grow
Watch them waver so
Ill always be
A word-man
Better than a birdman
But Ill charge
Wont get away
Wout lodging a dollar
Shall I say it again
Aloud you get the point
No food wout fuels gain
Ill be the irish loud
Unleashed my beak
At peak of powers
O girl unleash
Your worried comb
O worried mind
Sin in the fallen
Backwoods by the blind
She smells debt
On my new collar
Arrogant prose
Tied in a network of fast quest
Hence the obsession
Its quick to admit
Fats borrowed rhythm
Woman came between them
Women of the world unite
Make the world safe
For a scandalous life
Hee Heee
Cut your throat
Life is a joke
Your wifes in a moat
The same boat
Here comes the goat
Blood Blood Blood Blood
Theyre making a joke
Of our universe

Matchbox
Are you more real than me
Ill burn you set you free
Wept bitter tears
Excessive courtesy

A hot sick lava flowed up

He had been brainwashed for four hrs
The LT puzzled in again

No sir - was all hed say

Looking out venetian blinds

A ship leaves port
Mean horse of another thicket

Silver stream silvery scream
Oooooh impossible concentrationA military station in the desert
Can we resolve the past lurking jaws joints of time
The base to come of age in a dry place holes and caves
My friend drove and hour each day from the mountains
The bus gives you a hard-on with books in your lap
Someone shot the bird in the afternoon dance show
They gave out free records to the best couple
Spades dance best from the hipIll tell you this
No eternal reward will forgive us now
For wasting the dawn
Back in those days everything was simpler and more confused
One summer night going to the pier
I ran into two young girls
The blonde one was called Freedom
The dark one Enterprise
We talked and they told me this story
Now listen to this
Ill tell you about Texas radio and the big beat
Soft driven slow and mad
Like some new language
Reaching your head with the cold sudden fury of a divine messenger
Let me tell you about heartache and the loss of god
Wandering wandering in hopless night
Out here in the perimeter there are no stars
Out here we IS stoned
ImmaculateThe music was new
black polished chrome
And came over the summer
like liquid night
The DJs took pills to stay awake
and play for seven days
They went to the studio
And someone knew him
Someone knew the TV showman
He came to our homeroom party
and played records
And when he left in the hot noon sun
and walked to his car
We saw the chooks had written
F-U-C-K on his windshield
He wiped it off with a rag
and smiling cooly drove away
Hes rich Got a big car
My gang will get you
Scenes of rape in the arroyo
Seduction in cars abandoned buildings
Fights at the food stand
The dust
the shoes
Open shirts and raised collars
Bright sculptured hair
Hey man you want girls pills grass Cmon
I show you good time
This place has everything Cmon

long time coming long time coming
long time coming long time coming
but when you find her baby
you know you found something good
when you find somebody now
dont leave it no goodWay back deep into the brain
Way back past the realm of pain
Back where theres never any rain
And the rain falls gently on the town
And over the heads of all of us
And in the labyrinth of streams
Beneath quiet unearthly presence
Of nervous hill dwellers in the gentle hills around
Reptiles abounding
Fossils caves cool air heights
Each house repeats a mold
Windows rolled
A beast car locked in against morning
All now sleepingWha yeah cmon yeah yeah cmon yeah
Im a back door man Im a back door man
The men dont know but the little girl understand
Hey all you people that tryin to sleep
Im out to make it with my midnight dream yeah

Whoa baby Im a back door man
The men dont know
But the little girls understanddont you love her as shes walking out the door all your love is gone so sing a lonely songI wanna tell you bout Texas Radio and the Big Beat
Comes out of the Virginia swamps
Cool and slow with plenty of precision
With a back beat narrow and hard to master
Some call it heavenly in its brilliance
Others mean and ruthful of the Western dream
I love the friends I have gathered together on this thin raft
We have constructed pyramids in honor of our escaping
This is the land where the Pharaoh died
The Negroes in the forest brightly feathered
They are saying Forget the night
Live with us in forests of azure
Out here on the perimeter there are no stars
Out here we is stoned immaculate
Now listen to this and Ill tell you bout the heartache
Ill tell you bout the heartache and the loss of God
Ill tell you bout the hopeless night
The meager food for souls forgot
Ill tell you bout the maiden with wrought iron soul
Ill tell you this
No eternal reward will forgive us now for wasting the dawn
Ill tell you bout Texas Radio and the Big Beat
Soft driven slow and mad like some new language
Now listen to this and Ill tell you bout the Texas
Ill tell you bout the Texas Radio
Ill tell you bout the hopeless night
Wandering the Western dream
Tell you bout the maiden with wrought iron soulWell I just got into town about an hour ago

Or just another lost angel city of night

You know they are a liar
Drivin down your freeways
Midnight alleys roam
Cops in cars the topless bars

Little LA woman little LA woman
LA LA woman woman
LA woman cmonBorn from the blind delusional mind
Bite the hand that feeds the lie
The garden is severed burned is the truth
Open your eyes cause God hates you
The serpents have the power coiled in illusion
A poisonous gift of beautiful sin
Paint the whore with the ashes of Eden
Its time to face the end of the world
We have flown too close to the sun
But in space even angels can get burned
As death rains down upon them
Cleansing the streets in a cloudburst of blood
Black leather smoke coils up my nostrils
Tingling with deaths surprise
It leaks out through the cracks
In the cold asphalt sidewalks of the city of sin
Feast upon the images of molten massacre
As the machineries of death grind relentlessly on
We have flown too close to the sun
But in space even angels can get burned
Lunacy breeds in silent fire
No hope for mankind as the world expireAh keep your eyes on the road
Your hands upon the wheel
Keep your eyes on the road
Your hands upon the wheel
Yeah were going to the roadhouse
Gonna have a real good-time
Yeah the back of the roadhouse

Cobra-snake for a necktie
Built a house by the roadside
Made of rattlesnake hide
Brand new chimney up on top
Made out of human skulls
Come on baby take a walk with me
Tell me who do you love
Who do you love now
Who do you love now

Rode around the town with a rattlesnake whip
Come on baby dont give me no lip
Who do you love now

Were gonna have some fun tonight right
All right all rightWell Ill tell you a story of whiskey and mystics and men
And about the believers and how the whole thing began
First there were women and children obeying the moon
Then daylight brought wisdom and fever and sickness too soon
You can try to remind me instead of the other you can
You can help to insure that we all insecure our command
If you dont give a listen I wont try to tell your new hand
This is it cant you see that we all have our ends in the band
And if all of the teachers and preachers of wealth were arraigned
We could see quite a future for me in the literal sands
And if all of the people could claim to inspect such regret
Well wed have no forgiveness forgetfulness faithful remorse
So I tell you I tell you I tell you we must send away
We must try to find a new answer instead of a wayWant you to rock me
Rock me all night long
Rock me baby
Rock me all night long

Take me on your flightMy wild love went ridin
She rode all the day
She wrote to the devil
And asked him to pay
The devil was wiser
Its time to repent
He asked her to give back
The money she spent
My wild love went ridin
She rode to the sea
She gathered together
Some shells for her head
She rode and she rode on
She rode for a while
Then stopped for an evenin
And lay her head down
She rode on to Christmas
She rode to the farm
She rode to Japan
And we entered a town
By this time the river
Had changed one degree
She asked for the people
To let her go free
My wild love is crazy
She screams like a bird
She moans like a cat
When she wants to be heard
My wild love went ridin
She rode for an hour
She rode and she rested
And then she rode on
Ride cmonTake the highway to the end of the night
End of the night end of the night
Take a journey to the bright midnight
End of the night end of the night
Realms of bliss realms of light
Some are born to sweet delight
Some are born to sweet delight
Some are born to the endless night
End of the night end of the night
End of the night end of the night
Realms of bliss realms of light
Some are born to sweet delight
Some are born to sweet delight
Some are born to the endless nightWho scared you Why were you born my babe
In two-times arms with all of your charms my love
Why were you born just to play with me
To freak out or to be beautiful my dear
Load your head blow it up feeling good baby
Load your head blow it up feeling good baby ah
Well my room is so cold you know you dont have to go my babe
And if you warm it up right Im gonna love you tonight my love
Well Im glad that we came I hope youre feeling the same
Who scared you and why were you born
Please stay
I see your rider coming down the road
Got a burden carrying a heavy load
One sack of silver and one bag of goldLions in the street and roaming
Dogs in heat rabid foaming
A beast caged in the heart of a city
The body of his mother
Rotting in the summer ground
He fled the town
He went down South and crossed the border
Left the chaos and disorder
Back there over his shoulder
One morning he awoke in a green hotel
With a strange creature groaning beside him
Sweat oozed from its shiny skinWow Im sick of doubt
Live in the light of certain South
Cruel bindings
The servants have the power
Dog men and their mean women
Pulling poor blankets over our sailors
Im sick of dour faces
Staring at me from the TV tower
I want roses in my garden bower dig
Royal babies rubies must now replace
Aborted strangers in the mud
These mutants blood-meal
For the plant thats plowed
They are waiting to take us into
The severed garden
Do you know how pale and wanton thrillful
Comes death on a strange hour
Unannounced unplanned for
Like a scaring over-friendly guest
Youve brought to bed
Death makes angels of us all
And gives us wings
Where we had shoulders
Smooth as ravens claws
No more money no more fancy dress
This other kingdom seems by far the best
Until its other jaw reveals incest
And loose obedience to a vegetable law
I will not go
Prefer a feast of friends
To the giant familyMe and the devil
Walking side by side
Me and the devil
Going to take you on a long and evil ride
The woman is a devil
Thats what Ive been told
Woman is a devil
Thats what Ive been told
Shell take all your money
Then shell spend all your gold
All right
The devil is a woman
Shes a woman
Well I play my acts honey
She take the whole damn role
Keep on going now come on
All right play it yeah
One more time
Well she feel like dying
Only twenty-one
Well she feel like dying
But shes only twenty-one
Shes not the only
Shes not the only one
All right all right all right
All right all right
Gonna save the whole world
All rightLets swim to the moon
Lets climb through the tide
Penetrate the evenin that the
City sleeps to hide
Lets swim out tonight love
Its our turn to try
Parked beside the ocean
On our moonlight drive
Lets swim to the moon
Lets climb through the tide
Surrender to the waiting worlds
That lap against our side
Nothin left open
And no time to decide
Weve stepped into a river
On our moonlight drive
Lets swim to the moon
Lets climb through the tide
You reach your hand to hold me
But I cant be your guide
Easy how to love you
As I watch you glide
Falling through wet forests
On our moonlight drive baby
Moonlight drive
Come on baby gonna take a little ride
Down down by the ocean side
Gonna get real close
Get real tight
Baby gonna drown tonight
Goin down down downShe was a princess Queen of the highway
Sign on the road said Take us to Madre
No one could save her save the blind tiger
He was a monster black dressed in leather
She was a princess Queen of the highway
Now they are wedded she is a good girl
Naked as children out in the meadow
Naked as children wild as can be
Soon to have offspring start it all over
Start at all over
American boy American girl
Most beautiful people in the world
Son of a frontier Indian swirl
Dancing through the midnight whirl-pool
Formless hope it can

Hello I love you
Wont you tell me your name
Hello I love you

She holds her head so high
Like a statue in the sky
Her arms are wicked and her legs are long
When she moves my brain screams out this song
Sidewalk crouches at her feet
Like a dog that begs for something sweet
Do you hope to make her see you fool
Do you hope to pluck this dusky jewel

F-U-C-K on his windshield
He wiped it off with a rag
and smiling cooly drove away

She came
Theres blood on the streets its up to my knee
She came
Blood on the streets in the town of Chicago
She came
Blood on the rise its following me
Think about the break of day
She came and then she drove away
Sunlight in her hair
She came
Blood in the streets runs a river of sadness
She came
Blood in the streets its up to my thigh
She came
Yeah the river runs red down the legs of the city
She came
The women are crying rivers of weepin
She came into town and then she drove away
Sunlight in her hair
Indians scattered on dawns highway bleeding
Ghosts crowd the young childs fragile eggshell mind
Blood in the streets in the town of New Haven
Blood stains the roofs and the palm trees of Venice
Blood in my love in the terrible summer
Bloody red sun of Phantastic LA
Blood screams the pain as they chop off her fingers
Blood will be born in the birth of a nation
Blood is the rose of mysterious union
Theres blood in the streets its up to my ankles
Blood in the streets its up to my knee
Blood in the streets in the town of Chicago
Blood on the rise its following meSomeday soon someday soon
Familiar freaks will fill your living room
Rugs lash out their lizard tongues
Youre not getting young youre not getting young
But youre going to die
And youre going to be needing all of your eyes
Youll be all alone
When the animals cry
All by yourself
In some infancys lie
Someday soon someday soon
Television bleeding like a harvest moon
Flush the scissors down the hole
Youre getting old youre getting old
And I hate to remind you but youre going to die
And youre going to be needing all of your lies
Youll be all alone
When the animals cry
All by yourself
In some infancys lie
Someday soon
Someday soon
Someday soon
Someday soonYoure on a tightrope ride nobody by your side
Well youre all alone gotta find a new home
Dont go over the line You better keep on time
Or youll lose your mind on your tightrope ride
Watch out dont fall Careful dont slip
You better get your balance you have to feel the way
There are no more questions no answers today
There are no reasons there are no more rhymes
But if you feel it you can fly next time
You can fly next time or maybe this time
Did you think we were all together
Did you think we were all the same
Did you think maybe I could help you
Remember your name remember the game
Whats the name of the game
Its a very good game never stays the same
Its the number one from mud to sun
Youre on a tightrope ride were all by your side
But youre all alone and were going home
And were by your side but youre all alone
Like a Rolling Stone like Brian Jones
On a tightrope rideLions in the street and roaming
Dogs in heat rabid foaming
A beast caged in the heart of a city
The body of his mother
Rotting in the summer ground
He fled the town
He went down South and crossed the border
Left chaos and disorder
Back there over his shoulder
One morning he awoke in a green hotel
With a strange creature groaning beside him
Sweat oozed from its shining skin
Is everybody in Is everybody in
Is everybody in
The ceremony is about to begin
Wake up
You cant remember where it was
Had this dream stopped
The snake was pale gold glazed and shrunken
We were afraid to touch it
The sheets were hot dead prisms
And she was beside me
Old shes no young
Her dark red hair the white soft skin
Now run to the mirror in the bathroom
Look shes coming in here
I cant live through each slow century of her moving
I let my cheek slide down the cool smooth tile
Feel the good cold stinging blood
The smooth hissing snakes of rain
Once I had a little game
I liked to crawl back in my brain
I think you know the game I mean
I mean the game called Go insane
You should try this little game
Just close your eyes forget your name
Forget the world forget the people
And well erect a different steeple
This little game is fun to do
Just close your eyes no way to lose
And Im right there Im going too
Release control were breaking through
Way back deep into the brain
Back where theres never any pain
And the rain falls gently on the town
And over the heads of all of us
And in the labyrinth of streams
Beneath the quiet unearthly presence of
Gentle hill dwellers in the gentle hills around
Reptiles abounding
Fossils caves cool air heights
Each house repeats a mold windows rolled
Beast car locked in against morning
All now sleeping
Rugs silent mirrors vacant
Dust Lying under the beds of lawful couples
Wound in sheets
And daughters smug
With semen eyes in their nipples
Wait
Theres been a slaughter here
Dont stop to speak or look around
Your gloves and fan are on the ground
Were getting out of town were going on the run
And youre the one I want to come
Not to touch the earth
Not to see the sun
Nothing left to do but
Run run run
Lets run lets run
House upon the hill moon is lying still
Shadows of the trees
Witnessing the wild breeze
Cmon baby run with me
Lets run
Run with me
Run with me
Run with me
Lets run
The mansion is warm at the top of the hill
Rich are the rooms and the comforts there
Red are the arms of luxuriant chairs
And you wont know a thing till you get inside
Dead Presidents corpse in the drivers car
The engine runs on glue and tar
Cmon along were not going very far
To the East to meet the Czar
Run with me
Run with me
Run with me
Lets run
Some outlaws lived by the side of the lake
The ministers daughters in love with the snake
Who lives in a well by the side of the road
Wake up girl Were almost home
We should see the gates by mornin
We should be inside by evening
Sun sun sun
Burn burn burn
Burn burn burn
I will get you
Soon soon soon
I am the lizard king
I can do anything
We came down
The rivers and highways
We came down from
Forests and falls
We came down from
Carson and Springfield
We came down from
Phoenix enthralled
And I can tell you
The names of the Kingdom
I can tell you
The things that you know
Listening for a fistful of silence
Climbing valleys into the shade
For seven years I dwelt
In the loose palace of exile
Playing strange games with the girls of the island
Now I have come again
To the land of the fair and the strong and the wise
Brothers and sisters of the pale forest
Children of night
Who among you will run with the hunt
Now night arrives with her purple legion
Retire now to your tents and to your dreams
Tomorrow we enter the town of my birth
I want to be readyCapeheartCochran

Gazing on a city under television skies

Memorize your alleys on an endless roll
Endless roll endless roll endless roll
Endless roll endless roll endless roll

So get yourselves together and quit messing around no more nonsense
The assassination occurred at three hundred and thirty no one was there to witness it
Even the breviaries had left their tapestries on the window
And we were all silenced by the sad mildew cloud that followed around
I wish I was back in the land of the of the aahm uhm
You cant pin that one on me I didnt do a goddamn thing
I was just standing there then a bunch of guys came up
And started laying all this shit on me now what am I supposed to do
Im an American You cant touch me
Did you know all nuns are forty-two And their eyes are blue
Did you know all table clothes are white in France
Did you know women wear underpants
Well they do
How does a musician imitate the sound of underpants sliding
Over a womans thighs down over her ankles
And over her little toes And the rings on her toes
And her unequipped toe nails
Lightning struck the magic purse I didnt do a damn thing man
I was just standing there in front of the Delicatessen
And all these rabbies ran up and a bunch of Indians and freaks
And monsters and unverified just started mhmh
Talking in all these weird languages what aah what could I say
Hey Im tired of being a freaky musician I wanna be Napoleon
Lets have some more wars around here
What a stinking shitty little war we have running over there
Lets get a big one A real big one
With a lotta killings and bombs and blood
School days school days
Good old-fashioned rule days
School days school days
Good old-fashioned rule daysThen we hear a whistle like a bisons pipe
And the carnival immediately begins
Gradually mixing rain
Thunder
Bullfight
Football
Playground
War
Penny-arcade
Babylon FadingLove hides in the strangest places
Love hides in familiar faces
Love hides in narrow corners
Love hides in molecular structures
Love comes when you least expect it
Love comes to those who seek it
Love hides inside the rainbow
Love is everything yeahAll right listen now At this time I would like to introduce a friend of ours
a very talented guy named John Sebastian Come on man
Man thats what I call a New York joint man
You can pick your teeth with a New York joint
Well Im the little red rooster
Too lazy to crow the day
Little red rooster
Too lazy to crow the day
Keep everything in the barnyard
Upset in every way
Dogs begin to bark
The hounds begin to howl
Dogs begin to bark and
The hounds begin to howl
Look out strange cat people
The roosters on the prowl
Yeah dogs begin to bark
The hounds begin to howl
Dogs begin to bark
The hounds begin to howl
Look out strange cat people
Yeah the roosters on the prowl
If you see my rooster

Aint been no peace in the barnyard
Since my little red rooster been goneI was doing time in the universal mind
I was feeling fine
I was turning keys I was setting people free
I was doing all right
Then you came along
With a suitcase and a song
Turned my head around
Now Im so alone
Just looking for a home
In every place I see
Im the freedom man

Thats how lucky I am
I was doing time in the universal mind
I was feeling fine
I was turning keys I was setting people free

Then you came along
With a suitcase and a song
Turned my head around
Now Im so alone
Just looking for a home
In every place I see

I liked to crawl back in my brain
I think you know the game I mean
I mean the game called Go insane
Now you should try this little game
Just close your eyes forget your name
Forget the world forget the people
And well erect a different steeple
This little game is fun to do
Just close your eyes no way to lose
And Im right here Im going too
Release control were breaking throughI went down to St James Infirmary
I saw my baby there
Stretched out on a marble table
So cold
So white
So paleDo you know the warm progress
under the stars
Do you know we exist
Have you forgotten the keys
to the kingdom
Have you been borne yet
are you alive
Lets reinvent the gods all teh myths
of the ages
Celebrate symbols from deep elder forests
Have you forgotten the lessons
of the ancient war
We need great golden copulations
The fathers are cackling in trees
of the forest
Our mother is dead in the sea
Do you know we are being led to
slaughters by placid admirals
that fat slow generals are getting
obscene on young blood
Do you know we are ruled by TV
The moon is dry blood beast
Guerrilla bands are rolling numbers
in the next block of green vine
amassing for warfare on innocent
herdsman who are just dying
O great creator of being
grant us one more hour to
perform our art
perfect our lives
The moths atheists are doubly divine
dying
We live we die
death not ends it
Journey we more into the
Nightmare
Cling to life
Our passiond flower
Cling to Cunts cocks
of despair
We got our final vision
by clap
Columbus groin got
filled wgreen death
I touched her thigh
death smiled
We have assembled inside this ancient
insane theatre
To propagate our lust for life
flee the swarming wisdom
of the streets
The barns are stormed
The windows kept
only one of all the rest
To dance save us
Wthe divine mockery
of words
Music inflames temperament
When the true Kings murderers
are allowed to roam free
a one thousand Magicians arise in the land
Where are the feasts
we are promised
Where is the wine
The New Wine
dying on the vine
resident mockery
give us an hour for magic
We of the purple glove
We of the starling flight
velvet hour
We of arabic pleasuress breed
We of sundome the night
Give us creed
To believe
A nightr of lust
Give us trust in
The Night
Give of color
hundred hues
a rich mandala
for me for you
for your silky
pillowed house
a head wisdom
a bed
Troubled decree
Resident mockery
has claimed thee
We used to believe
in the good old days
We still receive
In little ways
The things of Kindness
unsporting brow
Forget allow
Did you know freedom exists
in school books
Did you know madmen are
running our prisons
win a jail win a gaol
win a white free protestant
maelstrom
Were perched headlong
on the edge of boredom
Were reaching for death
on the end of a candle
Were trying for something
thats already found us
Wow Im sick of doubt
Live in the light of certain
south
Cruel bindings
The sevants have the power
dog-men their mean women
pulling poor blankets over
our sailors
Im sick of dour faces
Starong at me from the TV
Tower I want roses in
my garden bower dig
Royal babies rubies
must now replace aborted
Strangers in the mud
These mutants blood-meal
for the plant thats plowed
they are waiting to take us into
the severed garden
Do you know how pale wanton thrillful
comes death on a stranger hour
unannounced unplanned for
like a scaring over-friendly guest youve
brought to bed
Death makes angels of us all
gives us wings
where we had shoulders
smooth as ravens
claws
No more money no more fancy dress
This other kingdom seems by far the best
until its other jaw reveals incest
loose obedience to a vegetable law
I will not go
Prefer a feast of friends
To the Giant familyAdolf Hitler is still alive
I slept with her last night
Come out from behind
That false mustache Adolf
I know youre in thereFor seven years I dwelt in the loose palace of exile
Playing strange games with the girls of the island
Now I have come again to the land of the fair
And the strong and the wise
Brothers and sisters of the pale forest children of night
Who among you will run with the hunt
Now night arrives with her purple legion
Retire now to your tents and to your dreams
Tomorrow we enter the town of my birth
I want to be ready
The Doors The Doors
Were out of time
Thank you very much were out of timeWhat are they doing in the hyacinth house
What are they doing in the hyacinth house
To please the lions in this day
I need a brand new friend who doesnt bother me
I need a brand new friend who doesnt trouble me
I need someone and who doesnt need me
I see the bathroom is clear I think that somebodys near
Im sure that someone is following me oh yeah
Why did you throw the jack of hearts away
Why did you throw the jack of hearts away
It was the only card in the deck that I had left to playI went down to the crossroads fell down on my knees
Down to the crossroads fell down on my knees
I said Im beggin for mercy Incomprehensible if you please
I went down to the crossroads tried to beg a ride
Down to the crossroads tried to beg a ride
Nobody seemed to know me everybody passed me by

From the top of my hip
To my cowboy shoes
Whole lotta money
Nothing to lose
Ive got the poontang bluesI wanna tell you bout Texas Radio and the Big Beat
Comes out of the Virginia swamps
Cool and slow with plenty of precision
With a back beat narrow and hard to master
Some call it heavenly in its brilliance
Others mean and truthful of the Western dream
I love the friends I have gathered together on this thin raft
We have constructed pyramids in honor of our escaping
This is the land where the Pharaoh died
The Negroes in the forest brightly feathered
They are saying Forget the night
Live with us in forests of Azure
Out here on the perimeter there are no stars
Out here we is stoned immaculate
Listen to this and Ill tell you bout the heartache
Ill tell you bout the heartache and the loss of God
Ill tell you bout the hopeless night
The meager food for souls forgot
Ill tell you bout the maiden with raw iron soul
Ill tell you this
No eternal reward will forgive us now for wasting the dawn
Ill tell you bout Texas Radio and the Big Beat
Soft driving slow and mad like some new language
Now listen to this and Ill tell you bout the Texas
Ill tell you bout the Texas Radio
Ill tell you bout the hopeless night
Wandering the Western dream
Tell you bout the maiden with raw iron soulPeople are strange When youre a stranger
Faces look ugly When youre alone
Women seem wicked when youre unwanted
Streets are uneven when youre down
When youre strange faces come out in the rain

Wait a second hold on lets have a little help man
Come on everybody go back to their seats
People are gonna get hurt up here theyre gonna pass out
Now we dont want that man and The Doors dont want that either
Ladies and gentlemen The Doors
Now hold it weve gotta tune up
Hey Philadelphia
Do you feel all rightWow Im sick of doubt
Live in the light of certain
South
Cruel bindings
The servants have the power
dog-men and their mean women
pulling poor blankets over
our sailors
Im sick of dour faces
Staring at me from the TV
Tower I want roses in
my garden bower dig
Royal babies rubies
must now replace aborted
Strangers in the mud
These mutants blood-meal
for the plant thats plowed
They are waiting to take us into
the severed garden
Do you know how pale and wanton thrillful
comes death on a strange hour
unannounced unplanned for
like a scaring over-friendly guest youve
brought to bed
Death makes angels of us all
and gives us wings
where we had shoulders
smooth as ravens
claws
No more money no more fancy dress
This other kingdom seems by far the best
until its other jaw reveals incest
and loose obedience to a vegetable lawPeople get ready

There was a person there
Who put forth the proposition
That you can petition the Lord with prayer
Petition the Lord with prayer
Petition the Lord with prayer
You cannot petition the Lord with prayerInstrumentalWe came down the rivers and highways
We came down from forests and falls
We came down from Carson and Springfield
We came down from phoenix enthralled
And I can tell you the names of the Kingdom
I can tell you the things that you know
Listening for a fistful of silence
Climbing valleys into the shadeDead cats dead rats cant see what they were at alright
Dead cat in a top hat wow sucking on the young mans blood
Wishing he could come yeah sucking on the soldiers brain
Wishing it would be the same
Dead cat dead rat cant you see what they were at
Fat cat in a top hat thinks hes an aristocrat
Thinks he can kill and slaughter thinks he can shoot my daughter
Yeah right oh yeah oh right yeah
Dead cats dead rats think theyre an aristocrat
Crap now thats crapOnce I had a little game
I liked to crawl back in my brain
I think you know the game I mean
Well I mean the game called Go insane
Now you should try this little game
Just close your eyes forget your name
Forget the world forget the people
And well erect a different steeple
This little game is fun to do
Just close your eyes no way to lose
And Im right here Im going too
Release control were breaking throughShe was a princess Queen of the highway
Sign on the road said Take us to Madre
No one could save her save the blind tiger
He was a monster black dressed in leather
She was a princess Queen of the highway
Now they are wedded she is a good girl
Naked as children out in the meadow
Naked as children wild as can be
Soon to have offspring start it all over
Start at all over
American boy American girl
Most beautiful people in the world
Son of a frontier Indian swirl
Dancing through the midnight whirl-pool
Formless hope it can
Continue a little while longerDo you know the warm progress
under the stars
Do you know we exist
Have you forgotten the keys
to the kingdom
Have you been borne yet
are you alive
Lets reinvent the gods all teh myths
of the ages
Celebrate symbols from deep elder forests
Have you forgotten the lessons
of the ancient war
We need great golden copulations
The fathers are cackling in trees
of the forest
Our mother is dead in the sea
Do you know we are being led to
slaughters by placid admirals
that fat slow generals are getting
obscene on young blood
Do you know we are ruled by TV
The moon is dry blood beast
Guerrilla bands are rolling numbers
in the next block of green vine
amassing for warfare on innocent
herdsman who are just dying
O great creator of being
grant us one more hour to
perform our art
perfect our lives
The moths atheists are doubly divine
dying
We live we die
death not ends it
Journey we more into the
Nightmare
Cling to life
Our passiond flower
Cling to Cunts cocks
of despair
We got our final vision
by clap
Columbus groin got
filled wgreen death
I touched her thigh
death smiled
We have assembled inside this ancient
insane theatre
To propagate our lust for life
flee the swarming wisdom
of the streets
The barns are stormed
The windows kept
only one of all the rest
To dance save us
Wthe divine mockery
of words
Music inflames temperament
When the true Kings murderers
are allowed to roam free
a one thousand Magicians arise in the land
Where are the feasts
we are promised
Where is the wine
The New Wine
dying on the vine
resident mockery
give us an hour for magic
We of the purple glove
We of the starling flight
velvet hour
We of arabic pleasuress breed
We of sundome the night
Give us a creed
To believe
A nightr of lust
Give us trust in
The Night
Give of color
hundred hues
a rich mandala
for me for you
for your silky
pillowed house
a head wisdom
a bed
Troubled decree
Resident mockery
has claimed thee
We used to believe
in the good old days
We still receive
In little ways
The things of Kindness
unsporting brow
Forget allow
Did you know freedom exists
in school books
Did you know madmen are
running our prisons
win a jail win a gaol
win a white free protestant
maelstrom
Were perched headlong
on the edge of boredom
Were reaching for death
on the end of a candle
Were trying for something
thats already found us

Prefer a feast of friends
To the Giant familyWell you asked how much I love you
Why do ships with sails love the wind
And will I be thinking of you
Will I ever pass this way again
Ill be returning some day
Until then
Please dont ask me my direction
Let my tracks be buried in the sea
Cause to wander is my infection
Till the four winds bring you back to me
Dont count your memories
Think of me as just a dream
Just like this melody I sing
Well you asked how much I love you

Till the four winds bring you back to me

Just like this melody I singThe bird sings outside my piano
Lark of sweet love singing low
The more I play the more he sings
He lives right up there in the green tree
Singing to me melodies
And in return I play for him
I played him a song on my piano
Well I played real good I played what I could
And in return he sang for me
He lives right there in the tree
Giving me his melodies
A bird sings outside my piano
Well I played real good I played what I could
And in return he sang for me
He lives right there in the tree
Giving me his melodies
A bird sings outside my piano

From the album Other Voices
composer Robbie KriegerOne two three four billion souls are gonna rest
If all our friends dont try their best
To change the way this world is headed for
We can find our hapiness
It aint so hard to find
Just look a little further up the line
Just a little further up in time
Dont you see that we could be the first in history
Leavin all that we dont need behind
We could clean it up and make it shine
Hey
One two three four billion souls are gonna rest
If all our friends dont try their best
To change the way this world is headed for
We can find our hapiness
It aint so hard to find
Just look a little further up the line
Just a little further up in time
Dont you see that we could be the first in history
Leavin all that we dont need behind
We could clean it up and make it shineWell I heard a story you can judge its worth
About the sun and the moon
This time they came down to earth
They passed in the heavens each day up above
Time after time and it soon became love
They could not touch they could not kiss
They had no flesh no earthly bliss
So they made a scheme they made a plan
They would come down to earth as a woman and a man
She rode a lunar wave he flew a solar beam
They took on human forms to live out a dream
The most beautiful people that Ive ever seen
They were the Peking King and the New York Queen
I said the Peking King and the New York Queen
As fate would have it in the toss of the dice
They went to opposite ends of this world of our lives
Opposite eyes opposite minds
Such things matter in these troubled times
Peking in the East and New York in the West
Each place thought that it was the best
But the sun and the moon on their earthly quest
Knew without a doubt that it was all the best
They said what does it matter how you read a book
Its all the same no matter how it looks
Well the only thing important to the Peking King
Was bein in the arms of his New York Queen
Thousand of miles they were so far apart
How to get together Oh where to start
On the California Zephyr and the Shanghai Express
He headed to Hong Kong she headed out west
No passports no visas no government quotas
No secret missile sites in South Dakota
No red tape no red guard could stop the dream
Of the Peking King and the New York Queen
I said the Peking King and the New York Queen
Well they found a little island in the Phillipines
It was a perfect little place to live out a dream
They say East is East West is West
They say the twain wont meet but dont you take that bet
Cause youre invited to a wedding and to share the dream
Of the Peking King and the New York Queen
The Peking King and the New York Queen
Cause youre invited to a wedding and to share the dream
Cause youre invited to a wedding and to share the dream
Of the Peking King and the New York Queen
The Peking King and the New York Queen
Youre invited to the wedding of the sun and the moonWell I heard the news theres good rockin tonight

We all feel prouder than a king
Cause everyone everyone loves that number

The cattle are prowlin and the coyotes are howlin
Way out where the dogies bawl
Where spurs are a-jinglin a cowboy is singin
This lonesome cattle call
Woo-hoo woo-hoo hoo hoo
Woo-hoo woo-hoo hoo hoo
Woo-hoo woo-hoo hoo hoo hoo
Woo-hoo woo-hoo hoo
He rides in the sun till his days work is done
And he rounds up the cattle each fall
Woo-hoo woo-hoo hoo hoo
Singin his cattle call
For hours he will ride on the range far and wide
When the night wind blows up a squall
His heart is a feather in all kinds of weather
He sings his cattle call
Woo-hoo woo-hoo hoo hoo
Woo-hoo woo-hoo hoo hoo
Woo-hoo woo-hoo hoo hoo hoo
Woo-hoo woo-hoo hoo
Hes brown as a berry from ridin the prairie
And sings with an ol western drawl
Woo-hoo woo-hoo hoo hoo
Singin his cattle callHey little girl you sure are cute to me

Get ready honey lets go just-a one more timeWhen I was a child ladies and gentlemen I was a dreamer
I read comic books and I was the hero of the comic book I saw movies and I
was the hero in the movieSo every dream I ever dreamed has come true a hundred
times These gentlemen over there these are the type who care are dedicated
You realize if its not possible that they might be building the kingdom
its not far-fetched from reality Id like to say that I learned
very early in life that
Without a song the day would never end
Without a song a man aint got a friend
Without a song the road would never bend
Without a song
So I keep singing a song
Good night
Thank youDo you or dont you love me
Such an easy question
Why cant I get an answer
Tell me will you or wont you need me
Such an easy question
Why cant I get an answer
All you do is give a sigh
And beat around the bush
Can it be that youre too shy
To give yourself a little old push
Can you or cant you tell me yes
Its such an easy question
Why cant I get an answerIts a long lonely highway when youre travellin all alone
And its a mean old world when you got no one to call your own
And you pass through towns too small to even have a name oh yes
But you gotta keep on goin on that road to nowhere
Gotta keep on goin though theres no one to care
Just keep movin down the line
Its a long lonely highway without her by my side
And its a trail full of teardrops that keep on being cried
My hearts so heavy its a low down dirty shame oh yes
You gotta keep on goin on that road to nowhere
Gotta keep on goin though theres no one to care
Just keep movin down the line
I gotta rock for my pillow neath a weeping willow
And the cool grass for my bed
My drinking waters muddy so dont you tell me buddy
That I wouldnt be better off dead
Its a long lonely highway gettin longer all the time
And if she dont come and get me
Well Im gonna lose my mind
So if you read about me tell her shes the one to blame oh yes
You gotta keep on goin on that road to nowhere
Gotta keep on goin though theres no one to care
Just keep movin down the lineCOLD COLD HEAR
Elvis Presley Willie Nelson three hundred and five
Written by Hank Williams

I tried so hard my dear to show that youre my every dream
Yet youre afraid each thing I do is just some evil scheme
Now a memory from your lonesome past keeps us so far apart
Why cant I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold cold heart

Another love before my time made your heart sad and blue
And so my heart is paying now for things I didnt do
In anger unkind words are said they make the teardrops start
Why cant I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold cold heart


Yeah there was a time when I believed that you belonged to me
But now I know your heart is shackled to a memory

The more I learn to care for you the more we drift apart
Why cant I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold cold heart
Why cant I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold cold heartNow blue aint the word for the way that I feel
That old storm brewing in this heart of mine
Someday crazy arms will hold somebody new
But now Im so lonely all the time
Crazy arms that needs to hold somebody new
While your heart keeps sayin your not mine not mine
Not mine not mine my troubled minds grows blue
To another youll be wed but now Im so lonely all the time
Now take all those precious dreams I had for you dear
And take all that love I thought was mine
Some day your crazy arms will hold somebody new
But now I m so lonely all the time
Crazy arms that reach to hold somebody new
While my yearning heart keeps saying your not mine
Not mine not mine not mine my troubled mind goes blue
To another youll be wed but now Im so lonely all the timeThis thing called love I just cant handle it
This thing called love I must get round to it
I aint ready
Crazy little thing called love
This thing called love
It cries in a cradle all night
It swings it jives
It shakes all over like a jellyfish
I kinda like it
Crazy little thing called love
There goes my baby
She knows how to rock and roll
She drives me crazy
She gives me hot and cold fever
Then she leaves me in a cool cool sweat
I gotta be cool relax
Get hip get on my tracks
Take a back seat hitch-hike
And take a long ride on my motor bike
Until Im ready
Crazy little thing called love
I gotta be cool relax
Get hip and get on my tracks
Take a back seat hitch-hike
And take a long ride on my motor bike
Until Im ready
Crazy little thing called love
This thing called love I just cant handle it
This thing called love I must get round to it
I aint ready

This was gonna be the night tonight
I was gonna get to hold you tight
But I guess we didnt plan it right
I never stood a chance we couldnt dance
Cause theres no room to rhumba in a sports car
You cant move forward or back
Theres no room to do what the beat tells you to
Without throwing your spine outta wack
When a little kiss I want to steal
I hit my head against the steering wheel
Now I know the way a pretzel feels
All I can do is shoutHey let me out
Cause theres no room to rhumba in a sports car
You cant move forward or back
Theres no room to do what the beat tells you to
Without throwing your spine outta wack
What a way to waste a day with you
Nothing happens that can tell the truth
Lets go out and find a telephone booth
Yeah thats a better place I like more space
Cause theres no room to rhumba in a sports car
You cant move forward or back
Theres no room to do what the beat tells you to
Without throwing your spine outta wackWords music by Preston Foster Elvis Presley

ha ha ha ha haI HEARD THE BELLS ON CHRISTMAS
Elvis Presley
Written by
I heard the bells on Christmas day
Their old familiar carols play
And wild and sweet the words repeat
Of peace on earth good will to men
I thought how as the day had come
The belfries of all Christendom
Had rolled along the unbroken song
Of peace on earth good will to men
And in despair I bowed my head
There is no peace on earth I said
For hate is strong and mocks the song
Of peace on earth good will to men
Then pealed the bells more loud and deep
God is not dead nor doth he sleep
The wrong shall fail the right prevail
With peace on earth good will to men
With peace on earth good will to men
Merry ChristmasThats what you get for loving me
Thats what you get for loving me
Everything we had is gone you can see
Thats what you get for loving me
Now dont you shed a tear for me
I aint the love you thought Id be
Ive had a hundred just like you
But dont be blue Ill have a thousand before Im through

With a dollar in my hand
And an aching in my heart
And my -pockets full of sand
Im a long ways from home
And I missed my loved one so
In the early mornin rain
With no place to go
Out on runway number nine
Big seven hundred and seven set to go
Well Im out here on the grass
Where the pavement never grows
Where the liquor tasted good
And the women all were fast
There she goes my friend
Shes rolling out at last
Hear the mighty engines roar
See the silver wing on high
Shes away and westward bound
For above the clouds she flies
Where the mornin rain dont fall
And the sun always shines
Shell be flying over my home
In about three hours time
This ol airports got me down
Its no earthly good to me
Cause Im stuck here on the ground
Cold and drunk as I might be
Cant jump a jet plane
Like you can a freight train
So I best be on my way
In the early mornin rain
So I best be on my way
In the early mornin rain
So I best be on my way
In the early mornin rainWise men say only fools rush in
But I cant help falling in love with you
Shall I stay
Would it be a sin
If I cant help falling in love with you
Like a river flows surely to the sea
Darling so it goes
Some things are meant to be
Take my hand take my whole life too
For I cant help falling in love with you
Like a river flows surely to the sea
Darling so it goes
Some things are meant to be
Take my hand take my whole life too
For I cant help falling in love with you
For I cant help falling in love with youNight and you
And blue Hawaii
The night is heavenly
And you are heaven to me
Lovely you
And blue Hawaii
With all this loveliness
There should be love
Come with me
While the moon is on the sea
The night is young
And so are we so are we
Dreams come true
In blue Hawaii
And mine could all come true
This magic night of nights with youThis is the moment
Ive waited for
I can hear my heart singing
Soon bells will be ringing
This is the moment
Of sweet Aloha

Old times they are not forgotten
Look away look away look away Dixieland
Oh I wish I was in Dixie away away
In Dixieland I take my stand to live and die in Dixie
For Dixieland I was born
Early Lord one frosty morn
Look away look away look away Dixieland
Glory glory hallelujah
Glory glory hallelujah
Glory glory hallelujah
His truth is marching on
So hush little baby
Dont you cry
You know your daddys bound to die
But all my trials Lord soon be overI cant stop loving you
So Ive made up my mind
To live in memory
Of such an old lonesome time
I cant stop wanting you
Its useless to say
So Ill just live my life
In dreams of yesterday
Those happy hours
That we once knew
Though long ago
They still make me blue
They say that time
Heals a broken heart
But time has stood still
Since weve been apartHear that lonesome winter bird
He sounds too blue to fly
The midnight train is whining low
Im so lonesome I could cry
Did you ever see a robin weep
When leaves began to die
That means hes lost the will to live
Im so lonesome I could cry
The silence of a falling star
Lights up a purple sky
And as I wonder where you are
Im so lonesome I could cry
Im so lonesome I could cryNever know how much I love you
Never know how much I care
When you put your arms around me
I get a fever thats so hard to bear
You give me fever when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning
Fever all through the night
Sun lights up the daytime
Moon lights up the night
I light up when you call my name
And you know Im gonna treat you right
You give me fever when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning
Fever all through the night
Everybodys got the fever
That is something you all know
Fever isnt such a new thing
Fever started long ago
Romeo loved Juliet
Juliet she felt the same
When he put his arms around her
He said Julie baby youre my flame
Thou give us fever when we kisseth
Fever with thy flaming youth
Fever Im on fire
Fever yea I burn for sooth
Captain Smith and Pocahontas
Had a very mad affair
When her daddy tried to kill him
She said daddy o dont you dare
He gives me fever with his kisses
Fever when he holds me tight
Fever Im his misses
Oh daddy wont you treat him right
Now youve listened to my story
Heres the point that I have made
Cats were born to give chicks fever
Be it Fahrenheit or Centigrade
They give you fever when they kiss you
Fever if you live and learn
Fever till you sizzle
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burnWhether youre riding down a highway
Or walkin down a street
It makes no difference baby
Im gonna love you just as mean
Cause holdin your little hand
Makes me feel so very nice
Anyplace is paradise
When Im with you
Whether were standin on a doorstep
Or sittin at a park
Or strollin down shady lane
Or dancin in the dark
Well I can take you in my arms
And look into your pretty eyes
Anyplace is paradise
When Im with you
Give me a cave up in the mountain
Or a shack down by the sea
And I will be in heaven honey
If you are there with me
Well kiss your pretty lips
See the love-light in your eyes
Anyplace is paradise
When Im with you
Baby Id live deep in the jungle
And sleep up in a tree
And let the rest of the world go be
If you were there with me
Well I could love you all the time
Baby a jungle would be fine
Anyplace is paradise
When Im with youI said Id hold I said Id hold
I said Id hold you in my heart till I can hold you in my arms
Like youve never been held before
Well Ill think of you each day and then Ill dream the night away
Oh till you are in my arms once more

Oh darling please wait for meI memorized the note you sent
Go to all the places that we went
I seem to search the whole day through
For anything thats part of you
I kept a ribbon from your hair
A breath of perfume lingers there
It helps to cheer me when Im blue
Anything thats part of you
Oh how it hurts to miss you so
When I know you dont love me anymore
To go on needing you
Knowing you dont need me
No reason left for me to live
What can I take what can I give
When Id give all of someone new
For anything thats part of youIll have a blue Christmas without you
Ill be so blue just thinking about you
Decorations of red on a green Christmas tree
Wont be the same dear if youre not here with me
And when those blue snowflakes start falling
Thats when those blue memories start calling

How lonely life has been
But life began again
The day you took my hand
And yes I know how lonely life can be
The shadows follow me
And the night wont set me free
But I dont let the evening get me down
Now that youre around me
And you love me too
Your thoughts are just for me
You set my spirit free
And Im happy that you do
The book of life is brief
And once a page is read
All but love is dead
That is my belief
And yes I know how loveless life can be
The shadows follow me
And the night wont set me free
But I dont let the evening bring me down
Now that youre around me
And I love you so

Doin the best

But its not good enough for you
You know I was the kind whod run
Any time youd call

But its not good enough for you
But its not good enough for youI can explain about last night
Though things didnt look just right
Please believe me there was nothing wrong
I thought about you baby all night long
Cross my heart I hope to die
Well I wouldnt tell you no lie mmm
Talk about a piece of rotten luck
You do a friend a favor and you wind up stuck
She couldnt hold a candle to you no siree
Very hard to handle like a Model T
Cross my heart I hope to die
Well I wouldnt tell you no lie
Please believe me when I say
Wild horses couldnt drag me away
From you cause I dont have to look too hard
To see what Ive got in my own back yard
So please forgive me and forget
Dont say my alloys all wet
I miss those kisses from your honeycomb
This humble bumble bee just wants to fly back home
Cross my heart I hope to die
Well I wouldnt tell you no lie
I wouldnt tell you no lie
No no no no no no
I wouldnt tell you no lieWell I quit my job down at the car wash
Left my mama a goodbye note
By sundown Id left Kingston
With my guitar under my coat
I hitchhiked all the way down to Memphis
Got a room at the YMCA
For the next three weeks I went huntin them nights
Just lookin for a place to play
Well I thought my pickin would set em on fire
But nobody wanted to hire a guitar man
Well I nearly bout starved to death down in Memphis
I run outta money and luck
So I bought me a ride down to Macon Georgia
On a overloaded poultry truck
I thumbed on down to Panama City
Started pickin out some o them all night bars
Hopin I could make myself a dollar
Makin music on my guitar
I got the same old story at them all night piers
There aint no room around here for a guitar man
We dont need a guitar man son
So I slept in the hobo jungles
Roamed a thousand miles of track
Till I found myself in Mobile Alabama
At a club they call Big Jacks
A little four-piece band was jammin
So I took my guitar and I sat in
I showed em what a band would sound like
With a swingin little guitar man
Show em son
If you ever take a trip down to the ocean
Find yourself down around Mobile
Make it on out to a club called Jacks
If you got a little time to kill
Just follow that crowd of people
Youll wind up out on his dance floor
Diggin the finest little five piece group
Up and down the Gulf of Mexico
Guess whos leadin that five-piece band
Well wouldnt ya know its that swingin little guitar manGirls on the beaches commit a sin
They dont show yards and yards of skin

Set in your old ways
Changes are a-comin
For these are changing days
And if your head is in the sand
While things are goin on
What you need what you need
What you need is a change of habit
Now if youre in the habit
To let your temper fly
When you talk with people
Who dont see eye to eye
And if you dont believe it
Theres a newer world ahead
What you need what you need
What you need is a change of habit
A change of habit a change of outlook
A change of heart youll be all right
The halls of darkness
Have doors that open
Its never too late
To see the light
So if youre in the habit
Of putting people down
Just because theyre different
From the wrong side of town
Well dont count on any medals son
Theyre pinning none on you
What you need what you need
What you need is a change of habitEarth boy dream of angel

Acting like he wrote the golden rules
Shaking his fist and speeching at me
Shouting from his soap box like a fool
Come Sunday morning hes lying in bed
With his eye all red with the wine in his head
Wishing he was dead when he oughta be
Heading for Sunday school
Clean up your own backyard
Oh dont you hand me none of your lines
Clean up your own backyard
You tend to your business Ill tend to mine
Drugstore cowboy criticizing
Acting like hes better than you and me
Standing on the sidewalk supervising
Telling everybody how they ought to be
Come closing time most every night
He locks up tight and out go the lights
And he ducks out of sight and he cheats on his wife
With his employee
Clean up your own backyard
Oh dont you hand me none of your lines
Clean up your own backyard
You tend to your business Ill tend to mine
Armchair quarterbacks always moanin
Second guessing people all day long
Pushing fooling and hanging on in
Always messing where they dont belong
When you get right down to the nitty-gritty
Isnt it a pity that in this big city
Not a one alittle bitty manll admit
He could have been a little bit wrong
Clean up your own backyard
Oh dont you hand me dont you hand me none of your lines
Clean up your own backyard
You tend to your business Ill tend to mine
Clean up your own backyard
You tend to your business Ill tend to mineDid you ever notice when the sun goes down
Out of nowhere comes a strange and pretty sound
Its a whistling tune for walking in the night
If you listen you can hear it in the breeze
Specially when the breeze is drifting through the trees
Its a whistling tune for walking in the night
And the murmuring waters sing the song
The echoing mountains hum along
The whispering valleys fill the air
With a whistling tune our hearts can share
Its so wonderful to walk beneath the moon
Listening to old mother natures favorite tune
Its a whistling tune for walking in the nightWell a hundred years from now I wont be crying
A hundred years from now I wont be blue
My heart will have to forget that we ever met
But I wont care a hundred years from now
Ill never forget sweetheart the night you told me
That you could Live without my love somehow
Thats all in the past I knew it wouldnt last
But I wont care a hundred years from nowAsk me if I wanted to caress you
And Id confess
Ask me if Im longing to possess you
Ill answer yes
Now that were together
I could hold you close forever
And I swear that I would never let you go
Theres no question that I care more than you
Love me darling just be mine completely
And theres nothing I wont do if you
Just ask meWhen everyone thought the world was flat
Columbus said Its round
He went down in history
And America was found
Cause
He had confidence
A little thing called confidence
Theres no job too immense when youve got
Confidence
With a see and an O and an N and an F
And an I and a D and an ENCE
Put em all together and what have you got
Confidence
Youll be surprised what you can do
If you will only try
Remember the tortoise and the hare
Who had that famous race
The speedy hare wound up nowhere
And slow poke took first place
Cause
He had confidence
A little thing called confidence
Theres no job too immense when youve got
Confidence
Youll be surprised what you can do
If you will only try
How do you know that you cant ride a rainbow in the sky
Youll be surprised what you can do
If you will only try
All you need is confidence
A little thing called confidence
Theres no job too immense when youve got
Confidence
With a see and an O and an N and an F
And an I and a D and an ENCE
Put em all together and what have you got
ConfidenceCould I fall in love for the very first time
Thats what I ask myself when youre lips touch mine
Could I fall in love on a night like tonight
Thats what Id like to know when I hold you tight
Now that were alone Now that were alone
Just a kiss apart Just a kiss apart
I have the answer from the feeling in my heart
Could I fall in love and forever be true
My heart tells me I could if I fell for youIn the twilight glow i see her
Blue eyes crying in the rain
When we kissed goodbye and parted
I knew wed never meet again
Love is like a dying ember
Only memories remain
Through the ages i remember
Blue eyes crying in the rain
Someday when we meet up yonder
Well stroll hand in hand again
In a land that knows no parting
Blue eyes crying in the rain
Blue eyes crying in the rain
Blue eyes crying in the rain
Blue eyes crying in the rainThough you are gone I still wear your ring
Theyre playing the song we used to sing
Echoes of love echoes of love
Are coming to me out of the past
The letters you wrote I treasure them so
And I hear your voice wherever I go
Echoes of love echoes of love
Are coming to me out of the past
In the rustle of a breeze in the patter of the rain
In the rushing of the seas all I hear is your name
Come back my love and once you are near
Darling I know no more will I hear
Echoes of love echoes of love
cause youll be with me right in my heart
Echoes of love echoes of love
Cause youll be with me right in my heartAny day now I will hear you say
Goodbye my love
Youll be on your way
Then my wild beautiful bird
You will have flown
Any day now Ill be all alone
Oh oh oh
Any day now when your restless eyes
Meet someone new
To my sad surprise
Then the blue shadow will fall all over town
Any day now
Love will let me down
Oh oh oh
I know I shouldnt want to keep you
If you dont want to stay yeah
Until youve gone forever
Ill be holding on for dear life
Holding you this way
Begging you to stay
Any day now
When the clock strikes go
Youll call it off
Then my tears will flow
Then the blue shadow will fall all over town
Any day now
Love will let me down
Oh oh oh
Oh any day now
Oh oh oh
Oh any day now

Dark shadows follow me
Heres where lifes dream lies disillusioned
The edge of reality
Oh I can hear strange voices echo
Laughing with mockery
The border line of doom Im facing
The edge of reality
On the edge of reality she sits there tormenting me
The girl with the nameless face
On the edge of reality where she overpowers me
With fears that I cant explain
She drove me to the point of madness
The brink of misery
If shes not real then Im condemned to
The edge of reality
On the edge of reality she sits there tormenting me
The girl with the nameless face
On the edge of reality where she overpowers me
With fears that I cant explain
She drove me to the point of madness
The brink of misery
If shes not real then Im condemned to
The edge of realityWith eyes that hide the man within
You see behind the eyes of other men
Youve lived and died and come to life again
And now you standin alone at the crossroads of your mind
Youve left your yesterdays behind
But which road leads you to tomorrow
Charro
Youve turned your back on yesterday
Betrayed a man who swore hed make you pay
For when you left you took his pride away
You know hell never let you break away so easily
Youll have to fight before youre free
But how much more time can you borrow
Charro
Now in a single moment your past grows dim
One thought goes racing across your mind
You ride to meet the woman you stole from him
Oh no Charro dont go
Charro dont go
Theres something hanging in the wind
Your past is catching up and closing in
Youve been halfway to hell and back again
And now you laugh in the devils face with your last breath
Youll run a race with life and death
But will you live to see tomorrow
CharroOn the hills of Georgia
Across the plains of Tennessee
Ive seen and Ive done most everything
That a man can do or see
But if I could only borrow one dream from yesterday
Id be on that train tomorrow
Ill be home on Christmas day
And so many times before
She left that candle burning
Oh too many tears have fell
My soul filled with yearning
If I had any sense at all
Id just be on my way
Id be on that train tomorrow
Be home on Christmas day
Every time I think about her
All the love I left behind
Memories still linger in my troubled mind
I could set aside my pride
And Id be on my way
Id catch that train tomorrow
And be home on Christmas day
If I had any sense at all
Id just be on my way
Id catch that train tomorrow
Id be home on Christmas day
I said Id catch that train tomorrow
Id be home on Christmas dayHow can you lose what you never had
I tell myself when Im feeling sad
You dont have the right to cry
You believed your own lie
Its your fault because
You thought that she was yours
Think it over once think it over twice
I wish I could take my own advice
I know I should be glad why does it hurt so bad
How can you lose what you never had
You dont have the right to cry
You believed your own lie
Its your fault because
You thought that she was yours
Think it over once think it over twice
I wish I could take my own advice
I know I should be glad why does it hurt so bad
How can you lose what you never had
How can you lose what you never hadIm beginning to forget you
That old heartache is gone
Im beginning to sleep at night
No more crying till dawn
I can hear your name mentioned
And it brings no misery
Im beginnin to forget you
Like you forgot me
Im beginning to smile again
After crying for so long
I can hear the tune we loved so well
And its just another song
Im so happy that its over
Im so thankful to be free
Im beginnin to forget you
Like you forgot meIf I can never see you if I can never hold you
If I can never touch your face or feel your warm embrace
I still remember talkin I still remember laughin
I still remember lovin a lot yes touchin you babe Ive not forgot
And everythings bringin it back youre only just bringin it back
A familiar place for a familiar face just brings it all back
And everythings bringin it back good songs bringin it back
Even after so much time you know everythings bringin it back
Thinkin in my solitude wonderin about your attitude
Thinkin maybe that your love has died there it is I can see it in your eyes
And a look of sweet surrender but a touch of too much sadness
Cause Ive hurt you so you know your sorrow shows
And you just cant stay oh but you cant let go
Cause everythings bringin it back youre only just bringin it back
A familiar place for a familiar face just brings it all back
And everythings bringin it back good songs bringin it back
And even after so much time you know everythings bringin it backOh yes I know its true
The more you fall in love
The more your heart can break in two
Now that youve said goodbye
For every tender kiss
Ive had the tears I cry
I gave my heart and soul
All the love I knew
Oh how much it hurts me now
To know that we are through
Ill always feel this way
My arms will be so empty
Youll return some day and say
Your love yes your big love
Will be here to stay

Flying across the desert in a twa
I saw a woman walking across the sand
She been a walkin thirty miles en route to Bombay
To get a brown eyed handsome man
Her destination was a brown eyed handsome man

Back every since the world began
Theres been a whole lot of good women shed a tear
For a brown eyed handsome man
Thats what the trouble was brown eyed handsome man
Beautiful daughter couldnt make up her mind
Between a doctor and a lawyer man
Her mother told her daughter go out and find yourself
A brown eyed handsome man
Thats what your daddy is a brown eyed handsome man
Milo venus was a beautiful lass
She had the world in the palm of her hand
But she lost both her arms in a wrestling match
To get brown eyed handsome man
She fought and won herself a brown eyed handsome man
Two three count with nobody on
He hit a high fly into the stand
Rounding third he was headed for home
It was a brown eyed handsome man
That won the game it was a brown eyed handsome manFor the millionth and the last time

One more kiss and then I promise

Walking barefoot by the stream
Come on to me Your hairs softly falling
On my face as in a dream
And the time will be our time
And the grass wont pay no mind
Saying nothing lying where the sun is
Baking down upon our sides
My lips touch you with their soft wet kisses
Your hands gentle in reply
And the time will be our time
And the grass wont pay no mind
Child touch my soul with your cries
And the music will know what weve found
I hear a hundred good-byes
But today I hear only one sound
The moment were living is now
Now now now now now now now
Young bird flying and a soft wind blowing
Cools the sweat inside my palms
Close my eyes hear the flowers growing
As you lay sleeping in my arms
And the time will be our time
And the grass wont pay no mind
No the grass wont pay no mindI dont want to I dont want to
I dont want to let you know how much I want you
Dont come near me I dont trust you
I dont trust the way you thrill me when I touch you
I was happy free and easy I could go around
And do the things that please me
I dont want to get tied down with a girl like you
I dont want to love you but I do
I was happy free and easy I could go around
And do the things that please me
I dont want to get tied down with a girl like you
I dont want to love you but I do

Wont you play for me a down home country song
Cause when I kick my shoes off and I kick my blues off
With a barefoot ballad you just cant go wrong
Give me a honk-tonk fiddle with a guitar in the middle and a melody
Humming like a fountain swinging out on Smokey mountain
I want a barefoot ballad yes a barefoot ballad
Wont you play for me a down home country song
Cause when I kick my shoes off and I kick my blues off
With a barefoot ballad you just cant go wrong
Now the big toes connected to the two toe
And the two toes connected to the three toe
And the three toes connected to the four toe
And the four toes connected to the five toe
And the five toe and away we go

Wont you play for me a barefoot ballad songIn the early mornin rain
With a dollar in my hand
And an aching in my heart
And my pockets full of sand
Im a long ways from home
And I missed my loved one so
In the early mornin rain
With no place to go
Out on runway number nine
Big seven hundred and seven set to go
Well Im out here on the grass
Where the pavement never grows
Where the liquor tasted good
And the women all were fast
There she goes my friend
Shes rolling out at last
Hear the mighty engines roar
Hear the mighty engines roar
See the silver wing on high
See the silver wing on high
Shes away and westward bound
For above the clouds she flies
Where the mornin rain dont fall
And the sun always shines
Shell be flying over my home
In about three hours time
This ol airports got me down
Its no earthly good to me
Cause Im stuck here on the ground
Cold and drunk as I might be
Cant jump a jet plane
Cant jump a plane
Like you can a freight train
Like a freight train
So I best be on my way
In the early mornin rain
So I best be on my way
In the early mornin rain
So I best be on my way
In the early mornin rainI saw the harbor lights
They only told me we were parting
Those same old harbor lights
That once brought you to me
I watched the harbor lights
How could I help it
Tears were starting
Good-bye to golden nights
Beside the silvery seas
I long to hold you dear
And kiss you just once more
But you were on the ship
And I was on the shore
Now I know lonely nights
For all the while my heart keeps praying
That someday harbor lights
Will bring you back to meFame and fortune
How empty they can be
But when I hold you in my arms
Thats heaven to me
Who cares for fame and fortune
Theyre only passing things
But the touch of your lips on mine
Makes me feel like a king
Your kind of love
Is a treasure I hold
Its so much greater
Than silver or gold
I know that I have nothing
If you should go away
But to know that you love me
Brings fame and fortune my wayIll take you home again kathleen thomas p westendorf

And tears bedim your lovely eyes

Across the ocean wild
And when the fields are soft and green
I will take you to your home kathleen

That someday well meet again

Its been so long darling

I know just what Id like to be
A pampered pet of a rich brunette
Sitting on my mamas knee
Someone to love me
Someone to care
Rubberduck dubble little fingers through my hair
I need a dogs life
What a life thats good enough for me
Thats good enough for me
If I had a bone to be picking
A picking chicken or a steak
Curled up there in an easy chair
Man that wont be hard to take

Thats what Id be
Never bite a hand that feeds me no siree
Just lead a dogs life
What a life
Thats good enough for me
Thats good enough for me
Id find me a pink little poodle
And lose my noodle over her
I chase her round all over town
Just to ruffle up her fur
Nuzzle her muzzle
A hole in her paw
Greatest case of puppy lovin you ever saw
Its called a dogs life
What a life
Thats good enough for me
You heard me say it now

I hear Christmas bells
The gentle snow keeps falling down on people
Who are homeward bound
Thats the its always been
The circle never really ends
Christmas seems to come and go
Homes a the place that I dont know
Holly leaves and Christmas trees
Its that time of year
Lights aglow and mistletoe
Dont mean a thing when youre not here
As I walk walk this lonely street
The sound of snow beneath my feet
Ill think of how of how it used to be
Holly leaves and Christmas trees
Use to mean so much to meNow that the truth is hard to face
I cant forget you once were mine
Someone else is in my place
Whenever we meet my heart beats out of time
Just a little bit of green
Clouds my eyes to what Ive seen
Just a little bit of green
When I see you with someone new
And knowing that theres nothing I can do
Please dont try to tie me down
Those are the words you often say
I cant help seeing you around
You smile with surprise I turn my eyes away
Just a little bit of green
Oh-oh-ho clouds my eyes to what Ive seen
Just a little bit of green
When I see you with someone new
And knowing that theres nothing I can do
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Just a little bit of green
Oh-oh-ho clouds my eyes to what Ive seen
Just a little bit of green
When I see you with someone new
And knowing that theres nothing I can do
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Just a little bit of greenEasy come easy go

When your roosters a crowing at the break of dawn
Look out your window and Ill be gone
Youre the reason why Im traveling on
But dont think twice its all right
An it aint no use in turning on your light baby
The light I never knowed
An it aint no use in turning on your light baby
Im on the dark side of the road
But I wish there was something I could do or say
To try and make you change your mind and stay
We never did too much talking anyway
But dont think twice its all right
Well it aint no use in calling out my name gal
Like you never done before
It aint no use in calling out my name gal
I cant hear you anymore

But dont think twice its all right
So long honey baby
Where Im bound I cannot tell
But goodbyes too good a word gal
So Ill just kinda say Fare thee well

You could have done a lot better but I dont mind
You just kinda wasted my precious time
But dont think twice its all rightHere comes Santa Claus here comes Santa Claus

Hang your stockings and say a prayer
Cause Santa Claus comes tonight

For boys and girls again

Jump in bed and cover up your head
Because Santa Claus comes tonight

Smiles and says Aloha to his sweetheart Hawaii
The drowsy islands slumber one by one
Close their sleepy eyelids say goodnight to the sun
Then Hawaii like millions of times before
Blossoms in her lovers arms once more
Too soon the sunrise will wake her from her sleep
So until tomorrow sleep Hawaii sleepIll be home for Christmas
You can plan on me
Please have snow and mistletoe
And presents for the tree
Christmas Eve will find me
Where the love light leads
Ill be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams
Ill be home for ChristmasEvery man has a black star
A black star over his shoulder
And when a man sees his black star
He knows his time his time has come
Black star dont shine on me black star
Black star keep behind me black star
Theres a lot of livin I gotta do

Black star keep behind me black star
Theres a lot of livin I gotta do
Give me time to make a few dreams come true
Black starWe almost shared a dream
We almost made it as a team
How nice it would have been
We almost touched the stars
And there stood heaven almost ours
We were just outsiders looking in
We had the chance to fall
But fate stepped in to end it all
Before it could begin
And if its true youre really going
Theres nothing but goodbye to say
The saddest part of all is knowing
We almost went all the wayI am yours and you are mine come what may
Love like ours remains divine come what may
Even though were miles apart
Youre living in my lonely heart
At night the teardrops start and pour the long long day
I keep your picture near me since you went away
I plant a kiss upon your lips each night and day
Bear in mind and you will find a heart that is true
And Ill be here with you come what may
All right
I keep your picture near me since you went away
I plant a kiss upon your lips each night and day
Bear in mind and you will find a heart that is true
And Ill be here with you come what may
And Ill be here with you come what may
And Ill be here with you come what may
Ah um bop a bop a um bop a bop a come what mayDont ever take tour eyes off me
Not even for a minute
Cause like a panther I might pounce
And that will be the limit
I can be sneaky fast as a snake
I strike like a cobra make no mistake
And baby youll be trapped quick as a wink
Its animal instinct
Dont think that I wont pin you down
No matter how you plead it
Im like a lion whos been caged
And you are gonna meet it
Watch out Ill warn ya sharp as a hawk
Im wild as a tiger I prowl and I stalk
cause when a man feels thirst he takes a drink
Its animal instinctThere were five sleepyheads
All tucked into their beds
While I sang a lullaby
One got dream dust in her eye
There were four sleepyheads
Playing possum with me
Mr Sandman came by
And then there were three
Moonbeams play peek-a-boo
Three away became two
And my song was almost done
When the land of Nod took one
Kissed the last one goodnight
Then I heard not a peep
There were five sleepyheads
Now theyre all fast asleepThats what you get for loving me
Thats what you get for loving me
Everything we had is gone you can see
Thats what you get for loving me
Now dont you shed a tear for me
I aint the love you thought Id be
Ive had a hundred just like you
But dont be blue Ill have a thousand before Im through
Thats what you get for loving me
Thats what you get for loving me
Everything we had is gone you can see
Thats what you get for loving me
Now there you go youre cryin again
You should have known how things would end
But then some day when your poor heart is on the mend
I just might pass this way againI was the one who taught her to kiss
The way that she kisses you now
And you know the way she touches your cheek
Well I taught her how
I was the one who taught her to cry
When she wants you under her spell
The sight of her tears drives you out of your mind
I taught her so well
And then one day
I had my love as perfect as could be
She lived she loved she laughed she cried
And it was all for me
Ill never know who taught her to lie
Now that its over and done
Who learned the lesson when she broke my heart
I was the one
And then one day
I had my love as perfect as could be
She lived she loved she laughed she cried
And it was all for me
Ill never know who taught her to lie
Now that its over and done
Who learned the lesson when she broke my heart
I was the oneNo-ones in a hurry
No-one seems to worry
Why theyre all so happy is very clear
Every day siesta every night fiesta
I think Im gonna like it here
All this lovely scenery
Theres more to it than greenery
I know a chance for romance is always near
Mission bells are ringing everybodys singing
I think Im gonna like it hear
The sound of laughter from every doorway
Sweet music floating across the square
It seems to say things are going better
Your troubles like bubbles will soon disappear in the air
Down to my last peso but Im not afraid to say so
I feel just like a brave Spanish cavalier
I dont care where we go so lead on mi amigo
I think Im gonna like it hereOne thought of you
My heart begins churning
I feel return
To a fountain of love
My lips and eyes
They ache to be near you
To hold you here
In my fountain of love
Never be blue
Should your world start sinking
Just come and drink
From my fountain of love
Well build a new world off
On a high mountain
Well live
On our fountain of loveDrums of the islands youre beating in my heart
Youre with me no matter where I roam
If ever I wander if ever were apart
I know that you will lead me home
If I should journey across the deep blue sea
Ill never forget these coral shores
Drums of the islands I hear you calling me
And Ill return forever yours
I love each valley each grain of sand each hill
The flowers the music of the isles
These are the things I love and always will
Though I may roam ten thousand milesIll go on loving you
Dont ask me why
Dont know what else to do
Dont ask me why
How sad my heart would be
If you should go
Though youre not good for me
I want you so
Its not the kind
Of love I dream about
But its the kind
That I cant live without
Youre all Im longing for
Dont say good-bye
I need you more and more
Dont ask me why
I need you more and more
Dont ask me whyAm I ready can my heart be true
Am I ready to fall in love with you
One love one girlone dream shared by two

In a house that has everything everything but love
Crystal chandeliers chauffeured limousines
Yes youll really have everything everything but love
I see diamonds sables sapphires and pearls
And as the picture clears
Poor little rich girl sitting all alone
Counting her treasures in tears
Better just a shack where two people care
Than a house that has everything everything but love
I see diamonds sables sapphires and pearls
And as the picture clears
Poor little rich girl sitting all alone
Counting her treasures in tears
Better just a shack where two people care
Than a house that has everything everything but love
Than a house that has everything everything but loveTake the ribbon from your hair
Shake it loose and let it fall
Layin soft upon my skin
Like the shadows on the wall
Come and lay down by my side
Till the early mornin light
All Im takin is your time
Help me make it through the night
I dont care whos right or wrong
I dont try to understand
Let the devil take tomorrow
Lord tonight I need a friend
Yesterday is dead and gone
And tomorrows out of sight
And its sad to be aloneAs I read the letters that you wrote to me
Well its you its you that Im thinking of
As I read the lines that to me were so sweet
I remember our faded love
I miss you darlin more and more everyday
As heaven would miss the stars above
With every heartbeat I still think of you
And remember our faded love
As I think of the past all the pleasures that we had
As I watch the mating of the doves
It was in the springtime that you said goodbye
I remember our faded love
I miss you darlin more and more everyday
As heaven would miss the stars above
With every heartbeat I still think of you
And remember our faded loveWhen I was little my mama said to me
One day youll find a love to last eternally
I want you with me everywhere I go
So please dont leave me baby I love you so
Ill be the ruler of this whole wide world
If you will only say youll be my girl
I want you with me in everything I do
You know I need you baby Im in love with you
There is no mountain that I cant climb
You find the mountain child and Ill find the time
I want you with me with me night and day
Well you can make me happy baby dont you go away
Ill swim an ocean with a raging foam
If I know that youll be there when I come back home
I want you with me you know I love you so
Well I want you with me baby Ill never let you go
Well I want you with me baby Ill never let you goAre you sincere when you say I love you

Will our love grow are you sincere
Are you sincere when you say I love you
Honey are you sincere when you say you love me too
And are you really mine every day all the time
Ive gotta know which way to go
Will our love grow are you sincereDatin is a game that grown-ups play
Datin means acting in a silly way
Datin makes girls start wiggle walking
Datin makes a guy start baby talking
Dizzy like children on a merry-go-round
Grown-ups are the biggest kids Ive found
Youd think they belong in a baby carriage
Theyre doing things that lead to marriage
But dont you laugh at what they do oh no
Cause some day youll be datin too
Datin makes a guy comb his hair just right
His girl can mess it up when they kiss good-night
Datin makes you quarrel and say youll break up
And just because its so much fun to make up
Children cant wait to grow up but then
Theyre datin and theyre acting like kids again
Youd think they belong in a baby carriage
Theyre doing things that lead to marriage
But dont you laugh at what they do oh no
Some day youll be datin tooStill I recall all the good times together
The love we shared the fun and the laughter
How I wish you could feel what my heart says tonight dear
I miss you and I wish you were here
Dreams that I had they lay broken in sorrow
The plans I made the hopes for tomorrow
If I could I would tell you Im lonesome tonight dear
Oh I miss you and I wish you were here
All through the night I will see memories passing
The way you looked the sound of your laughing
How I long for the touch of your hand holding mine dear
Oh I miss you and I wish you were here
Lord I miss you and I wish you were hereHow would you like to be
A little circus clown
And you could wear a smile
Instead of a frown
How would you like to be
A little kangaroo
A-hoppin up and down
And I could hop with you
Come on and smile a little smile a little
Hop a little hop a little
Smile a little hop a little bit with me
Come on and smile a little smile a little
Hop a little hop a little
Smile a little hop a little bit with me
How would you like to be
A little buzzing bee
And instead of a tree
You could buzz around me
How would you like to be
A little mocking bird
And you can sing me songs
Like I never heard
Come on and buzz a little buzz a little
Sing a little sing a little
Buzz a little sing a little bit with me
Buzz buzz buzz a little
Do re mi a little
Buzz a little sing a little bit with me
How would you like to be
A little baby bear
And you can hug me tight
Any time you care
How would you like to be
A little dancing doll
And you could dance with me
Everytime I callFrom a jack to a king of loneliness to a wedding ring
Ive played a ace and I won the queen
I walked away with your heart
From a jack to a king
With no regrets I stacked I stacked the cards I stacked the cards last night
And lady luck played her hand just right
You made me king of your heart
Oh for just a little while I thought that I might lose the game
Oh but just in time I saw that twinkle in your eyes
From a jack to a king of loneliness to a wedding wedding wedding ring
I played an ace and I won the queen
You made me king of your heart
For just a little while I thought that I might lose the game
Oh but just in time I saw I saw that twinkle in your eyes
From a jack to a king from loneliness to a wedding wedding wedding ring
I played an ace and I won the queen
You made me king of your heartIf you found someone new who means more than me to you
Id never stand in your way
If you feel we must part dont let pity rule your heart
Ill never stand in your way
I love you much too much to ever lose you
But what is to be will be and ill obey
Ill be blue when you go but ill never let it show

Such an easy question
Why cant I get an answer
Tell me will you or wont you need me
Such an easy question
Why cant I get an answer
All you do is give a sigh
And beat around the bush
Can it be that youre too shy
To give yourself a little old push
Can you or cant you tell me yes
Its such an easy question
Why cant I get an answerEarth angel earth angel

Im just a fool
A fool in love with youWell down in New Orleans at the Golden Goose
I grabbed a green-eyed dolly that was on the loose
Well I dig that music well she said me too
I said pretty baby come on and lets do
The Dixieland Rock
Well the Dixieland Rock
Let your hair down Sugar--shake it free
And do the Dixieland Rock with me
With the blue light shining on her swinging hips
She got the drummer so nervous that he lost his sticks
The cornet player hit a note thats flat
The tromboner hit him while the poor cat sat
The Dixieland Rock
Well the Dixieland Rock
Let your hair down Sugar--shake it free
And do the Dixieland rock with me
I was all pooped out and when the clock struck four
But she said no daddy cant leave the floor
She wore a clinging dress that fit so tight
She couldnt sit down so we danced all night
The Dixieland Rock
Well the Dixieland Rock
Let your hair down Sugar--shake it free
And do the Dixieland Rock with me
Let your hair down Sugar--shake it
And do the Dixieland Rock with meFirst time I fell in love
I fell in love with you
First time I dared to dream
My only dream came true
Must be beginners luck
To wish upon a star
That opened up my eyes
And there you are
I wave no magic wand
I own no lucky charms
How then can I explain
An angel in my arms
Must be beginners luck
What else can it be
When someone wonderful as you
Loves meCowboy cowboy marry me

Come Saturday night Ill court a pretty girl
With a cane and a high starched collarOh you can take a whole lot of sand
And build a castle on the beach
And though you mold it and you plan
Still you got nothing in your reach
One little slip and it tumbles down
One wrong step and it crumbles all around
Like a house without love thats sure to fall apart
A house of sand is an empty work of art
You can build a tower of clay
But if you ask my advice
Well it is worthless as I say
I got no heart its cold as ice
One little slip and it tumbles down
One wrong step and it crumbles all around
Like a house without love thats sure to fall apart
A house of sand is an empty work of artAs you travel along on the Jericho Road
I would take young Johnny Cash to do this
Does the road seem all long and heavy your load
Just take it to Christ your sins all confess
On the Jericho Road your heart He will bless
On the Jericho RoadLa la la la la la la la la la la la la

Youd have taken the time to show me
I wouldnt be lonely
Where will I go who will I have to lie beside me
Is it something thats inside me
Im so lonely
Tried so hard each time each time I just cant make it
Feelin fast vibrations and I just cant take it
Living from day to day chasing the dream
Im Im leavin
La la la la la la la la la la la la la

Im almost in love tonight
When we are close my heart says surrender
Im almost in love tonight
And here under the spell of evening
I long to hold you tight
Heaven is near why think of tomorrow
Im almost in love tonight
It may be just the spell of evening
I long to hold you tight
Heaven is near why think of tomorrow
Im almost in love tonight
Almost in loveHot dog you say youre really coming back
Hot dog Im waiting at the railway track
Hot dog you say youre coming home for good
Hot dog Im going to keep knocking on wood
And baby I can hardly wait
Im gonna meet you at the gate hot dog
I fell in love with you and then you went away
But now youre coming home to stay
Hot dog soon everything will be all right
Hot dog were gonna have a ball tonight
Ive got a pocketful of dimes
Its gonna be just like old times hot dog
You went away and every day was misery
But now youre coming back to me
Hot dog my heart is gonna go insane
Hot dog when you come walking off the train
Oh how lonely I have been
But when that Santa Fe pulls in
Hot dog baby baby hot dogHear that old train whistle
Howling in the night
If that flyers southbound
Everything will be all right
Im leaving now leaving now leaving now
Im gonna get back home somehow
Dont nobody tell me
Babys been untrue
If shes been unfaithful
I dont know what Ill do
Im leaving now leaving now leaving now
Im gonna get back home somehow
Never thought that I could miss her so
I never thought I could now I know
The sound of the old train whistle
Makes me want to cry
Reminds me of that lonely feeling
When I said goodbye
Im leaving now leaving now leaving now
Im gonna get back home somehowI need Jesus to guide me every day
As Im travellin along this rough and narrow way
Though afflictions fill my soul
Im determined to make the goal
Ive gotta have Jesus cause I just cant make it by myself
Every day I pray pray pray pray
Pray pray pray pray
I pray pray pray pray
Pray pray pray
Pray and ask the Lord Jesus
Dont leave me by myself
Every mornin through the years I pray
You know Ive got to have Jesus
I just cant it by myself
By myselfI want my share of love it might as well be known
But I aint thinking of one girl to love alone
That aint the way its gonna be Im on my own and I am free
And Ive been satisfied so I dont wanna be tied
Somebodys loving arms can sure be sweet Ive found
But I want no-ones arms to ever hold me down
Once I get caught inside a net Im gonna run I bet
Im gonna run and hide I dont wanna be tied
Ive seen lovers who were matched they thought that love could stay
Once they cared and got attached it seems that love just slipped away
Dont want no claims on me
Dont want no chains that bind
As anyone could see
I say whats on my mind
Well there aint nothing I conceal Im gonna play the field
The field of love is wide
I dont wanna be tied
The field of love is wide
I dont wanna be tied
The field of love is wide
I dont wanna be tied
I said I dont I dont wanna be I dont wanna be tiedWish I was an apple dangling from a tree

I wish I was a bluebird Id never fly away
Id sit up on your shoulder baby and sing to you all day

Ive met her today
I used to think I just couldnt live
A day without you
In spite of the thousand doubts and tears
That you put me through
All at once I dont care as much for you
Im sorry to say
For now theres another
I met her today
How I treasured each smile each kiss
You gave to me now and then
Well you neednt be kind to me now
Oh no not ever againDo you know who I am
Have you have any idea who I am
Yes its been quite a while
And its so good to see you again
Its so dark in this place
That I cant see your face
May believe Oh I see
Does he know who I am
And what once was between you and me
Do you know how I tried
Have you any idea how I tried
Not to keep you in sight
Do you know darling how much I cried
I remember you said
That you had to forget about me and be free
Do you know who I am or have you forgot about me
Do you think theres a chance
You and I could start over again
Is there a prayer you still pray
Or has it just been too long and were through
Well what about you and him
Oh hes only a friend
Well I see theres still a chance for me
Well maybe some other time in some other place
With our love in your heart and a smile on your face
You will know who I am
When that time comes youll know who I am
You will know who I am
When that time comes youll know who I am
You will know who I am
When that time comes youll know who I amI look at you and wham Im head over heels
I guess that love is a banana peel
I feel so bad and yet Im feeling so well
I slipped I stumbled I fell
One crazy kiss and bam I head for the skies
I guess that love is like a cake of ice
You skate along but then you can never tell
I slipped I stumbled I fell
I never thought Id get tricked
By you sweet talking lies
Youve got a bag of tricks
And when you get busy
I got dazzled and dizzy
I fell like a ton of bricks
My knees are weak my head is spinning around
I guess that love has turned me upside down
Thought Id get hurt but gee its turning out well
I slipped I stumbled I fellAll en el rancho grande

A long way from the beach
cause someone shoved his face against my hand
Now Im a kissing cousin to a ripe pineapple

Just like a pig before he gave his all that aluhau

Cause he was telling everyone in town
About the love that he just found
And Maries the name of his latest flame
He talked and talked and I heard him say
That she had the longest blackest hair
The prettiest green eyes anywhere
And Maries the name of his latest flame
Though I smiled the tears inside were a-burning
I wished him luck and then he said goodbye
He was gone but still his words kept returning
What else was there for me to do but cry
Would you believe that yesterday
This girl was in my arms and swore to me
Shed be mine eternally
And Maries the name of his latest flame
Though I smiled the tears inside were a-burning
I wished him luck and then he said goodbye
He was gone but still his words kept returning
What else was there for me to do but cry
Would you believe that yesterday
This girl was in my arms and swore to me
Shed be mine eternally
And Maries the name of his latest flame
And Maries the name of his latest flame
And Maries the name of his latest flameLet the stars fade and fall
And I wont care at all
As long as I have you
Every kiss brings a thrill
And I know that it will
As long as I have you
Lets think of the future
Forget the past
Youre not my first love
But youre my last
Take the love that I bring

Theres just so much loving that one hearts supposed to do
So I go around with my heart dragging on the ground
Dogging me around Im the sorriest sight in town
Chorus
I got double trouble I got double trouble
I got double trouble twice as much as anybody else oh yeah
I guess theres gotta be two dark clouds hanging over me
My future looks a bumpy as a matchbox on the sea
Every time I think that I have finally got it made
Some losing cards are played I just cant make the grade
Chorus Well I went to the bayou just last night
There was no moon but the stars were bright
Put a big long hook on a big long pole
And I pulled Mr Crawfish out of his hole
Crawfish
See I got him see the size
Stripped and cleaned before your eyes
Sweet meat look fresh and ready to cook
Crawfish
Now take Mr Crawfish in your hand
Hes gonna look good in your frying pan
If you fry him crisp or you boil him right
Hell be sweeter than sugar when you take a bite
CrawfishIve been in love so many times
I thought I knew the score
Now youve treated me so wrong
I cant take any more
And it looks like Im never gonna fall in love again
Fall in love Im never gonna fall in love
I mean it I mean it fall in love again
I gave my heart so easily cast aside my pride
When I saw you in his arms baby
I broke up and cried
And it looks like Im never gonna fall in love again
Thats what Im sayin Fall in love No Im never gonna fall in love
Please dont make me fall in love againI was always baby I was always
Well almost always true to you
Met a pretty mademoiselle
Her papa owned a small hotel
Oh I was almost always true to you
I resisted tho my arm was twisted
I was almost always true to you
Stayed away from drinkin wine
Thought about you all the time
Oh I was almost always true to you
Kept refusin dont jump to conclusions
I was almost always true to you
I would never grab like this
I would never steal a kiss
Oh I was almost always true to youNever found a four leaf clover to bring good luck to me
No rabbits foot no lucky star no magic wishing tree
But I got lucky yes I got lucky
When I found you oh yeah
Got no rainbow around my shoulder no horseshoe on my door
But I got you to hold me tight and who could ask for more
Oh I got lucky yes I got lucky
When I found you
I always walk around with all my fingers crossed
Im afraid the love I found just might get lost
So wont you tell me that you love me hurry up and name the day
And then Ill know that my good luck is really here to stay
Oh I got lucky yes I got lucky
When I found you
I always walk around with all my fingers crossed
Im afraid the love I found just might get lost
So wont you tell me that you love me hurry up and name the day
And then Ill know that my good luck is really here to stay
Oh I got lucky yes I got lucky
When I found you
Oh I got lucky yes I got lucky
When I found youIts knowin that your door is always open
And your path is free to walk
That makes me tend to leave my sleepin bag
Rolled up and stashed behind your couch
And its knowin Im not shackled
By forgotten words and bonds
And the ink stains that have dried upon some line
That keeps you in the back roads
By the rivers of my memory
That keeps you ever gentle on my mind
Its not clingin to the rocks and ivy
Planted on their columns now that bind me
Or something that somebody said because
They thought we fit together walkin
Its just knowing that the world
Will not be cursing or forgiving
When I walk along some railroad track and find
That youre movin on the back roads
By the rivers of my memory
And for hours youre just gentle on my mind
Though the wheat fields and the clothes lines
And the junkyards and the highways come between us
And some other womans cryin to her mother
Cause she turned and I was gone
I still might run in silence
Tears of joy might stain my face
And the summer sun might burn me till Im blind
But not to where I cannot see
You walkin on the back roads
By the rivers flowin gentle on my mind
I dip my cup of soup back from a gurglin cracklin cauldron
In some train yard
My beard a rustlin coal pile
And a dirty hat pulled low across my face
Through cupped hands round a tin can
I pretend to hold you to my breast and find
That youre waitin from the back roads
By the rivers of my memory
Ever smilin ever gentle on my mindIm with a crowd but oh so alone
I still have the picture you sent me
And you signed it with love you recall
And the one of me that you wanted
Is now hanging face to the wall
At night Im never alone
Im afraid that Ill weaken and phone
And Im afraid that you will be gone
Im with a crowd but oh so aloneToday I passed you on the street
And my heart was at your feet
I cant help it if Im still in love with you
Somebody else stood by your side
And he looked so satisfied
I cant help it if Im still in love with you
A memory from the past came slowly stealing
As I braced your arm and walked so close to you yeah
Oh heaven only knows how much I miss you
I cant help it if Im still in love with you
I cant help it if Im still in love with youI thank the Lord for everything
When things are going my way
He said to me I will comfort thee
And drive your cares away
He promised me I will walk thee
And drive your cares away
I did not ask for riches
He gave me wealth untold
The moon the stars the sun the sky
Are there for you to behold
I thank the lord for everything
And I count my blessings each day
He came to me when I needed Him
I only have to pray
And Hell come to you if you ask Him to
Hes only a prayer awayI told her to leave me alone
Thats what shes done just what shes done
And a house built for two aint a home
When its lived in by one one lonely one
And I can no longer hear footsteps come right down the hall
Here come the teardrops bitter they are harder they fall
She caught me lying then she caught a train
And I caught a fever walking home in the rain
Oh yeah
But its over and Im done
She left me once and for all
Here come the teardrops bitter they are harder they fall
Here come the teardrops bitter they are harder they fallIn a little while youre leavin
Starting on the journey home
Soon Ill be alone the one who loves you
La la la la la somewhere in the heart of Rome
Ill make a wish in every fountain
Say a prayer that youll return
Minutes Ill be counting
May the fire of love still burn
Ill keep your picture by my pillow
And pretend Im not alone
Make believe that you are with me
La la la la la in the heart of Rome
Suddenly the tears are falling
As we hear the whistle blow
Hold me very close before you leave me
La la la la la somewhere in the heart of Rome
Ill make a wish in every fountain
Say a prayer that youll return
Minutes Ill be counting
May the fire of love still burn
Ill keep your picture by my pillow
And pretend Im not alone
Make believe that you are with me
La la la la la in the heart of RomeHappy ending happy ending
Give me a story with a happy ending
When boy meets girl and then
They never part again
But live forever happily like you and me
Our love story gets me so upset
Like romeo and juliet
Im not smart enough to figure why
Some folks enjoy a real good cry
Happy ending happy ending
Give me a story with a happy ending
When boy meets girl and then
They never part again
But live forever happily like you and me
Never thought that i would stand a chance
That youd give me a second glance
But i think that you can play the part
And give a guy a happy heart
Happy ending happy ending
Give me a story with a happy ending
When boy meets girl and then
They never part again
But live forever happily like you and me
When boy meets girl and then they never part again
But live forever happily like you and me
Like you and me like you and me
Like you and meDrums of the islands youre beating in my heart
Youre with me no matter where I roam
If ever I wander if ever were apart
I know that you will lead me home
If I should journey across the deep blue sea
Ill never forget these coral shores
Drums of the islands I hear you calling me
And Ill return forever yours
I love each valley each grain of sand each hill
The flowers the music of the isles
These are the things I love and always will
Though I may roam ten thousand milesFrankie and me we were lovers
Oh Lordy how we could love
Swore wed be true to each other
Just as true as stars above
I was her man she caught me doing her wrong
My luck in poker was fading
When a new gal caught my eye
I gambled I tried to change my luck
With a chick named Nellie Bly
I was Frankies man but I was doing her wrong
Yeah Frankie came looking to find me
Yes she wasnt looking for fun
For in her sweet loving hand
She was totin a forty-four gun
To shoot her man if he was doin her wrong
Well Frankie walked into the bar room
And right there in front of her eyes
There was her loving johnny
Making love to that Nellie Bly
I was her man she caught me doing her wrong
Frankie I beg please dont shoot me
Well theyll put you away in a cell
You know theyll put your where the cold wind blows
From the hottest corner in hell
Im your man I know I done you wrong
Easy on the roll real easy
Easy on the roll real slow
Roll me over real gently
cause my wound hurts me so
Well I was her man
Well I done her wrong
Well Frankie told johnny
Well this is the end of my song
I was her man well I done her wrong
Well hey hey hey hey hey

You dont like hotrod racin
Or drivin late at night
You just wanna park where its nice and dark
You just wanna hold me tight
Youre so square baby I dont care

The day you kissed me good luck was with me
And I thank my lucky stars above

Finders keepers losers weepers

He lost you and I found you

Come back in a hurry
Cause I need you soThis proud wild land where the wind blows free
Has always been a part of me
Its in my blood I just cant get it out
For a hundred miles a man can see
And be about as wild as he wants to be
If he feels like shouting all hes gotta do is shout
Where the purple mountains reach up high
And look like theyre gonna touch the sky
Where the canyon walls have stood for a million years
Where the days are hot the nights are cold
The desert sand looks just like gold
These trails were carved in sweat and blood and tears
Where the painted desert as you pass by
Looks like a rainbow in the sky
The cactus blooms in the early morning sun
Where the night wings sing and eagles fly
The clouds paint pictures in the sky
The coyotes howl tells you when the day is done
Im coming home this time Im gonna stay
Im coming home and I aint never goin away
My feet are itching to get back home
Ive had the desert fever since Ive been gone
I need some loving so bad that I cant see
When a woman looks a man in the eye
You know it takes a man to satisfy
Thinking about them girls is killing meAha-ha hurry hurry step this way
Aha-ha hurry hurry step this way
Now the show youre going to see is strictly high class
Therell be ten hoola dancers shaking their grass
So step right up and put your money down
This way to Carny Town
We got a man so skinny you can see his bones
We play on his ribs like a xylophone
With a pair of spoons we get a rockin song
Youll hear it all in Carny Town
Hurry hurry hurry the house is almost full
We got a two headed cow and thats no bull
Theres a man who swallows swords and he never gets hurt
He eats razor blades for dessert
Hes just about the sharpest guy around
Youll see him here in Carny Town
Aha-ha hurry hurry step this way
Aha-ha hurry hurry step this way
Aha-ha hurry hurry step this way
Aha-ha hurry hurry step this way
Aha-ha I say were gonna win

Keep a-movin move along keep a moving
Ive got to follow that dream wherever that dream may lead
Ive got to follow that dream to find the love I need
When your heart gets restless time to move along
When your heart gets weary time to sing a song
But when a dream is calling you
Theres just one thing that you can do
Well you gotta follow that dream wherever that dream may lead
You gotta follow that dream to find the love you need
Keep a-movin move along keep a moving
Got to find me someone whose heart is free
Someone to look for my dream with me

Baby if youll give me all of your love
Baby if youll give me all of your love

But even though you hurt me like nobody else could ever do
I would never ever hurt you oh you no youHow many roads must a man walk down
Before you call him a man
Yes and how many seas must a white dove sail
Before she sleeps in the sand
Yes and how many times must cannonballs fly
Before theyre forever banned
The answer my friend is blowin in the wind
The answer is blowin in the wind
How many times must a man look up
Before he can see the sky
How many ears must one man have
Before he can hear people cry
How many deaths will it take till he knows
That too many people have died
The answer my friend is blowin in the wind
The answer is blowin in the wind
How many years can a mountain exist
Before its washed to the seas sea
How many years can some people exist
Before theyre allowed to be free
How many times can a man turn his head
Pretend that he just doesnt see
The answer my friend is blowin in the wind
The answer is blowin in the windAll that I am or ever hope to be
Lies in your hands
You are my destiny
When you are in my arms I rule the world

It opens the door to miracles of spring
It takes you to wishing wells
To ice cream and carousels

Im a poor hawaiian beach boy
A long way from the beach
cause someone shoved his face against my hand
Now Im a kissing cousin to a ripe pineapple
Im in the can

But drinking daddys juice
I swear Ill never touch that stuff again
Just like a pig before he gave his all that aluhau
Im in the pen
Got those beach boy blues
Dont the time go slow
Lonely beach boy blues
Only thirty days and ninety years to go
I want a taste of honey
From my wahinis lips
I want to be her ever loving man
But Im a kissing cousin to a ripe pineapple

And my heart is anywhere you are
Anywhere you are is home
I dont need a mansion on a hill
That overlooks the sea
Anywhere youre with me is home
Maybe Im a rolling stone
Who wont amount to much
But everything that I hold dear
Is close enough to touch
For home is where the heart is
And my heart is anywhere you are
Anywhere you are is home
Maybe Im a rolling stone
Who wont amount to much
But everything that I hold dear
Is close enough to touchI saw old pharaohs daughter bring Moses from the water

Take a look around tell me what you see
Here I stand like an open book
Is there something here you might have overlooked
Cause it would be a shame if you should leave
And find that freedom aint what you thought it would be
The years we had were not all bad
In fact I know the good outweighed the bad
Now you say that youve grown tired
You want to be by yourself a while
It would be a shame if you should go
And find that freedom was a long time ago
I know that you cant stand the chains that bind you
They just keep on drivin us apart
You could go where I could never find you
But could you go far enough to get away from your heart
So one more time for ol times sake

My lucky number is thirteen
Where do I belong everything I do is wrong all wrong
Wrong as can be
Whos stacking all the decks lady luck has got the hex on me
Im on her kneeOh Danny boy the pipes the pipes are calling
From glen to glen and down the mountain side
The summers gone and all the roses dying
Tis you tis you must go and I must bye
But come ye back when summers in the meadow
Or when the valleys hushed and white with snow
And Ill be here in sunshine or in shadow
Oh Danny boy oh Danny boy I love you so
But if he come and all the roses dying
And I am dead as dead I well may be
Hell come here and find the place where I am lying
And kneel and say an ava there for me
And I shall feel oh soft you tread above me
And then my grave will richer sweeter be
For you will bend and tell me that you love me
And I shall rest in peace until you come to meSome kids born with a silver spoon

Just hang out one silly moon
Oh Theyve got their love torches burning
When they should be playing it cool
I used to laugh but now Im the same
Take a look at a brand new fool
Fools fall in love just like schoolgirls
Blinded by rose colored dreams
They build their castles on wishes
With only rainbows for beams
Oh Theyre making plans for the future
When they should be right back in school
I used to laugh but now Im the same
Take a look at a brand new fool
All right
Theyve got their love torches burning
When they should be playing it cool
I used to laugh but now Im the same

Who went to meet El Toro
Though he fought as he had never done before
He could not beat El Toro
The bull El Toro brought him defeat and pain
And to his sorrow the matador knew shame
They said time would never heal the many scars
Brought by the great El Toro
And the bitterness that burned deep in his heart
Caused him to hate El Toro
The bull El Toro brought him defeat and pain
And to his sorrow the matador knew shame
So one night when no-one was on sight
The matador went to finish the score
In the lonely fields beneath the pale moonlight
He fought the bulland they fought once more
When they found the matador and saw him dying
Hed never see tomorrow
Now they say that on the spot where he was lying
Still walks the proud El Toro
The bull El Toro brought him defeat and pain
And to his sorrow the matador knew shameYour lips your eyes your soft sweet sights

Whoa oh oh

Whoa oh whoa oh whoa ohThe old home town looks the same
As I step down from the train
And there to meet me is my mama and papa
Down the road I look and there runs Mary
Hair of gold and lips like cherries
Its good to touch the green green grass of home
Yes theyll all come to meet me
Arms areaching smiling sweetly
Its good to touch the green green grass of home
The old house is still standing
Though the paint is cracked and dry
And theres that old oak tree that I used to play on
Down the lane I walk and with my sweet Mary
Hair of gold and lips like cherries
Its good to touch the green green grass of home
Then I awake and look around me
At four gray walls that surround me
And I realize that I was only dreaming
For theres a guard and theres a sad old padre
Arm and arm well walk at daybreak
Again Ill touch the green green grass of home
Yes theyll all come to see me
In the shade of that old oak tree
As they lay me neath the green green grass of homeWhen Youre weary feeling small
When tears are in your eyes I will dry them all
Im on your site oh When times get rough
And friends just cant be found
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
Oh like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
When youre down and out when youre on the streets
When evening falls so hard I will comfort you
Ill take your part when the darkness falls and pain is all around
Yes like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
Oh like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
Sail on silver girl sail on by
Your time has come to shine
All your dreams are on their way
See how they shine
Oh if you need a friend
Im sailing right behind
Yes like a bridge over troubled water
I I will ease your mind
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will easy your mindHow the web was woven
In my soul dont you know
How the web was woven
Cant get loose cant let go
Like the weave of a spider
Wound around my heart
Im no longer free
At last Im where you want me
Dont you know thats where I want to be
Spinning round like a blue fly
Thoughts of you fill my head
And no matter oh how I try
I cant sleep in my bed
Ive been round for the last time
Oh girl what can I do
Oh the time the web was woven
How I fell in love fell in love with youI just cant help believin
When she smiles up soft and gentle
With a trace of misty morning
And the promise of tomorrow in her eyes
I just cant help believin
When shes lying close beside me
And my heart beats with the rhythm of her sighs
This time the girl is gonna stay
This time the girl is gonna stay
For more than just a day
Oh I just cant help believin
When she slips her hand in my hand
And it feels so small and helpless
As my fingers fold around it like a glove
I just cant help believin
When shes whispering her magic
And her tears are shining honey sweet with love
This time the girl is gonna stay
This time the girl is gonna stay
For more than just a day
For more than just a dayA very old friend came by today
Cause he was telling everyone in town
About the love that he just found
And Maries the name of his latest flame
He talked and talked and I heard him say
That she had the longest blackest hair
The prettiest green eyes anywhere

Ringing in my ears
Dont cry daddy

Daddy youve still got me and little Tommy
And together well find a brand new mommy
Daddy daddy please laugh again

Oh daddy please dont cry
Why are children always first
To feel the pain and the hurt the worst
Its true but somehow
It just dont seem right
Cause every time I cry I know
It hurts my little children so I wonder
Will it be the same tonight
Dont cry daddy

Daddy youve still got me and little Tommy
And together well find a brand new mommy

As she walked home from shcool
And then her deathbed soon claimed her
It made us so sad and so blue
Then she called me close to her bedside
And whispered these words soft and low
Tell mommy to come to me quickly
I want to kiss you both and go
Chorus
I hear a sweet voice calling
Way up in Heaven on high
God has made room for your daughter
Oh mommy and daddy dont cry
Take care of little brother
Tell him Im gone to rest
I know his little heart is broken
Hes all that you have left
Then she closed eyes forever
Never to see us no more
Until we meet our darlin
On that bright and peaceful shore
Chorus I long to be His possession
Oh He is my everything
I remember my days of darkness
Without sunshine or sight to lead the way
But a whisper of His voice softly calling
To the arms of my Maker to stay
He is my reason for living
Oh He is the king of all kings
I long to be His possession
Oh He is my everything
After the lighting and thunder
After the last bell has rung
I want to bow down before Him
And hear Him say well done
He is my reason for living
Oh He is the king of all kings
I long to be His possession
Oh He is my everythingOh well Im tired and so weary
But I must go alone
Till the Lord comes and calls
Calls me away oh yes
Well the mornings so bright
And the lamp is alight
And the night night is as black
As the sea oh yes
There will be peace in the valley for me some day
There will be peace in the valley for me oh Lord I pray
Therell be no sadness no sorrow
No trouble trouble I see
There will be peace in the valley for me for me
Well the bear will be gentle
And the wolves will be tame
And the lion shall lay down by the lamb oh yes
And the beasts from the wild
Shall be lit by a child
And Ill be changed
Changed from this creature that I am oh yes
There will be peace in the valley for me some day
There will be peace in the valley for me oh Lord I pray
Therell be no sadness no sorrow
No trouble trouble I see
There will be peace in the valley for me for meSix foot six stood on the ground weighted two hundred and thirty-five pounds
But I saw that giant of a man brought down to his knees by love
He was the kind of man who would gamble on love
Look you in the eye and never back up
But I saw him crying like a little whipped pup because of love
Cant see it with your eyes hold it in your hands
Like the rules that govern our land
Strong enough to rule the heart of every man this thing called love
It can lift you up it can put you down
Take your world and turn it all around
Ever since time nothings ever been found stronger than love
Men like me they worry and doubt
Trouble their minds day in and day out
Too busy a livin to worry about a thing called love
And then I see a mothers tenderness
As she holds her young close to her breast
Then I say thank God this world will win with the thing called loveIm gonna lay down my burden down by the riverside
Down by the riverside down by the riverside
Im gonna lay down my burden down by the riverside
Im gonna study war no more
I aint a gonna study war no more I aint a gonna study war no more
I aint a gonna study war no more I aint a gonna study war no more
I aint a gonna study war no more I aint a gonna study war no more
Well Im gonna put on my long white robe Where down by the riverside Oh
Down by the riverside down by the riverside
Im gonna put on my long white robe Where down by the riverside
Im gonna study war no more
I aint a gonna study war no more I aint a gonna study war no more
I aint a gonna study war no more I aint a gonna study war no more
I aint a gonna study war no more I aint a gonna study war no more
Well Im gonna lay down my sword and shield Where down by the riverside
Down by the riverside down by the riverside
Im gonna lay down my sword and shield A-ha down by the riverside
Im gonna study war no more
I aint a gonna study war no more I aint a gonna study war no more
I aint a gonna study war no more I aint a gonna study war no more
I aint a gonna study war no more I aint a gonna study war no moreTempted and tried were oft made to wonder
Why it should be thus all the day long
While there are others living about us
Never molested though in the wrong
Farther along well know more about it
Farther along well understand why
Cheer up my brother live in the sunshine
Well understand it all by and by
When death has come and taken our loved ones
Leaving our homes so lonely and drear
Then do we wonder how others prosper
Living so wicked year after year
Farther along well know more about it
Farther along well understand why
Cheer up my brother live in the sunshine
Well understand it all by and byAmazing Grace
How sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now am found
Was blind but now I see
Twas Grace that taught my heart to fear
And Grace my fears relieved
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed
Through many dangers toils and snares
I have already come
Tis Grace has brought me safe thus far
And Grace will lead me home
The Lord has promised good to me
His word my hope secures
He will my shield and portion be
As long as life endures
Yet when this flesh and heart shall fail
And mortal life shall cease
I shall possess within the veil
A life of joy and peace
When weve been there ten thousand years
Bright shining as the sun
Weve no less days to sing Gods praise
Than when weve first begunYou saw me crying in the chapel
The tears I shed were tears of joy
I know the meaning of contentment
I am happy with the Lord
Just a plain and simple chapel
Where all good people go to pray
I prayed the Lord that Ill grow stronger
As I live from day to day
I searched and I searched but I couldnt find
No way on earth to find peace of mind
Now Im happy in the chapel
Where people are of one accord
Yes we gather in the chapel
Just to sing and praise the Lord
Youll search and youll search but youll never find
No way on earth to find peace of mind
Take your troubles to the chapel
Get down on your knees and pray
Then your burdens will be lighter
And youll surely find a wayPrecious Lord take my hand
Lead me on let me stand
I am tired
I am weak
I am warm
Through the storm through the night
Lead me on to the light
Take my hand precious lord lead me home
When my way grows drear
Precious Lord linger near
When my life is almost gone
Hear my cry hear my call
Hold my hand lest I fall
Take my hand precious lord lead me home
When the darkness appears and the night draws near
And the day is past and gone
Let the river where I stand guide my feet hold my hand
Take my hand precious lord lead me home
Take my hand precious lord lead me homeI need Jesus to guide me every day

Im a poor hawaiian beach boy
A long way from the beach
cause someone shoved his face against my hand
Now Im a kissing cousin to a ripe pineapple
Im in the can
I was minding my own business
But drinking daddys juice
I swear Ill never touch that stuff again
Just like a pig before he gave his all that aluhau
Im in the pen
Got those beach boy blues
Dont the time go slow
Lonely beach boy blues
Only thirty days and ninety years to go
I want a taste of honey
From my wahinis lips
I want to be her ever loving man
But Im a kissing cousin to a ripe pineapple
Im in the canWise men say only fools rush in
But I cant help falling in love with you
Shall I stay
Would it be a sin
If I cant help falling in love with you
Like a river flows surely to the sea
Darling so it goes
Some things are meant to be
Take my hand take my whole life too
For I cant help falling in love with you
Like a river flows surely to the sea
Darling so it goes
Some things are meant to be
Take my hand take my whole life too
For I cant help falling in love with you

In a house that has everything everything but love
Crystal chandeliers chauffeured limousines

Counting her treasures in tears
Better just a shack where two people care
Than a house that has everything everything but love

Counting her treasures in tears

Just a big a big a big a hunk o love will do
Just a big a big a big a hunk o love will doAre you lonesome tonight
Do you miss me tonight
Are you sorry we drifted apart
Does your memory stray to a brighter sunny day
When I kissed you and called you sweetheart
Do the chairs in your parlor seem empty and bare
Do you gaze at your doorstep and picture me there
Is your heart filled with pain shall I come back again
Tell me dear are you lonesome tonight
I wonder if youre lonesome tonight
You know someone said that the worlds a stage
And each must play a part
Fate had me playing in love you as my sweet heart
Act one was when we met I loved you at first glance
You read your line so cleverly and never missed a cue
Then came act two you seemed to change and you acted strange
And why Ill never know
Honey you lied when you said you loved me
And I had no cause to doubt you
But Id rather go on hearing your lies
Than go on living without you
Now the stage is bare and Im standing there
With emptiness all around
And if you wont come back to me
Then make them bring the curtain down
Is your heart filled with pain shall I come back again
Tell me dear are you lonesome tonightWell since my baby left me
Well I found a new place to dwell
Well its down at the end of Lonely Street
At Heartbreak Hotel
Where Ill be Ill be so lonely baby
Well Im so lonely
Ill be so lonely I could die
Although its always crowded
You still can find some room
For broken-hearted lovers
To cry there in the gloom
And be so where theyll be so lonely baby
Well theyre so lonely
Theyre so lonely they could die
Now the bell hops tears keep flowin
And the desk clerks dressed in black
Well theyve been so long on Lonely Street
Well theyll never theyll never look back
And theyll be so where theyll be so lonely baby
Well theyre so lonely
Theyre so lonely they could die
Well now if your baby leaves you
And you have a sad tale to tell
Just take a walk down Lonely Street
To Heartbreak Hotel
And you will be you will be you will be lonely baby
Youll be so lonely
Youll be so lonely you could dieA wella bless my soul

I stand dethroned Im naked and I bleed
But when your finger points so savagely
Is anybody there to believe in me
To hear my plea and take care of me
How can I go on from day to day
Who can make me strong in every way
Where can I be safe where can I belong
In this great big world of sadness
How can I forget those beautiful dreams that we shared
Theyre lost and theyre nowhere to be found
How can I go on
Sometimes I seem to tremble in the dark I cannot see
When people frighten me
I try to hide myself so far from the crowd
Is anybody there to comfort me
Lord take care of me
How can I go on how can I go on
From day to day from day to day
Who can make me strong who can make me strong
In every way in every way
Where can f be safe where can I be safe
Where can I belong where can I belong

How can I forget how can I forget

Theyre lost and theyre nowhere to be found
How can I go onEn mi sueno te vi
Tu luz llegaba de tan lejos
Vibra en ti
Suavemente me llevaba a ti
Tu voz dulcemente
Me decia Ven
Ven junto a mi
Saber que mi sueno no esta solo
Alienta en ti
Tu y yo cantados los dos
Yo sonaba en ser tu mismo mar tu mar
Es puente de union
De nuestras almas
Vuelan nos llaman
Al son de la eternidad
AaaahaahahahaaThe boy had a way with words he sang he moved with grace
He entertained so naturally no gesture out of place
His road in life was clearly drawn he didnt hesitate
He played they saw he conquered as the master of
As the master of his fate
The girl had an iron soul no-one could recognize
Material ambition that her gentleness disguised
She gave herself to him certain of his fame
Wanted him for luxury for limelight and his name
And then he sang to her
I love you for your silence
I love you for your peace
The still and calm releases
That sweep into my soul
That slowly take control
I love you for your passion
I love you for your fire
The violent desire
That burns me in its flame
A love I dare not name
His rise was irresistible - yeah he grew into the part
His explanation simply that he suffered for his art
No base considerations of some glittering reward
The prize was knowing that his work his work was noticed and adored
Hey
I love you yes I love you for your silence for your silence
I love you for your peace for your peace
The still and calm releases
That sweep into my soul
And slowly slowly takes control
He told the truth
Yes he told the truth and he told the truth
Accepting every honor with with a masterly display display
Of well rehearsed reluctance to be singled out this way
He started to believe that he was all they said and more and more
She forgot she forgot the reasons reasons she had wanted him before
Yeah
I love you for your passion for your passion
I love you for your fire
The violent desire
That burns me in its flame burns me
A love I dare not name
The still and calm releases releases
That sweep into my soul sweep into my soul
That slowly slowly slowly slowly slowly slowly
Slowly slowly slowly slowly slowly slowly slowly take control
And when at last they fell apart she wished that she could be
The hardened heart of yesterday as cynical as he
By changing for the better she had changed things for the worse
The words that made them happy once now echoed echoed as a curse
AaahaaahaahaahaaaI had this perfect dream
Un sueno me envolvio
This dream was me and you
Tal vez esta aqui
I want all the world to see
Un instinto me guiaba
A miracle sensation
My guide and inspiration
Now my dream is slowly coming true
The wind is a gentle breeze
EI me hablo de ti
The bells are ringing out
EI canto vuela
Theyre calling us together
Guiding us forever
Wish my dream would never go away

WohIn my defense what is there to say
All the mistakes weve made must be faced today
Its not easy now knowing where to start
While the world we love tears itself apart
Im just a singer with a song
How can I try to right the wrong
For just a singer with a melody
Im caught in between with a fading dream
In my defense what is there to say
We destroy the love its our way
We never listen enough never face the truth
Then like a passing song love is here
And then its gone
Im just a singer with a song
How can I try to right the wrong
For just a singer with a melody
Im caught in between with a fading dream
Im just a singer with a song
How can I try to right the wrong
For just a singer with a melody
Im caught in between with a fading dream
Caught in between with a fading dream
Caught in between with a fading dream
Oh what on Earth Oh what on Earth
How do I try
Do we live or die
Oh help me God
Please help meI think Im goin back
To the things I learned so well in my youth
I think Im returning to
The days when I was young enough to know the truth
Now there are no games
To only pass the time
No more coloring books
No Christmas bells to chime
But thinking young and growing older is no sin
And I can play the game of life to win
I can recall a time
When I wasnt afraid to reach out to a friend
And now I think Ive got
A lot more than a skipping rope to lift
Now theres more to do
Than watch my sailboat glide
Then everyday can be my magic carpet ride
And I can play hide and seek with my fears
And live my life instead of counting my years
Let everyone debate the true reality
Id rather see the world the way it used to be
A little bit of freedom all were left
So catch me if you can
Im goin back
I can recall
I can remember
I can recall
I can remember
I can recall
I can rememberAhhhhhh oooooo
This is the way
I always dreamed it would be
The way that it is oh oh
When you are holding me
I never had a love of my own
Maybe thats why when were all alone
I can hear music

The sound of the city baby seems to disappear
I can hear music
Sweet sweet music
Whenever you touch me baby
Whenever youre near
Lovin you

And I cant explain oh no

Insatiable in appetite
Wanna try
To avoid complications
She never kept the same address
In conversation
She spoke like a baroness
Met a man from China
Went down to Geisha Minah
Then again incidentally
If youre that way inclined
Perfume came naturally from Paris
For cars she couldnt care less
Fastidious and precise
Chorus
Drop of a hat shes a willing as
Playful as a pussy cat
Then momentarily out of action
Temporarily out of gas
To absolutely drive you wild wild
Shes all out to get you

When the father steps aside

Oh-ohI forgot what my father said
I forgot what he said
I forgot what my mother said
As we lay upon your bed
A city full of flowers
A city full of rain
I got seven days to live my life
Or seven ways to die
I forgot what my brother said
I forgot what he said
I dont regret anything at all
I remember how we wept
On a bridge of violent people
I was small enough to cry
I got seven days to live my life
Or seven ways to die
Hold my face before you
Still my trembling heart
Seven days to live my life
Or seven ways to die
The gods forgot they made me
So I forget them too
I listen to the shadows
I play among their graves
My heart was never broken
My patience never tried
I got seven days to live my life
Or seven ways to die
Seven days to live my life
Or seven ways to die
SevenI cant read and I cant write down
I dont know a book from countdown
I dont care which shadow gets me
All Ive got is someones face
Money goes to money heaven
Bodies go to body hell
I just cough and catch the chase
Switch the channel watch the police car
I cant read shit anymore
I just sit back and ignore
Cause I just cant get it right cant get it right
I cant read shit I cant read shit
When you see a famous smile
No matter where you run your mile
To be right in that photograph
Andy wheres my fifteen minutes fifteen yeahAll of my life Ive tried so hard
Doing my best with what I had
Nothing much happened all the same
Something about me stood apart
A whisper of hope that seemed to fail
Maybe Im born right out of my time
Breaking my life in two
Throw me tomorrow oh oh
Now that I really got a chance
Throw me tomorrow oh oh
Everythings falling into place
Throw me tomorrow oh oh
Seeing my past to let it go
Throw me tomorrow oh oh
Only for you I dont regret
And I was Thursdays child
Monday Tuesday Wednesday born I was
Monday Tuesday Wednesday born I was
Sometimes I cry my heart to sleep
Shuffling days and lonesome nights
Sometimes my courage fell to my feet
Lucky old son is in my sky
Nothing prepared me for your smile
Lighting the darkness of my soul
Innocence in your arms
Throw me tomorrow oh oh
Now that I really got a chance
Throw me tomorrow oh oh
Oh ho everythings falling into place
Throw me tomorrow oh oh
Seeing my past to let it go
Throw me tomorrow oh oh
Only for you I dont regret

Naked eyes
I should have kept you
I should have tried
I should have been a wiser kind of guy

Give me wings
Give me space
Give me money for a change of face
Those noisy rooms and passion pants

Wheres the morning in my life
Wheres the sense in staying right
Who said time is on my side
Ive got ears and eyes and nothing in my life
But Ill survive your naked eyes
Ill survive
You alone across the floor
You and me and nothing more
Youre the great mistake I never made
I never lied to you I hated when you lied
But Ill survive your naked eyes
Ill survive
Beatle boys all snowy white
Razzle dazzle clubs every night
Wish Id sent a Valentine

Well creep together you and I
For I know who this warfriend is likeTheres a full time reservation
Made in a bar at the railway station
And theres a story a kind of fable
On a card at the corner table
On it is a message been there some time
It starts of The coffee tasted so fine
It says One day this may find you
These few words may remind you
We sat here together just to pass time
You said how the coffee tasted so fine
It goes on to say I love you
If you should find this I must hear from you
It gives a number but the name has faded away
All that is left are just the words Maybe someday
Thats the story and the fable
Never leave alone from a corner table

Like the dolphins
Like dolphins can swim
Though nothing nothing will keep us together
We can beat them forever and ever
Oh we can be heroes just for one day
I I will be King
And you you will be Queen
Though nothing will drive them away
We can be heroes just for one day
We can be us just for one day
I I can remember
I remember
Standing by the wall
By the wall
And the guns shot above our heads
Over our heads
And we kissed as though nothing could fall
Nothing could fall
And the shame was on the other side
Oh we can beat them forever and ever
Then we could be heroes just for one day
We can be heroes
We can be heroes
We can be heroes just for one day
We can be heroesDid you ever have a dream or two
Where the hero is a guy named you
And the things he does are just too much
Does he fly like Mr Superman speak Chinese French and Dutch
And did you ever have a dream or two
Have you ever woken up one day
With the feeling that youd been away
If the girl that you dreamed of last night
Had the same dream in the very same scene
With the very same boy hold tight
Its a very special knowledge that youve got my friend
You can travel anywhere with anyone you care
Its a very special knowledge that youve got my friend
You can walk around in New York while you sleep in Penge
I will travel round the world one night
On the magic wings of astral flight
If youve got the secret tell me do
Have you ever had a dream or two
Have you ever had a dream or twoI
I will be king
And you
You will be queen
Though nothing will
Drive them away
We can beat them
Just for one day
We can be Heroes
Just for one day
And you
You can be mean
And I
Ill drink all the time
Cause were lovers
And that is a fact
Yes were lovers
And that is that
Though nothing
Will keep us together
We could steal time
Just for one day
We can be Heroes
For ever and ever
What dyou say

Niemand gibt uns eine Chance
Doch wir koennen siegen
Fuer immer und immer

Auch wenn sie
Unschlagbar scheinen
Werden wir Helden
Fuer einen Tag
Wir sind dann wir
An diesem Tag
Ich
Ich glaub das zu traeumen
die Mauer
Im Ruecken war kalt
Schuesse peitschen die Luft
Doch wir kuessen
Als ob nichts geschieht
Und die Scham fiel auf ihre Seite
Oh wir koennen sie schlagen
Fuer alle Zeiten
Dann sind wir Helden
Nur diesen Tag
Dann sind wir Helden
Dann sind wir Helden
Dann sind wir Helden
Nur diesen Tag
Dann sind wir Helden

Waiting at the lights know what I mean
Scary monsters super creeps

She asked me to stay and I stole her room
She asked for my love and I gave her a dangerous mind
Now shes stupid in the street and she cant socialise

Now its time to leave the capsule if you dare
This is Major Tom to Ground Control
Im stepping through the door
And Im floating in a most peculiar way
And the stars look very different today
For here
Am I sitting in a tin can
Far above the world
Planet Earth is blue
And theres nothing I can do
Though Im past one hundred thousand miles
Im feeling very still
And I think my spaceship knows which way to go
Tell my wife I love her very much she knows

Your circuits dead theres something wrong
Can you hear me Major Tom

Telling me that youve made money
Do you think im gonna crawl then think again
Though im dressed in rags im richer
Though i eat from tins im healthier
Though i live in slums im purer than you my friend
Too bad im not losing sleep
too bad im just counting sheep

Look around and see the friends
The ones you left our friends deserted
See the guys that used to talk and drink with you
Dont look down your nose at me

I wont be your yes-sir man for anything
Too bad im not losing sleep
too bad im just counting sheep
too bad im not losing sleep my friend
I would walk with you
Talk with you drink with you
If you drop that halo that youre wearing on the ground
Too bad im not losing sleep

I could escape this feeling with my China girl
I feel a wreck without my little China girl
I hear her heart beating loud as thunder
Saw they stars crashing
Im a mess without my little China girl
Wake up mornings wheres my little China girl
I hear her hearts beating loud as thunder
Saw they stars crashing down
I feel a-tragic like Im Marlon Brando
When I look at my China girl
I could pretend that nothing really meant too much
When I look at my China girl
I stumble into town just like a sacred cow
Visions of swastikas in my head
Plans for everyone
Its in the whites of my eyes
My little China girl
You shouldnt mess with me
Ill ruin everything you are
You know Ill give you television
Ill give you eyes of blue
Ill give you mens who want to rule the world
And when I get excited
My little China girl says
Oh baby just you shut your mouth
She says sh-sh-shhh

All coppers are nanas

Leave em a note saying Happy New Year
I know all the best ways to break out of here
I helped a young laddie called Ivan
I bundled him over the wall last night
Then he climbed back and he grabbed me tight
He uttered some words that I cant say to you
Cause he remembered that he was a screw
Over the wall we go
All coppers are nanas
Over the wall we go
Leave em a note saying Happy New Year
My name is Henry though some say Im thick
Ive spent half me life in and out of the nick
My mum sends me presents to keep me in style
Soggy old cakes and hundreds of files
Now I sussed all them files Im a clever young man
Now I look stupid with manicured hands
Over the wall we go

In such an early song
Ive heard a rumor from Ground Control
Oh no dont say its true
They got a message from the Action Man
Im happy hope youre happy too
Ive loved all Ive needed love
Sordid details following
The shrieking of nothing is killing just
Pictures of Jap girls in synthesis and I
Aint got no money and I aint got no hair
But Im hoping to kick but the planet its glowing
Ashes to ashes funk to funky
We know Major Toms a junkie
Strung out in heavens high
Hitting an all-time low
Time and again I tell myself
Ill stay clean tonight
But the little green wheels are following me
Oh no not again
Im stuck with a valuable friend
Im happy hope youre happy too
One flash of light but no smoking pistol
I never done good things I never done good things
I never done bad things I never done bad things
I never did anything out of the blue woh-o-oh
Want an axe to break the ice
Wanna come down right now
Ashes to ashes funk to funky
We know Major Toms a junkie
Strung out in heavens high
Hitting an all-time low
My mother said to get things done
Youd better not mess with Major Tom

Pressure pushing down on me
Pressing down on you no man ask for
Under pressure that brings a building down
Splits a family in two
Puts people on streets
Um ba ba be
Um ba ba be
De day da
Ee day da thats okay
Its the terror of knowing
What the world is about
Watching some good friends
Screaming Let me out
Pray tomorrow gets me higher
Pressure on people people on streets
Day day de mm hm

Its the terror of knowing

Watching some good friends
Screaming Let me out
Pray tomorrow - gets me higher higher high
Pressure on people people on streets
Turned away from it all like a blind man
Sat on a fence but it dont work
Keep coming up with love but its so slashed and torn
Why why why
Love love love love love
Insanity laughs under pressure were breaking
Cant we give ourselves one more chance
Why cant we give love that one more chance
Why cant we give love give love give love give love
Give love give love give love give love give love
Cause loves such an old fashioned word
And love dares you to care for
The people on the People on streets edge of the night
And loves People on streets dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves
This is our last dance
This is ourselves
Under pressure

Though nothing nothing will keep us together
We can beat them forever and ever
Oh we can be heroes just for one day
I I will be King
And you you will be Queen
Though nothing will drive them away
We can be heroes just for one day
We can be us just for one day
I I can remember
I remember
Standing by the wall
By the wall
And the guns shot above our heads
Over our heads
And we kissed as though nothing could fall
Nothing could fall
And the shame was on the other side
Oh we can beat them forever and ever
Then we could be heroes just for one day
We can be heroes
We can be heroes
We can be heroes just for one day
We can be heroesIve nothing much to offer
Theres nothing much to take
Im an absolute beginner
But Im absolutely sane
As long as were together
The rest can go to hell
I absolutely love you
But were absolute beginners
With eyes completely open
But nervous all the same
If our love song
Could fly over mountains
Could laugh at the ocean
Just like the films
Theres no reason
To feel all the hard times
To lay down the hard lines
Its absolutely true
Nothing much could happen
Nothing we cant shake
Oh were absolute beginners
With nothing much at stake
As long as youre still smiling
Theres nothing more I need
I absolutely love you
But were absolute beginners
But if my love is your love
Were certain to succeed
If our love song
Could fly over mountains
Sail over heartaches
Just like the films
If theres reason
To feel all the hard times
To lay down the hard lines
Its absolutely trueNo one can blame you for walking away
Too much rejection
No love injection
Life can be easy
Its not always swell
Dont tell me truth hurts little girl
Cause it hurts like hell
But down in the underground
Youll find someone true
Down in the underground
A land serene
A crystal moon ah ah
Its only forever
Not long at all
Lost and lonely
Thats underground
Underground

Watch the revolution
No more free steps to heaven
Just walkie-talkie
Heaven or hearth
Just big heads and drums full speed and pagan
And its no game
I am barred
From the event
I really dont understand the situation
So wheres the moral
People have their fingers broken
To be insulted by these fascists is so degrading
And its no game
Documentaries on refugees
Couples gainst the target
Throw a rock against the road
And it breaks into pieces
Draw the blinds on yesterday
And its all so much scarier
Put a bullet in my brain
And it makes all the papers
And its no game
Children round the world
Put camel shit on the walls
Theyre making carpets on treadmills
Or garbage sorting
And its no gameShe had an horror of rooms she was tired you cant hide beat
When I looked in her eyes they were blue but nobody home
She couldve been a killer if she didnt walk the way she do and she do
She opened strange doors that wed never close again
She began to wail jealousies scream
Waiting at the lights know what I mean
Scary monsters super creeps
Keep me running running scared
Scary monsters super creeps
Keep me running running scared
She asked me to stay and I stole her room
She asked for my love and I gave her a dangerous mind
Now shes stupid in the street and she cant socialise
Well I love the little girl and Ill love her till the day she dies
She wails
Jimmys guitar sound jealousies scream
Waiting at the lights know what I mean
Scary monsters super creeps
Keep me running running scared

And I wouldnt go to war
And I mixed with other colors
But the nurse doesnt care
And I hide under blankets
Or did I run away
I really cant remember
Last time I saw the light of day
But I remember Sam cause he was like me
Scream like a baby
Sam was a gun
And I never knew his last name
And we never had no fun
Well they came down hard on the faggots
And they came down hard on the street
They came down harder on Sam
And they all knew he was beat
He was thrown into the wagon
Blindfolded chains and they stomped on us
And took away our clothes and things
And pumped us full of strange drugs
And oh I saw Sam falling
Spitting in their eyes
But now I lay me down to sleep
And now I close my eyes
Now Im learning to be a part of socie-soc-soci-tsociety
Scream like a baby
Sam was a gun
And I never knew his last name
And we never had no fun
No athletic program no discipline no book
He just sat in the backseat swearing hed seek revenge
But he jumped into the furnace singing old songs we loved
Scream like a baby
Sam was a gun
And I never knew his last name
And we never had no fun
Scream like a baby
Sam was a gun
And I never knew his last name
And we never had no funWell I walked in the pouring rain
And I heard a voice that cries Its all in vain
The voice of doom was shining in my room
I just need one day somewhere far away
Lord I just need one day
Well Ive been breaking these rocks
And cutting this hay
Yes Ill be breaking these rocks
It was my price to pay
Oh the rivers so muddy but it may come clear
And I know too well whats keeping me here
Im just the slave of a burning ray
Oh give me the night I cant take another sight
Please please give me the night
Been breaking this rocks
And cutting this hay
Yes Ill be breaking these rocks
Whats my price to pay
Sun keeps beating down on me walls a mile high
Up in the tower theyre watching me hoping Im gonna die
I wont be breaking no rocks
I wont be breaking no rocks
I wont be breaking no rocks
I said I wont be breaking no rocks
I wont be breaking no rocks
Will pardon them I wont be breaking no rocks
Oh-oh-oh-oh
I wont be breaking no rocks
I wont be breaking no rocks

Come out to play
Little metal faced-boy
Dont stay away
Theyre so war-torn and resigned
She cant talk anymore
What are they trying to prove
What would they like to find
Its love back to front and no sides like I say
These pieces are broken like I say
These pieces are broken oh no no no no no
Because youre young
Youll meet a stranger some night
Because youre young
What could be nicer for you
And it makes me sad
So Ill dance my life away
A million dreams a million scars
He punishes hard
Was loving her such a crime
She took back everything she said
Left him nearly out of his mind
Theyre people I know people I love
They seem so unhappy
Dead or alive
Its love back to front and no sides like I say
These pieces are broken like I say
These pieces are broken oh no no no

With its promise of something hard to do
A real life adventure worth more than pieces of gold
Blue skies above and sun on your arms strength your stride
And hope in those squeaky clean eyes
Youll get chilly receptions everywhere you go
Blinded with desire I guess the season is on
So you train by shadow boxing search for the truth
But its all but its all used up
Break open your million dollar weapon
And push your luck still you push still you push your luck
A broken nosed mogul are you one of the new wave boys
Same old thing in brand new drag comes sweeping into view
As ugly as a teenage millionaire pretending its a whizz kid world
Youll take me aside and say
Well David what shall I do They wait for me in the hallway
Ill say dont ask me I dont know any hallways
But they move in numbers and theyve got me in a corner
I feel like a group of one no no they cant do this to me
Im not some piece of teenage wildlife
Those midwives to history put on their bloody robes
The word is that the hunted one is out there on his own
And youre alone for maybe the last time
And you breathe for a long time
Then you howl like a wolf in a trap
And you darent look behind
You fall to the ground like a leaf from the tree
And look up one time at that vast blue sky
Scream out aloud as they shoot you down
No no Im not a piece of teenage wildlife
Im not a piece of teenage wildlife
And no one will have seen and no one will confess
The fingerprints will prove that you coudnt pass the test
Therell be others on the line filing past wholl whisper low
I miss you he really had to go well each to his own he was
Another piece of teenage wildlife
Another piece of teenage wildlife another piece of teenage wild
Wild
Wild
Wild
The vacuum created by the arrival of freedom
And the possibilities it seems to offer
Its got nothing to do with you if one can grasp it
Its got nothing to do with you if one can grasp it
A series of shocks - sneakers fall apart
Earth keeps on rolling - witnesses falling
Its got nothing to do with you if one can grasp it
Its got nothing to do with you if one can grasp it
Yeah yeah yeah - up the hill backwards
Itll be alright ooh
While we sleep they go to work
Were legally crippled its the death of love
Its got nothing to do with you if one can grasp it
Its got nothing to do with you if one can grasp it
More idols then realities ooh

In such an early song
Ive heard a rumor from Ground Control
Oh no dont say its true
They got a message from the Action Man
Im happy hope youre happy too
Ive loved all Ive needed love
Sordid details following
The shrieking of nothing is killing just
Pictures of Jap girls in synthesis and I
Aint got no money and I aint got no hair
But Im hoping to kick but the planet its glowing
Ashes to ashes funk to funky
We know Major Toms a junkie
Strung out in heavens high
Hitting an all-time low
Time and again I tell myself
Ill stay clean tonight
But the little green wheels are following me
Oh no not again
Im stuck with a valuable friend
Im happy hope youre happy too
One flash of light but no smoking pistol
I never done good things I never done good things
I never done bad things I never done bad things
I never did anything out of the blue woh-o-oh
Want an axe to break the ice
Wanna come down right now
Ashes to ashes funk to funky
We know Major Toms a junkie
Strung out in heavens high
Hitting an all-time low

Youd better not mess with Major Tom

Whod have ever thought of it
Whod have ever dreamed
That a small town girl like you
Would be the boss of me
We fly through the night
The tears on your lips
Life has your mind and soul
It spins on your hips
Whod have ever thought of it
Whod have ever dreamed
Whod have ever thought of it
Whod have ever dreamed
That a small town girl like you
Would be the boss of me
Would be the boss of me
Would be the boss of me
You look at me and you reach for the free blue sky
I look to the stars as they flicker and float in your eyes
And under these wings of steel the small town dies

Whod have ever thought of it

Moving through the dark
Leaving slips of paper
Somewhere in the park
Hidden from your friends
Stealing all they knew
Love is thrown in airless rooms
Thin vile rewards for you
And Im gonna tell
Yes Ive gotta tell
Gotta tell the things youve said
When youre talking in the dark
And Im gonna tell the things youve done
When youre walking through the park
Some night on a thrill-less street
Will come a silent gun
Youve got a dangerous part
You stole their trust their moon their sun
Therell come such needle
On a crowded train
I bet youll feel so lonely you could die
Buildings crammed with people
Landscape filled with wrath
Grey concrete city
Rain has wet the street
I want to see you clearly
Before you close the door
A room of bloody history
You made sure of that
I can see you as a corpse
Hanging from a beam
I can read you like a book
I can feel you falling
I hear you moaning in your room
Oh see if I care
Oh please please make it soon
Walls have got you cornered
Youve got the blues my friend
And people dont like you
But you will leave without a sound
But you will leave without a land
Oh feeling so lonely
Death alone shall love you
I bet youll feel so lovely you could die
I feel so lonely you could die
You feel so lonely you could dieStars are never sleeping
Dead ones and the living
We live closer to the earth
Never to the heavens
The stars are never far away
Stars are out tonight
They watch us from behind their shades
Brigitte Jack and Kate and Brad
From behind their tinted window stretch
Gleaming like blackened sunshine
Stars are never sleeping
Dead ones and the living
Waiting for the first move
Satyrs and their child wives
Waiting for the last move
Soaking up our primitive world
Stars are never sleeping
Dead ones and the living
Their jealousys spilling down
The stars must stick together
We will never be rid of these stars
But I hope they live forever
And they know just what we do
That we toss and turn at night
Theyre waiting to make their moves
For the stars are out tonight
Here they are upon the stairs
Sexless and unaroused
They are the stars theyre dying for you
But I hope they live forever
They burn you with their radiant smiles
Trap you with their beautiful eyes
Theyre broke and shamed or drunk or scared
But I hope they live forever
Their jealousys spilling down
The stars must stick together
We will never be rid of these stars
But I hope they live forever
And they know just what we do
That we toss and turn at night
Theyre waiting to make their moves on us

Im gonna say goodbye he says yea
Do not cry she begs of him goodbye yea
All that day she thinks of his love yea
They whip him through the streets and alleys there
The gormless and the baying crowd right there
They cant get enough of that doomsday song
They cant get enough of it all
Listen
Listen to the whores he tells her
He fashions paper sculptures of them
Then drags them to the rivers bank in the cart
Their soggy paper bodies wash ashore in the dark
And the priest stiff in hate now demanding fun begin
Of his women dressed as men for the pleasure of that priest
Here I am
Not quite dying
My body left to rot in a hollow tree
Its branches throwing shadows
On the gallows for me
And the next day
And the next
And another day
Ignoring the pain of their particular diseases
They chase him through the alleys chase him down the steps
They haul him through the mud and they chant for his death
And drag him to the feet of the purple-headed priest
First they give you everything that you want
Then they take back everything that you have
They live upon their feet and they die upon their knees
They can work with satan while they dress like the saints
They know god exists for the devil told them so
They scream my name aloud down into the well below
Here I am
Not quite dying
My body left to rot in a hollow tree
Its branches throwing shadows
On the gallows for me
And the next day
And the next
And another day
Here I am
Not quite dying
My body left to rot in a hollow tree
Its branches throwing shadows
On the gallows for me
And the next day
And the next
And another day
Here I am
Not quite dying
My body left to rot in a hollow tree
Its branches throwing shadows
On the gallows for me
And the next day
And the next
And another dayMidnight in the Village

From Potsdamer Platz
You never knew that
That I could do that

Everybody drank a lot of something nice
There was an old fashioned band of married men
Looking up to me for encouragement it was so-so
The ladies looked bad but the music was sad
No one took their eyes off Lorraine
She shimmered and she strolled like a Chicago moll
Her feathers looked better and better it was so-so
Yeah it was time to unfreeze
When the reverend alabaster danced on his knees
Slam so it wasnt a game
Cracking all the mirrors in shame
Watch that man oh honey watch that man
He talks like a jerk but he could eat you with a fork and spoon
Watch that man oh honey watch that man
He walks like a jerk
But hes only taking care of the room
Must be in tune
A Benny Goodman fan painted holes in his hands
So shaky hung him up to dry
The pundits were hoking the manholes were smoking
And every bottle battled with the reason why
The girl on the phone wouldnt leave me alone
A throw back from someones LP
A lemon in a bag played the tiger rag
And the bodies on the screen stopped bleeding
Yeah I was shaking like a leaf
For I couldnt understand the conversation
Yeah I ran to the street looking for information
Watch that man oh honey watch that man
He talks like a jerk but he could eat you with a fork and spoon
Watch that man oh honey watch that man
He walks like a jerk
But hes only taking care of the room
Must be in tuneLittle wendy cocaine stumbles up the hill to pain
Nothing stops the go-to girl nothing takes the place of taking aim
Little wendys out there shaking hips and cuckoo eyes
Crazy drives that dizzy crowd
Moonlight strokes the highlights in her hair
She sells and moves and finds my hand
And pulls me down and close so I can hardly stand
As I lay like dead for her Im fed into my head Im led oh I am sam
Im crawling from the window crawling down the wall
Im happy screaming yes I am
Im jumping on her daisy chain
Im speeding through the dancehall like a rocket man
Now I wish today that yesterday was just tomorrow and
I could squeeze her grabby hand
Knowing that I never paid her for a gram
Shes a drunken doxy off her trolly
Sent before her time into this poxy world
Shes not fit for anything but dealing it
While heaven sings I have this girl
Shes got me eating rice and beans
I have no shape nor color Im gods lonely man
I dont want to die but I dont want to live
Im speeding like a rocket man
Like a rocket man
Like a rocket man
Like a rocket maIf you can see me I can see you
I could wear your new blue shoes
I should wear your old red dress
And walk to the crossroads
So take this knife
And meet me across the river
Just shoots and ladders and this is the kiss
American
From nowhere to nothing
And I go way back
Children swarm like thousands of bugs
Towards the lights the beacons above the hill
The stars to the West the South the North and to the East
Now you could say Ive got a gift of sorts
A fear of rear windows and swinging doors
A love of violence and dread of sighs
If you can see me I can see you
If you can see me I can see you
I have seen these bairns wave their fists at God
Swear to destroy the beasts stamping the ground
In their excitement for tomorrow
I could wear your new blue shoes
I should wear your old red dress
And walk to the crossroads
So take this knife
And meet me across the river
I will take your lands and all that lays beneath
The dust of cold flowers prison of dark of ashes
I will slaughter your kind who descend from belief
I am the spirit of greed a lord of theft
Ill burn all your books and the problems they make
If you can see me I can see you
If you can see meTheres a graveyard by the station
Where the girls wear nylon skirts and
Sandals
The boys ride their Riga ones
Upon the little hill
Such sadness and grief
The trees die standing
Thats where we made our trysts
And struggled with our guns
Would you still love me
If the clocks could go backwards
The girls would fill with blood and
The grass would be green again
Remember the dead
They were so great
Some of them
How does the grass grow
Blood blood blood
Where do the boys lie
Mud mud mud
How does the grass grow
Blood blood blood
But I lived a blind life
A white face in prison
But you made a life out of nothing
Now I ride my black horse
I miss you more
Than youll ever ever know
Waiting with my red eyes
And my stone heart
How does the grass grow
Blood blood blood
Where do the boys lie
Mud mud mud
How does the grass grow
Blood blood blood
I gaze in defeat
At the stars in the night
The light in my life burnt away
There will be no tomorrow
Then you sigh in your sleep
And meaning returns with the day
Where do the boys lie
Mud mud mud
How does the grass grow
Blood blood bloodShell come shell go
Shell lay belief on you
Skin sweet with musky odor
The lady from another grinning soul
Cologne shell wear
Silver and Americard
Shell drive a beetle car
And beat you down at cool Canasta
And when the clothes are strewn
Dont be afraid of the room
Touch the fullness of her breast
Feel the love of her caress
She will be your living end
Shell come shell go
Shell lay belief on you
But she wont stake her life on you
How can life become her point of view
And when the clothes are strewn
Dont be afraid of the room
Touch the fullness of her breast
Feel the love of her caress
She will be your living end
She will be your living end
She will be your living end
She will be your living end
She will be your livingUh uh ah Let me put my arms around your head
Dom do ah Gee its hot lets go to bed
Dont forget to turn on the light

Oh stay please stay please stay
You caught yourself a trick down
On Sunset and Vine
But since he pinned you baby
Youre a porcupine
You sold me illusions for a sack full of checks
Youve made a bad connection cause I just want your sexA small Jean Genie snuck off to the city
Strung out on lasers and slash-back blazers
Ate all your razors while pulling the waiters
Talking bout Monroe and walking on Snow White
New Yorks a go-go and everything tastes right
Poor little Greenie ooh-ooh
Keep her comin
The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
Hes outrageous he screams and he bawls Jean Genie
Jean Genie let yourself go whoah
Sits like a man but he smiles like a reptile
She love him she love him but just for a short while
Shell scratch in the sand wont let go his hand
He says hes a beautician and sells you nutrition
And keeps all your dead hair for making up underwear
Poor little Greenie ooh-ooh
The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
Hes outrageous he screams and he bawls Jean Genie
Jean Genie let yourself go whoah
Hes so simple-minded he cant drive his module
He bites on the neon and sleeps in a capsule
Loves to be loved loves to be loved
Oh Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
Hes outrageous he screams and he bawls Jean Genie
Jean Genie let yourself go whoah
Go
Go
The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
Hes outrageous he screams and he bawls Jean Genie
Jean Genie let yourself go whoah
Go go goBorn in a UFO
She was born in a UFO
I come to the glade and watch the saucer land
She glided through the mist in an a-line skirt
Booted her shoes like hooves in the dirt
Her clutch bag reflected the sun and steel
The fiftys movie so many squealed
Theres no direction home she pleads
She cornered me against the trees
I was home I thought my life could start
She was not like the other girls
I was born under a stone
We were born with a single voice
She was born in a UFO
Born in a UFO
My friends sit around at the end of town
With their heads in their hands in the cool twilight air
I can see by their eyes that theyre bitching sore
Id rather be dead than fool around here anymore
She was all courage geometric face
Electric skin plastic and lace
Silver hair trapezoid flanks
I was so in love with her lavender vest
She was not like the other girls
I was born under a stone
We were born with a single voice
She was born in a UFO
Like in outer space
Born in a UFO
She was born in a UFO
Born in a UFO
She was born in a UFOJacqui loves her work and her work is love
For there is no other
She says god has given me a job
Jacqui loves her work
There is no other
Jacquis aiming for the stars but landed on the clouds
There is no other
Sitting in her corner too afraid to run away
Like a slave without chains
The wonder turns to danger spring turns to winter
God bless the girl
But I will treasure treasure every single moment
God bless the girl
Fire turns to water light becomes darkness
God bless the girl
And I dont wanna hurt you just wanna have some fun
God bless the girl
God bless the girl
Yeah I dont wanna hurt you just wanna have some fun
God bless the girl
You dont need another friend you just need a reason
There is no other
Jacqui loves her work and her work is love
For there is no other
The wonder turns to danger spring turns to winter
God bless the girl
But I will always treasure treasure every single moment
God bless the girl
Fire turns to water and light becomes darkness
God bless the girl
I dont wanna hurt you just wanna have some fun
God bless the girl
God bless the girl
God bless the girl God bless the girl
I dont wanna hurt you just wanna have some fun
God bless the girl God bless the girl

God bless the girl God bless the girl
Years pass so swiftly
God bless the girl God bless the girl
God bless the girl God bless the girl
God bless the girl God bless the girl
God bless the girl God bless the girlIts the darkest hour youre twenty-two
The voice of youth the hour of dread
Its the darkest hour and your voice is new
Love is lost and lost is love
Your countrys new your friends are new
Your house and even your eyes are new
Your maid is new and your accent too
But your fear is as old as the world
Say goodbye to the thrills of life
When love was good when love was bad
Wave goodbye to the life without pain
Say hello your beautiful girl
Say hello to the greater men
Tell them your secrets theyre like the grave
Oh what have you done oh what have you done
Love is lost lost is love
You know so much its making you cry
You refuse to talk but you think like mad
Youve cut out your zone and the things have fold
Oh what have you done oh what have you done
Oh what have you done oh what have you doneWell dont you worry bout whats been on my mind

Lets spend the night together nowSomething like Tobacco Road
Living on a lonely road
I will pull you out of there
We will go to Finchley Fair
I will buy a feather hat
I will steal a cricket bat
Smash some windows make a noise
We will run with Dirty Boys
When the sun goes down
When the sun goes down and the die is cast
When the die is cast and you have no choice
We will run with Dirty Boys
We all want men we all want you
Me and the boys we all go through
Youve got to learn to hold your tongue
They said the moon was his burning sonCold fire youve got everything but cold fire
You will be my rest and peace child
I moved up to take a place
Near you
So tired its the sky that makes you feel tried
Its a trick to make you see wide
It can all but break your heat
In pieces
Staying back in your memory
Are the movies in the past
How you moved is all it takes
To sing a song of when I loved
The prettiest star
One day though it might as well be someday
You and I will rise up all the way
All because of what you are
The prettiest star
Staying back in your memory
Are the movies in the past
How you moved is all it takes
To sing a song of when I loved
The prettiest star
One day though it might as well be someday
You and I will rise up all the way
All because of what you are

Mission is dark
Trapped between the rocks
Blocking the waterfall
The songs of dust
The world would end
The night was always falling
The peacock in the snow
And I tell myself
I dont know who I am
And I tell myself
I dont know who I am
My father ran the prison
My father ran the prison
I can only love you
By hating him more
Thats not the truth
Its too big a word
He believed
That love is theft
Love and war
The theft of love
And I tell myself
I dont know who I am
And I tell myself
I dont know who I am
My father ran the prison
My father ran the prison
But I am a seer I am a liar
I am a seer but I am a liar
My father ran the prison

Feelings he treasured most of all
The teachers and the football stars
Its in his tiny face
Its in his scrawny hands
Valentine sold his soul
Hes got something to say
Its Valentines day
The rhythm of the crowd
Benny and Judy down
Valentine sees it all
Hes got something to say
Its Valentines day
Valentine told me how he feels
If all the world were under his heels
Or stumbling through the mall
Its in his tiny face
Its in his scrawny hands
Valentine knows it all
Hes got something to say
Its Valentines day

Its in his scrawny hands
Its in his icy heart
Its happening today
Valentine Valentine

Seeger lights the candles
From Bitter End to Gaslight
Baez leaves the stage
Ochs takes notes
When the black girl and guitar
Burn together hot in rage
Youve got what it takes
You say too much
Oh you will set the world babe
You will set the world on fire
I can work the scene and
I can see the magazines
I can hear the nation
I can hear the nation cry
You will set the world babe
You will set the world on fire
You will set it on fire
Kennedy would kill for the lines that youve written
Van Ronk says to Bobby shes the next real thing
Crouched in the half light screaming like a banshee
Youre in the boat babe were in the water
You say too much
Oh you will set the world babe
You will set the world on fire
I can work the scene and
I can see the magazines

I ride the train to the pick-up point
Ill be telling myself
There was no other way
That you brought it on yourself
Now my hearts aflame
At the end of your life
Its the end of your life
Ive got a pool of blood
On this bathroom floor
The mirrors broke
Theres a crack in the door
Theres a broken window
That Ill be crawling through
Then Ill change my life
And we wont have you
We wont have you
No we wont have you
Good or evil
Saint or whore
The mythical public
I dont recall
You were on the ledger
Your name was double crossed
You were a prime assignment
So help me Christ
Ive got major questions
About the Lord above
About Satan below
About the way we love
About the rule at the top
And the people coming up
And I still dont know
What we were looking for
But it wasnt you
No it wasnt you
No It wasnt youHe looked a lot like Che Guevara drove a diesel van
Kept his gun in quiet seclusion such a humble man
The only survivor of the National Peoples Gang
Panic in Detroit I asked for an autograph
He wanted to stay home I wish someone would phone
Panic in Detroit
He laughed at accidental sirens that broke the evening gloom
The police had warned of repercussions
They followed none too soon
A trickle of strangers were all that were left alive
Panic in Detroit I asked for an autograph
He wanted to stay home I wish someone would phone
Panic in Detroit
Putting on some clothes I made my way to school
And I found my teacher crouching in his overalls
I screamed and ran to smash my favorite slot machine
And jumped the silent cars that slept at traffic lights
Having scored a trillion dollars made a run back home
Found him slumped across the table a gun and me alone
I ran to the window looked for a plane or two
Panic in Detroit hed left me an autograph
Let me collect dust I wish someone would phone
Panic in Detroit
Panic in Detroit
Panic in DetroitCutting through the water
Hands upon the ghost
To the city of solid iron
Through the kingdom of the boats
Send your friend away now
Let him sail back home tonight
Something like religion
Dancing face to face
Something like a drowning
Dancing out in space
No-one here can see you
Dancing face to face
No-one here can beat you
Dancing out in space
Silent as Georges Rodenbach
Mist and silhouette
Girl you move like water
Youve got stars upon your head
Youve got my name and number
Youve got to take the floor
Something like religion
Dancing face to face
Something like a drowning
Dancing out in space
No-one here can see you
Dancing face to face
No-one here can beat you
Dancing out in space
Dancing face to face
Dancing out in space
Dancing face to face
Dancing out in space
Dancing face to face
Dancing out in spaceTime hes waiting in the wings
He speaks of senseless things
His script is you and me boys
Time he flexes like a whore
Falls wanking to the floor
His trick is you and me boy
Time in quaaludes and red wine
Demanding Billy Dolls
And other friends of mine
Take your time
The sniper in the brain regurgitating drain
Incestuous and vain
And many other last names
Oh well I look at my watch it say nine twenty-five
And I think oh God Im still alive
We should be on by now
We should be on by now
La la la la la la la la

You are not a victim
You just scream with boredom
You are not evicting time
Chimes goddamn youre looking old
Youll freeze and catch a cold
Cause youve left your coat behind
Take your time
Breaking up is hard but keeping dark is hateful
I had so many dreams
I had so many breakthroughs
But you my love were kind but love has left you dreamless
The door to dreams was closed
Your park was real dreamless
Perhaps youre smiling now
Smiling through this darkness
But all I had to give was guilt for dreaming
We should be on by now
We should be on by now
We should be on by now
We should be on by now
We should be on by now

Who suffers gloom
So slow
Eyes were stolen
For her
A sleeping sky
Takes the moon
So slow
I would slide away
Further out to sea
Further out to sea
So she
She saw me smile
Feeling like
Id never been
She saw me smile
Feeling like Id never been
In love
Feeling like Id never been
The only one and all alone
The only one and all aloneIts safe in the city to love in a doorway
To wrangle some screens from the door
And isnt it me putting pain in a stranger
Like a portrait in flesh who trails on a leash
Will you see that Im scared and Im lonely
So Ill break up my room and yawn and I
Run to the center of things
Where the knowing one says
Chorus
Boys boys its a sweet thing
Boys boys its a sweet thing sweet thing
If you want it boys get it here thing
Cause hope boys is a cheap thing cheap
Thing
Im glad that youre older than me
Makes me feel important and free

If his trade is a curse then Ill bless you
And turn to the crossroads and hamburgers and

Hell build a glass asylum
With just a hint of mayhem
Hell build a better whirlpool

As the last few corpses lay rotting on the slimy
Thoroughfare
The shutters lifted in inches in Temperance Building
High on Poachers Hill
And red mutant eyes gaze down on Hunger City
No more big wheels
Fleas the size of rats sucked on rats the size of cats
And ten thousand peoploids split into small tribes
Coveting the highest of the sterile skyscrapers
Like packs of dogs assaulting the glass fronts of Love-Me Avenue
Ripping and rewrapping mink and shiny silver fox now leg-warmers
Family badge of sapphire and cracked emerald
Any day now
The year of the Diamond Dogs

As they pulled you out of the oxygen tent
You asked for the latest party
With your silicone hump and your ten inch stump
Dressed like a priest you was
Todd Brownings freak you was
Crawling down the alley on your hands and knee
Im sure youre not protected for its plain to see
The diamond dogs are poachers and they hide behind trees
Hunt you to the ground they will mannequins with kill appeal
Will they come
Ill keep a friend serene
Will they come
Oh baby come unto me
Will they come
Well shes come been and gone
Come out of the garden baby
Youll catch your death in the fog
Young girl they call them the Diamond Dogs
Young girl they call them the Diamond Dogs
The Halloween Jack is a real cool cat
And he lives on top of Manhattan Chase
The elevators broke so he slides down a rope
Onto the street below oh Tarzie go man go
Meet his little hussy with his ghost town approach
Her face is sans feature but she wears a Dali brooch
Sweetly reminiscent something mother used to bake
Wrecked up and paralyzed Diamond Dogs are stabilized
Will they come
Ill keep a friend serene
Will they come
Oh baby come unto me
Will they come
Well shes come been and gone
Come out of the garden baby
Youll catch your death in the fog
Young girl they call them the Diamond Dogs
Young girl they call them the Diamond Dogs
Oo-oo-ooh call them the Diamond Dogs
Oo-oo-ooh call them the Diamond Dogs
In the year of the scavenger the season of the bitch
Sashay on the boardwalk scurry to the ditch
Just another future song lonely little kitsch
Theres gonna be sorrow try and wake up tomorrow
Will they come
Ill keep a friend serene
Will they come
Oh baby come unto me
Will they come
Well shes come been and gone
Come out of the garden baby
Youll catch your death in the fog
Young girl they call them the Diamond Dogs
Young girl they call them the Diamond Dogs
Oo-oo-ooh call them the Diamond Dogs
Oo-oo-ooh call them the Diamond Dogs
Bow-wow woof woof bow-wow wow
Call them the Diamond Dogs
Dogs
Call them the Diamond Dogs call them call them
Call them the Diamond Dogs call them call them ooo
Call them the Diamond Dogs
Keep cool
Diamond Dogs rule ok
Hey-hey-hey-hey
Beware of the Diamond Dogs
Beware of the Diamond Dogs
Beware of the Diamond DogsIll make you a deal like any other candidate
Well pretend were walking home cause your futures at stake
My set is amazing it even smells like a street
Theres a bar at the end
Where I can meet you and your friend
Someone scrawled on the wall I smell the blood of les tricoteuses
Who wrote up scandals in other bars
Im having so much fun with the poisonous people
Spreading rumors and lies and stories they made up
Some make you sing and some make you scream
One makes you wish that youd never been seen
But theres a shop on the corner thats selling papier mache
Making bullet-proof faces Charlie Manson Cassius Clay
If you want it boys get it here thing
So you scream out of line
I want you I need you Anyone out there Any time
Tres butch little number whines Hey dirty I want you
When its good its really good and when its bad I go to pieces
If you want it boys get it here thing
Well on the street where you live I could not hold up my head
For I put all I have in another bed
On another floor in the back of a car
In the cellar like a church with the door ajar
Well I guess weve must be looking for a different kind
But we cant stop trying till we break up our minds
Til the sun drips blood on the seedy young knights
Who press you on the ground while shaking in fright
I guess we could cruise down one more time
With you by my side it should be fine
Well buy some drugs and watch a band
Then jump in the river holding handsYou always were the one that knew
They sold us for the likes of you
I always wanted new surroundings
A room to rent while the lizards lay crying in the heat
Trying to remember who to meet
I would take a foxy kind of stand
While tens of thousands found me in demand
CHORUS
When you rock n roll with me
No one else Id rather be
Nobody here can do it for me
Im in tears again
When you rock n roll with me
Gentle hearts are counted down
The queue is out of sight and out of sounds
Me Im out of breath but not quite doubting
Ive found a door which lets me outSomething kind of hit me today
I looked at you and wondered if you saw things my way
People will hold us to blame
It hit me today it hit me today
Were taking it hard all the time
Why dont we pass it by
Just reply youve changed your mind
Were fighting with the eyes of the blind
Taking it hard taking it hard
Yet now
We feel that we are paper choking on you nightly
They tell me Son we want you be elusive but dont walk far
For were breaking in the new boys deceive your next of kin
For youre dancing where the dogs decay defecating ecstasy
Youre just an ally of the leecher
Locator for the virgin King but I love you in your fuck-me pumps
And your nimble dress that trails
Oh dress yourself my urchin one for I hear them on the rails
Because of all weve seen because of all weve said
We are the dead
One thing kind of touched me today
I looked at you and counted all the times we had laid
Pressing our love through the night
Knowing its right knowing its right
Now Im hoping some one will care
Living on the breath of a hope to be shared
Trusting on the sons of our love
That someone will care someone will care
But now
Were todays scrambled creatures locked in tomorrows double feature
Heavens on the pillow its silence competes with hell
Its a twenty-four hour service guaranteed to make you tell
And the streets are full of press men
Bent on getting hung and buried
And the legendary curtains are drawn round Baby Bankrupt
Who sucks you while youre sleeping
Its the theater of financiers
Count them fifty round a table
White and dressed to kill
Oh caress yourself my juicy
For my hands have all but withered
Oh dress yourself my urchin one for I hear them on the stairs
Because of all weve seen because of all weve said
We are the dead
We are the dead
We are the deadHey it aint over
Me I hope that Im crazy
I feel you driving and youre only the wheel
Slow down let someone love you
Oh Ive never touched you since I started to feel
If theres nothing to hide me
Then youve never seen me hanging naked and wired
Somebody lied I say its hip
To be alive
Now your smile is spreading thin
Seems youre trying not to lose
Since Im not supposed to win
All youve got to do is win
Thats all you gotta do ooh it aint over
Me Im fresh on your pages
Secret thinker sometimes listening aloud
Life lies dumb on its heroes
Wear your wound with honor make someone proud
Someone like you should not be allowed
To start any fires
Now your smile is spreading thin
Seems youre trying not to lose
Since Im not supposed to win
All youve got to do is win
Thats all you gotta do ooh it aint over
Now your smile is spreading thin
Seems youre trying not to lose
Since Im not supposed to win
All youve got to do is win
Thats all you gotta do all you got to do is win

They slither wildly as they slip away across the universe
Pools of sorrow waves of joy
Are drifting through my opened mind
Possessing and caressing me
Nothings gonna change my world
Nothings gonna change my world
Nothings gonna change my world
Nothings gonna change my world
Images of broken light
Which dance before me like a million eyes
They call me on and on across the universe
Thoughts meander like a restless wind inside a letter box
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe
Nothings gonna change my world
Nothings gonna change my world
Nothings gonna change my world
Nothings gonna change my world
Sounds of laughter shades of life
Are ringing through my opened ears
Inciting and inviting me
Limitless undying love
Which shines around me like a million suns
It calls me on and on across the universe
Nothings gonna change my world
Nothings gonna change my world
Nothings gonna change my world

Misses a step and cuts his hand but
Showing nothing he swoops like a song
She cries where have all Papas heroes gone

Nothing we cant shake

With nothing much at stake
As long as youre still smiling
Theres nothing more I need
I absolutely love you
But were absolute beginners
But if my love is your love
Were certain to succeed
If our love song
Could fly over mountains
Sail over heartaches
Just like the films
If theres reason
To feel all the hard times
To lay down the hard lines

Velvet GoldmineOnce she had drowned and started her slow descent
Down the streams to where the great rivers broaden
Oh the open sky chant most magnificent
As if it was acting as her bodys guardian
Wreck and duck weed slowly increased her weight
By clasping her in their slimy grip
Through her limbs the cold blooded fishes played
Creatures and plant life kept on thus obstructing her last trip
And the sky that same evening grew dark as smoke
And its stars through the night kept the brightness still soaring
But it quickly grew clear when dawn now broke
To see that she got one further morning
Once her pallid trunk had rotted beyond repair
It happened quite slowly that she gently slipped from Gods thoughts
First with her face then her hands right at the last with her hair
Leaving those corpse-choked rivers just one more corpseYoure like a sailor with a girl on every shore
Stay with them now for they wont see you any more
Like a gypsy forever on the run
Stay for a while while ya look for a whore
Like that sailor leaves come back again
Stay for a while and they wont see you again
Like that gypsy caravan forever on the run
Ya stay for a while then you pick up and go
Thats how you show
Your love for me
Thats how you show
Your love for me

Givin everyone to console their aching heart
Like that snow that fell looks so wrong and out of place
Stay for a while then you leave without a trace
Thats xactly like that star he tore the town apart
Leave everyone to console their aching heart
Like that snow that fell looks so wrong and out of place
Stay for a while leave without a trace
Thats how you show
Your love for me
Thats how you show
Your love for me

Shala la la la
A little piece of you
The little peace in me
Will die
For this is not America
Blossom fails to bloom this season
Promise not to stare
Too long
For this is not a miracle
There was a time
A storm that blew so pure
For this could be the biggest sky
And I could have the faintest idea
For this is not America
This is not America
This is not
Snowman melting from the inside
Falcon spirals
To the ground
So bloody red tomorrows clouds
A little piece of you
The little piece in me
Will die
For this is not America
There was a time
A wind that blew so young
For this could be the biggest sky
And I could have the faintest idea
For this is not America
This is not America
This is not
This is not America
This is not
This is not America
This is notAh ah ah ah

I can stare for a thousand years
Colder than the moon
Well its been so long
And Ive been putting out the fire with gasoline
See these eyes so red
Red like jungle burning bright
Those who feel me near
Pull the blinds and change their minds
Its been so long
Still this pulsing night
A plague I call a heartbeat
Just be still with me
But it wouldnt believe what Ive been through
Youve been so long
Well its been so long
Ive been putting out the fire with gasoline
Putting out the fire
With gasoline
See these tears so blue
An ageless heart that can never mend
Tears can never dry
A judgment made can never bend
See these eyes so green
I can stare for a thousand years
Just be still with me
You wouldnt believe what Ive been through
Well youve been so long

And Ive been putting out fire with gasoline

Made in a bar at the railway station
And theres a story a kind of fable
On a card at the corner table
On it is a message been there some time
It starts of The coffee tasted so fine
It says One day this may find you
These few words may remind you
We sat here together just to pass time
You said how the coffee tasted so fine
It goes on to say I love you
If you should find this I must hear from you
It gives a number but the name has faded away
All that is left are just the words Maybe someday
Thats the story and the fable
Never leave alone from a corner table

Pressure pushing down on me
Pressing down on you no man ask for
Under pressure that brings a building down
Splits a family in two
Puts people on streets
Um ba ba be
Um ba ba be

Ee day da thats okay
Its the terror of knowing
What the world is about
Watching some good friends
Screaming Let me out
Pray tomorrow gets me higher
Pressure on people people on streets

Pressure on people people on streets
Turned away from it all like a blind man
Sat on a fence but it dont work
Keep coming up with love but its so slashed and torn
Why why why
Love love love love love
Insanity laughs under pressure were breaking
Cant we give ourselves one more chance
Why cant we give love that one more chance
Why cant we give love give love give love give love
Give love give love give love give love give love
Cause loves such an old fashioned word
And love dares you to care for
The people on the People on streets edge of the night
And loves People on streets dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves
This is our last dance
This is ourselves
Under pressure

Oh oh oh little China girl
I could escape this feeling with my China girl
I feel a wreck without my little China girl
I hear her heart beating loud as thunder
Saw they stars crashing
Im a mess without my little China girl
Wake up mornings wheres my little China girl
I hear her hearts beating loud as thunder
Saw they stars crashing down
I feel a-tragic like Im Marlon Brando
When I look at my China girl
I could pretend that nothing really meant too much
When I look at my China girl
I stumble into town just like a sacred cow
Visions of swastikas in my head
Plans for everyone
Its in the whites of my eyes
My little China girl
You shouldnt mess with me
Ill ruin everything you are
You know Ill give you television
Ill give you eyes of blue
Ill give you mens who want to rule the world
And when I get excited
My little China girl says
Oh baby just you shut your mouth
She says sh-sh-shhh

Just wishing that I had just something you wore
I put it on when I go lonely
Will you take off your dress and send it to me
I miss your kissin and I miss your head
And a letter in your writing doesnt mean youre not dead
Run outside in the desert heat
Make your dress all wet and send it to me
I miss your soup and I miss your bread
And a letter in your writing doesnt mean youre not dead
So spill your breakfast and drip your wine
Just wear that dress when youre die
D-A-V-I-D
Sitting here wishing on a cement floor
Just wishing that I had just something you wore
Bloody your hands on a cactus tree
Wipe it on your dress and send it to me
Sitting here wishing on a cement floor
Just wishing that I had just something you woreFor were living in a safety zone
Dont be holding back from me
Were living from hour to hour down here
And well take it when we can
Its a kind of living which recognizes
The death of the odourless man
When nothing is vanity nothings too slow
Its not Eden but its no sham
There is no hell
There is no shame
There is no hell
Like an old hell
There is no hell
And its lights up boys
Lights up boys
Explosion falls upon deaf ears
While were swimming in a sea of sham
Living in the shadow of vanity
A complex fashion for a simple man
And there is no hell
And there is no shame
And there is no hell
Like an old hell
There is no hell
And the silence flies on its brief flight
A razor sharp crap shoot affair
And we light up our lives
And theres no more of me exploding you
Re-exposing you
Like everybody do
Re-exploding you
I dont know what to use
Make somebody move
Me exploding
Me exploding youNothing remains
We could run
When the rain slows
Look for the cars or signs of life
Where the heat goes
Look for the drifters
We should crawl under the bracken
Look for the shafts of light on the road
Where the heat goes
Everything has changed
For in truth its the beginning of nothing
And nothing has changed
Everything has changed
For in truth its the beginning of an end
And nothing has changed
And everything has changed
In your fear
Of what we have become
Take to the fire
Now we must burn
All that we are
Rise together
Through these clouds
As on wings
In your fear seek only peace
In you fear seek only love
In your fear seek only peace
In you fear seek only love
In your fear in your fear
As on wings
This is the trip
And this is the business we take
This is our number
All my trials Lord
Will be remembered
Everything has changedCalling Sister Midnight
Youve got me reaching for the moon
Calling Sister Midnight
Youve got me playing the fool
Calling Sister Midnight
Calling Sister Midnight
Can you hear me call

Calling Sister Midnight
Im an Idiot for you
Calling Sister Midnight
Im a breakage inside
Calling Sister Midnight
Calling Sister Midnight
You know I had a dream last night
Mother was in my bed
And I made love to her
Father he gunned for me
Hunted me with his six gun
Calling Sister Midnight
What can I do about my dreams
Listen to me Sister Midnight
You put a beggar in my heart
Calling Sister Midnight
Youve got me walking in rags
Hey where are you Sister Midnight
Can you hear me call
Can you hear me well
Can you hear me at allMy my the time do fly
When its in another pair of hands
And a loser I will be
For Ive never been a winner in my life
I got used to stressing pain
I used the sucker pills to pity for the self
Oh its the animal in me
But Id rather be a beggarman on the shelf
Dont be so forlorn its just the payoff
Its the rain before the storm
On a better day Ill take you by the hand
And Ill walk you through the doors
Dont be so forlorn its just the payoff
Its the rain before the storm
Dont you let my letter get you down
Dont you dont you dont you dont you
My my but time do fly
When its in another pair of pants
And illusion I will be
For Ive never been a sinner la di da
Dont be so forlorn its just the payoff
Its the rain before the storm
Dont you let my letter get you down
Dont you dont you dont you dont you
Dont you let my letter get you down down down down
Dont you dont you dont you dont you
Dont you let my letter get you down down down down
Dont you dont you dont you dont you
Down down down down down down
Down down down down down down
Down down down down down downI wish I was smarter
I got so lost on the shore
I wish I was taller
Things really matter to me
But I put my face in tomorrow
I believe were not alone
I believe in Beatles
I believe my little soul has grown
And Im still so afraid
Yes Im still so afraid
Yea Im still so afraid on my own
On my own
What made my life so wonderful
What made me feel so bad
I used to wake up the ocean
I used to walk on clouds
If I put faith in medication
If I can smile a crooked smile
If I can talk on television
If I can walk an empty mile
Then I wont feel afraid
No I wont feel afraid
I wont be Be afraid
Anymore
Anymore
AnymoreBaby I dream between the blade and the tongue
Of the rose on your cheek the wounded and dumb
We stumble and fall we stumble and fall
Skin on skin but theres heaven in
Heavens in here
Heavens in here
Among the twilight and stars
Like a rocket to Mars
Heaven in here
The first and the last are telling it all
Telling you loud but selling it small
Im taking a swing at this shadow of mine
Crucifix hangs and my hearts in my mouth but its here
Heavens in here
Heavens in here
Among the twilight and stars
Like a rocket to Mars
Heaven in here
Heaven in one sigh heaven in two eyes
Heaven lies between your marbled thighs
The rustle of your falling gown
We stumble and fall like tragedy falls
We stumble and twirl theres heaven in here
We stumble and fall uncertain we fall
Flesh on flesh but theres heaven in
Heavens in here
Heavens in here
Heavens in here
Among the twilight and stars
Like a rocket to Mars
Heaven in here
Youll dance to my tongue
Well dance on the sun
Were the twilight and stars
Theres heaven in hereHallo Spaceboy youre sleepy now second time Hallo
Your silhouette is so stationary
Youre released but your custody calls
And I want to be free
Dont you want to be free
Do you like girls or boys
Its confusing these days
But Moondust will cover you
Cover you
This chaos is killing me
Chorus
So bye bye love

Moondust will cover youOogie waits for just another day
Drags his bones
To see the Yankees play
Bones Boy talks and flickers gray
Oh they slip away
Once a time
They nearly might have been
Bones and Oogie on a silver screen
No one knew what they could do
Except for me and you
They slip away
They slip away
Dont forget
To keep your head warm
Twinkle twinkle Uncle Floyd
Watching all the world
And war torn
How I wonder where you are
Oo-o
Sailing over
Coney Island
Twinkle twinkle Uncle Floyd
We were dumb
But you were fun boy
How I wonder where you are
Oo-o
Oogie knew theres never ever time
Some of us will always stay behind
Down in space its always one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-two
The joke we always knew
Oo-oo
Whatsa matter with you
Cmon lets go
Slip away
Oo-oEmily tries but misunderstands
Shes often inclined to borrow somebodys dreams till tomorrow
There is no other day
Lets try it another way
Youll lose your mind and play
Free games for May
See Emily play
Soon after dark Emily cries
Gazing at trees in sorrow hardly a sound till tomorrow
There is no other day
Lets try it another way
Youll lose your mind and play
Free games for May
See Emily play
Put on a gown that touches the ground
Float on a river for ever and ever
Emily
There is no other day
Lets try it another way
Youll lose your mind and play
Free games for May
See Emily playNew feeling inside
Its a hot certain kind
I feel hot and cold
Down my soul baby
I cant explain
Going out of my mind
Dizzy in the head and Im feeling blue
Things you say well maybe theyre true
I get funny dreams again and again
Knows what it means but
Cant explain
I think its love
Say it to you
When I feel blue
I cant explain no I cant explain
You know I cant explain
Im going out of my mind
Well Im a worried guy
But I cant explainHe looked a lot like Che Guevara drove a diesel van
Kept his gun in quiet seclusion such a humble man
The only survivor of the National Peoples Gang
Panic in Detroit I asked for an autograph
He wanted to stay home I wish someone would phone
Panic in Detroit
He laughed at accidental sirens that broke the evening gloom
The police had warned of repercussions
They followed none too soon
A trickle of strangers were all that were left alive
Panic in Detroit I asked for an autograph
He wanted to stay home I wish someone would phone
Panic in Detroit
Putting on some clothes I made my way to school
And I found my teacher crouching in his overalls
I screamed and ran to smash my favorite slot machine
And jumped the silent cars that slept at traffic lights
Having scored a trillion dollars made a run back home
Found him slumped across the table a gun and me alone
I ran to the window looked for a plane or two
Panic in Detroit hed left me an autograph
Let me collect dust I wish someone would phone
Panic in Detroit
Panic in Detroit
Panic in DetroitCold fire youve got everything but cold fire
You will be my rest and peace child
I moved up to take a place
Near you
So tired its the sky that makes you feel tried
Its a trick to make you see wide
It can all but break your heat
In pieces
Staying back in your memory
Are the movies in the past
How you moved is all it takes
To sing a song of when I loved
The prettiest star
One day though it might as well be someday
You and I will rise up all the way
All because of what you are
The prettiest star
Staying back in your memory
Are the movies in the past
How you moved is all it takes
To sing a song of when I loved
The prettiest star
One day though it might as well be someday
You and I will rise up all the way
All because of what you are
The prettiest starUh uh ah Let me put my arms around your head
Dom do ah Gee its hot lets go to bed
Dont forget to turn on the light
Dont laugh babe itll be alright
Dom do ah Pour me out another phone
Dom do ah Ill ring and see if your friends are home
Perhaps the strange ones in the dome

Bah dom bah cursing at the astronette

Once we had an easy ride
And always felt the same
Time was on our side
And I had everything to gain
Let it be like yesterday
Please let me have happy days
Ma and Pa looked back on all the things they used to do
Didnt have no money and they always told the truth
Daddy didnt have no toys
And Mummy didnt need no boys
CHORUS
Yesterday was such an easy game for you to play
But lets face it things are so much easier today
Guess you need some bringing down
Get your feet back on the ground
CHORUSOhhhhhhere it comes

His arms around her like it used to be with me
Oh it makes me want to die
Yeah here it comes
Here comes the night
Yeah here comes the night here comes the night
Yeahhere comes the night
There they go funny how they look so good together
Wonder what is wrong with me

On Sunset and Vine
But since he pinned you baby
Youre a porcupine
You sold me illusions for a sack full of checks
Youve made a bad connection cause I just want your sexShapes of things before my eyes
Just teach me to despise
Will time make man more wise
Here within my lonely frame
My eyes just hurt my brain
But will it seem the same
Chorus
Come tomorrow will I be older
Come tomorrow maybe a soldier
Come tomorrow may I be bolder than today
Now the trees are almost green
But will they still be seen
When time and tide have been

Now I need you more than ever
Lets spend the night together
Now I need you more than ever
Lets spend the night together
They said we were too young
Our kind of love was no fun
But our love comes from above
Do it
Lets make love
Hoo
Lets spend the night together
Now I need you more than ever
Lets spend the night together nowTime hes waiting in the wings
He speaks of senseless things
His script is you and me boys
Time he flexes like a whore
Falls wanking to the floor
His trick is you and me boy
Time in quaaludes and red wine
Demanding Billy Dolls
And other friends of mine
Take your time
The sniper in the brain regurgitating drain
Incestuous and vain
And many other last names
Oh well I look at my watch it say nine twenty-five
And I think oh God Im still alive
We should be on by now
We should be on by now
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la

You are not a victim
You just scream with boredom
You are not evicting time
Chimes goddamn youre looking old
Youll freeze and catch a cold
Cause youve left your coat behind
Take your time
Breaking up is hard but keeping dark is hateful
I had so many dreams
I had so many breakthroughs
But you my love were kind but love has left you dreamless
The door to dreams was closed
Your park was real dreamless
Perhaps youre smiling now
Smiling through this darkness
But all I had to give was guilt for dreaming
We should be on by now
We should be on by now
We should be on by now
We should be on by now
We should be on by now

Shell lay belief on you
Skin sweet with musky oil
The lady from another grinning soul
Cologne shell wear
Silver and Americard
Shell drive a beetle car
And beat you down at cool Canasta
And when the clothes are strewn
Dont be afraid of the room
Touch the fullness of her breast
Feel the love of her caress
She will be your living end
Shell come shell go
Shell lay belief on you
But she wont stake her life on you
How can life become her point of view
And when the clothes are strewn
Dont be afraid of the room
Touch the fullness of her breast
Feel the love of her caress
She will be your living end
She will be your living end
She will be your living end
She will be your living end
She will be your livingHey Rosalyn tell me where youve been

Everybody drank a lot of something nice
There was an old fashioned band of married men
Looking up to me for encouragement it was so-so
The ladies looked bad but the music was sad
No one took their eyes off Lorraine
She shimmered and she strolled like a Chicago moll
Her feathers looked better and better it was so-so
Yeah it was time to unfreeze
When the reverend alabaster danced on his knees
Slam so it wasnt a game
Cracking all the mirrors in shame
Watch that man oh honey watch that man
He talks like a jerk but he could eat you with a fork and spoon
Watch that man oh honey watch that man
He walks like a jerk
But hes only taking care of the room
Must be in tune
A Benny Goodman fan painted holes in his hands
So shaky hung him up to dry
The pundits were hoking the manholes were smoking
And every bottle battled with the reason why
The girl on the phone wouldnt leave me alone
A throw back from someones LP
A lemon in a bag played the tiger rag
And the bodies on the screen stopped bleeding
Yeah I was shaking like a leaf
For I couldnt understand the conversation
Yeah I ran to the street looking for information
Watch that man oh honey watch that man
He talks like a jerk but he could eat you with a fork and spoon
Watch that man oh honey watch that man
He walks like a jerk
But hes only taking care of the room
Must be in tuneI can go anyway way I choose
I can live anyhow win or lose
I can go anywhere for something new
Anyway anyhow anywhere I choose
I can do anything right or wrong
I can talk anyhow and get along
I dont care anyway I never lose
Anyway anyhow anywhere I choose
Nothing gets in my way
Not even locked doors
Dont follow the lines that been laid before
I get along anyway I care
Anyway anyhow anywhere
I can go anyway way I choose
I can live anyhow win or lose
I can go anywhere for something new
Anyway anyhow anywhere I chooseMonday mornin feels so bad

Monday Ill have Friday on my mindA small Jean Genie snuck off to the city
Strung out on lasers and slash-back blazers
Ate all your razors while pulling the waiters
Talking bout Monroe and walking on Snow White
New Yorks a go-go and everything tastes right
Poor little Greenie ooh-ooh
Keep her comin
The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
Hes outrageous he screams and he bawls Jean Genie
Jean Genie let yourself go whoah
Sits like a man but he smiles like a reptile
She love him she love him but just for a short while
Shell scratch in the sand wont let go his hand
He says hes a beautician and sells you nutrition
And keeps all your dead hair for making up underwear
Poor little Greenie ooh-ooh
The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
Hes outrageous he screams and he bawls Jean Genie
Jean Genie let yourself go whoah
Hes so simple-minded he cant drive his module
He bites on the neon and sleeps in a capsule
Loves to be loved loves to be loved
Oh Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
Hes outrageous he screams and he bawls Jean Genie
Jean Genie let yourself go whoah
Go
Go
The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
Hes outrageous he screams and he bawls Jean Genie
Jean Genie let yourself go whoah
Go go goIm on my own nowhere to roam
I tell you baby dont want no home
I wander round feet off the ground
I even go from town to town
I said I think this rock is grand
Say Ill be your man
Dont bring me down dont bring me down
I met this chick the other day
And then to me she said shell stay
I get this pad just like a cave
And then well have our living made
And then Ill lead her on the ground
My head is spinning round
Dont bring me down dont bring me down
I I I I I need a lover cause someone new
And then to her I will be true
Ill buy her furs and pretty things
Ill even buy a wedding ring
But until then Ill settle down
Say Ill be your man
Dont bring me down dont bring me down
Until then Ill settle down
Say Ill be your man
Dont bring me down dont bring me down
Dont bring me downThe ghost of Manhattoes

Goodbye Mr Ed Andys skull enshrined
In a shopping mall near Queens
Someone sees it all
Icarus takes his pratfall
Bruegel on his head
Goodbye Mr Ed
Four and twenty black kids
Some of them are blind
Someone sees it all
Tolerance of violence
By the fellows with no heads
Goodbye Mr Ed

They make no sense
Histories so small
People are so dense

From the spics and blacks and the gum you chew
Where the posters are torn by the muggin gangs
By the faggy parks and the burnt out vans
Ive got ninety-nine years of laying in the dark and Im far too young to lie
Ive got ninety-nine ways to play my guitar its going to pay me before I die
CHORUS
So bob your sweet head
Brother Ziggy going to play
Im just about the best you can hear
Gonna rock it in your head
Shazam and come ball
With my guitar and me soprano
We can give you sweet head
Im tough as glass and clean as night
Well if looks can love we can love all right
Im your rubber peacock angelic whore
Im a wrought iron face upon the wall
I had ninety-nine years of murder called life and Im running away from it all
I got a bedroom every mirror in town theyre going to claim me if I fall
CHORUS
Sweet head give you sweet head
spoken while ya down there
See my eyes of blocked emotion see my tremble see my fall
Traumatics thick and fast your faith in me can last
Besides Im known to lay you one and all
Look south the way your mother dwells
If she knew whats going down shed give you hell
Im the kind of man she warned me of
Till there was rock you only had god
You and I have a mutual vow
We both like young and we both like loud
I got pretty shoes and Im kid and proud
Im street side out with my ear to the crowd

They kiss come and they go
Like breeze brushing my cheek
Like pain like the tears on my face
Girls they come and they go
Like spirits they vanish at dawn
My heart suspended in time
Like you vanish like tears in the rain
Girls they take their loves away
Like spirits living so far away
Girls pretending to break down and cry
Girls whispering wind
What are they giving away
We used to be so happy
Remember remember so happy
I never knew how lonely
How lonely how lonely I could feel
Girls they come and they go
They kiss they come and they go
Like spirits brushing my cheek
Like pain like the tears on my face
Girls they take their loves away
Like spirits living so far away
Girls pretending to break down and cry
Girls whispering wind
What are they giving away
We used to be so happy
Remember remember so happy
I never knew how lonely
How lonely how lonely I could feel
GirlsRamona is so cold
When she broke it off with Leon
She said The ring is enough
I dont wanna see his face again
Ramona was so coldWhat to do

What to wear on a sunny day
Who to phone
Who to fight
Who to dance with on a Sunday night
Reaching the very edge you know
Reaching the very edge
Going to the other side this time
Reaching the very edge
CHORUS
Youre still breathing but you dont know why
Lifes a bit and sometimes you die
Youre still breathing but you just cant tell
Dont hold your breath but the pretty things are going to hell
I am a drug
I am a dragon
I am the best jazz youve ever seen
I am a dragon
I am the sky
I am the blood at the corner of your eye
I found the secrets I found gold
I find you out before you grow old
I find you out before you grow old
What is eternal
What is damned
What is clay and what is sand
Who to dis
Who to truss
Who to listen to
Who to suss
Im reaching the very edge you know
Im reaching the very edge
Im going to the other side this time
Im reaching the very edge
CHORUS
I am a dragon

The pretty things are going to hell
They wore it out but they wore it well
Youre still breathing but you dont know why
Youre still breathing but you just cant tell
Dont hold your breath but the pretty things are going to hellThe hand that wrote this letter
Sweeps the pillow clean
So rest your head and read a treasured dream
I care for no one else but you
I tear my soul to cease the pain
I think maybe you feel the same
What can we do
Im not quite sure what were supposed to do
So Ive been writing just for you
They say your life is going very well
They say you sparkle like a different girl
But something tells me that you hide
When all the world is warm and tired
You cry a little in the dark
Well so do I
Im not quite sure what youre supposed to say
But I can see its not okay
He makes you laugh
He brings you out in style
He treats you well
And makes you up real fine
And when hes strong
Hes strong for you
And when you kiss
Its something new
But did you ever call my name
Just by mistake
Im not quite sure what Im supposed to do
So Ill just write some love to youYou think youre gonna please her so you walk right up and tease her
But she walks right on by
Youre scared to walk beside her cause youre playing with the spider who possess the sky
She got the green backs my oh my
You gotta act tall think big if you wanna make a mark in her book
Gotta get ahead get a car fancy clothes or shell throw you right off her hook
Heres the news you are but one fish in her back garden scene
Gonna make like a shark to be free
Something bad on your mind
Take my tip get on out

You cant give all you got to take something back
Before shell put you right up on her rack
With some others in mind
Take my tip get on out

You think youre gonna please her so you walk right up and tease her
But she walks right on by
Youre scared to walk beside her cause youre playing with the tiger who possess the sky
She got the green backs my oh my
You gotta act tall think big if you wanna make a mark in her book
Gotta get ahead get a car fancy clothes or shell throw you right off her hook

Take my tip get on outLet me introduce you to the gang
Johnny plays the sitar hes an existentialist
Once he had a name now he plays our game
You wont feel so good now that youve joined the gang
Molly is the model in the ads
Crazy clothes and acid full of soul and crazy hip
Someone switched her on then her beam went wrong
Cause she cant switch off now that shes joined the gang
Arthur is a singer with a band
Arthur drinks two bottles just before he goes on stage
Look at Arthur rave all the kids are paid
They want to see the croaking man who joined the gang
You wont be alone weve all got beery grins
Its a big illusion but at least youre in
At least youre in
This clubs called The Webb its this months pick
Next month we shall find a place where prices arent so stiff
fifteen bob a coke fraid thats past a joke
This is how to spend now that youve joined the gang
This is what to do now that youre here
Sit round doing nothing all together very fast
Psychedelic stars throwing down cigars
Theyre picking up the joints now that theyve joined the gangShaky threw a party that lasted all night
Everybody drank a lot of something nice
There was an old fashioned band of married men
Looking up to me for encouragement it was so-so
The ladies looked bad but the music was sad
No one took their eyes off Lorraine
She shimmered and she strolled like a Chicago moll
Her feathers looked better and better it was so-so
Yeah it was time to unfreeze
When the reverend alabaster danced on his knees
Slam so it wasnt a game
Cracking all the mirrors in shame
Watch that man oh honey watch that man
He talks like a jerk but he could eat you with a fork and spoon
Watch that man oh honey watch that man
He walks like a jerk
But hes only taking care of the room
Must be in tune
A Benny Goodman fan painted holes in his hands
So shaky hung him up to dry
The pundits were hoking the manholes were smoking
And every bottle battled with the reason why
The girl on the phone wouldnt leave me alone
A throw back from someones LP
A lemon in a bag played the tiger rag
And the bodies on the screen stopped bleeding
Yeah I was shaking like a leaf
For I couldnt understand the conversation
Yeah I ran to the street looking for information
Watch that man oh honey watch that man
He talks like a jerk but he could eat you with a fork and spoon
Watch that man oh honey watch that man
He walks like a jerk
But hes only taking care of the room
Must be in tuneOh come all you children
Dont grab that scabby hand
It belongs to Mr Sniff and Tell
It belongs to the candyman
Dont whore your little bodies
To the worms of paradise
Like Everest its fatal
Its peaks are cold as ice
Theyre riding on the subways
Theyre riding on the streets
Theyll ride you down to the gutters
Theyll ride you off your feet
Gonna hit Crack City
Hit Crack City
Yeah piss on the icon monsters
Whose guitars bequeath you pain
Theyll face you down to their level
With their addictions and their fast lanes
Corrupt with shaky visions
And crack and Coke and alcohol
Theyre just a bunch of assholes
With buttholes for their brains
You cant keep on riding
The pain you know so well
Theyll ride you down to the gutter
And theyll ride you down to Hell
Gonna hit Crack City
Hit Crack City
And you the master dealer
May death be on your brow
May razors slash your mainline
Im calling you out right now
May all your vilest nightmares
Consume your shrunken head
May the ho-ho-hounds of paranoia
Dance upon your stinking bed
Dont look at me you fuckhead
This nations turning blue
Its stink it fouls the highways
Its filth it sticks like glue
Gonna hit Crack City
Hit Crack City
Theyll bury you in velvet
And place you underground
The hatred of yourself
And the sufferings that conspire
To take your little body
And throw it to the fools
Only your mind can take you out of this
Only your mind or death
Im riding on the subway
The subway down to Hell
Ive finished with this journey
Now I seem to know it well
Gonna hit Crack City

The union of and his bride the Christian

On the redeeming spiritual qualities of sex of sex
Christianity has been pretty modern about sex
Of sex of sex of sex of sex

They aint said I broke no rule
I aint never been in Dutch
I dont browse around too much
Dont bother me leave me alone
Anyway Im almost grown
I dont run around with no mob
Got myself a little job
Im gonna buy me a little car
Drive my girl in the park
Got my eye on a little girl
Ah shes really out of this world
When I take her to the dance
Shes got to talk about romanceInstrumentalFunny how secrets travel
Id start to believe if I were to bleed
Thin skies the man chains his hands held high
Cruise me blond
Cruise me babe
A blond belief beyond beyond beyond
No return No return
Im deranged
Deranged my love
Im deranged down down down
So cruise me babe cruise me baby
CHORUS
And the rain sets in
Its the angel-man
Im deranged
Cruise me cruise me cruise me babe
The clutch of life and the fist of love
Over your head
Big deal Salaam
Be real deranged Salaam
Before we reel
Im deranged
CHORUS two times
Cruise me cruise me cruise me babeWheres the pain in the violent night
Im depressed by the grill
I stay over many years
I should have thought of that
For the love of the money
Like a black-hearted vile thing
Its the nature of being
Its too many lonely nights
I cant tell bad from wrong
I cant pass you by
Too exchanging
Youve been around
But youve changed me
When the flesh meets the spirit world
Where the traffic is thin
I slip from a vacant view
I should have thought of that
And the sound of tomorrow
Like a black-hearted vile thing
Like the silence of tension
Its too many lonely nights
I cant tell good from bad
I cant pass you by
Too exchanging
Youve been around
But youve changed me
Youve been around
Cant pass you by
Youve been around
But youve changed me
Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-change
Too exchanging
Youve been around
But youve changed me
Youve been around
Cant pass you by
Youve been around
But youve changed me
Youve been around
Cant pass you by
Youve been around
But youve changed meAnd when she drowns
Within and in the fizzy gin begins to sigh
Good God oh my I cry
And die and lie beside
She is the apple in my eye
She talked to God
I couldnt cope ord hope eloped
A dope she roped this salty lie
And when shes dreaming I believe
And when shes reading I retreat
Cant believe her telling me shes dead again
Telling me shes dead against it
And deep my wound
Within for every second chance it was thy tore
From deep within despite the rain
My words are worn
She loves to talk into the phone
No matter who no matter when
No matter where
No better than the faulty line
And when shes dreaming I believe
And when shes reading I retreat
Cant believe her telling me shes dead again
Telling me shes dead against itI I wish you could swim
Like the dolphins
Like dolphins can swim
Though nothing nothing will keep us together
We can beat them forever and ever
Oh we can be heroes just for one day
I I will be King
And you you will be Queen
Though nothing will drive them away
We can be heroes just for one day
We can be us just for one day
I I can remember
I remember
Standing by the wall
By the wall
And the guns shot above our heads
Over our heads
And we kissed as though nothing could fall
Nothing could fall
And the shame was on the other side
Oh we can beat them forever and ever
Then we could be heroes just for one day
We can be heroes
We can be heroes
We can be heroes just for one day
We can be heroesI was Ramona A Stone I started with no enemies of my own In a tunnel I was an artiste And Ive been dreaming in a sleep But Ive been having a mid-life crisis And ape men with metal parts Ive spat upon deeply felt age And I hate the funny colored english Well creep together you and I Ive hid my hearts in For I know who the small friends are I am with name I am with name I am Ramona A Stone A night fear female Good timing drone I am with name I am with name I am with name I am with name Itll end in chrome I am Ramona A Stone She should say twitch stream good time drone Night of the female I am with name I am Ramona A Stone She should say I am with name I am Ramona A Stone A millenium fetish A person who loses a name Feels anxiety descending I am Ramona A Stone Left at the crossroads between the centuries I am with name I am with name I am with name Night fear female I am with name Good timing drone I am Ramona A Stone I am Ramona A Stone Give it to me one more time seven Anxiety descending Anxiety descendingSometimes the world is a valley of heartaches and tears
And in the hustle and bustle no sunshine appears
But you and I have our love always there to remind us
There is a way we can leave all the shadows behind us
Volare oh oh Cantare oh oh oh oh
Lets fly way up to the clouds away from the maddening crowds
We can sing in the glow of a star that I know of
Where lovers enjoy peace of mind
Let us leave the confusion and all disillusion behind
Just like birds of a feather a rainbow together well find
Volare oh oh Cantare oh oh oh oh
No wonder my happy heart sings
Your love has given me wings
Your love has given me wingsWholl ride in my rupert the riley

I really cant look at your little empty shelf
A ragged teddy bear
It feels like we never had a chance
Dont look me in the eye
We lay in each others arms
But the room is just an empty space
I guess we lived it out
Something in the air
We smile too fast
Then cant think of a thing to say
Lived with the best times
Left with the worst
Danced with you too long
Nothing left to save
Lets take what we can
I know youll hold your head up high
Weve raged for the last time
A place of no return
And theres something in the air
Something in my eye
Ive danced with you too long
Yeah
Something in the air
Something in my eye
Abracadoo I lose you
We cant avoid the clash the big mistake
Now were going to pay and pay
The sentence of our lives
Cant believe Im asking you to go
We used what we could
To get the things we want
But we lost each other on the way
I guess you know I never wanted anyone more than you
Lived all our best times
Left with the worst
Ive danced with you too long
Say what you will
Theres something in the air
Raged for the last time
But I know youll hold your head up high
Theres nothing we have to say
Theres nothing in our eyes
But theres something in the air
Something in my eye
I danced with you too long
Theres something I have to say
Theres something in the air
Something in my eye
Ive danced with you too long
Danced with you too long
Danced with you too long
And theres something in the air
Something in the airI was walking down the high street
When I heard footsteps behind me
And there was a little old man hello
In scarlet and grey shuffling away laughter

Chuckling away laughing all day laughter

This hmm Grace is my name and and I was hm
It was that phot a fading photograph of
A patch a patchwork quilt
And theyve put me on these
Ramona put me on these interest drugs
So Im thinking very too bit too fast like a brain hatch
And ah they wont let me see anybody
If I want to sometimes and I ask
I can still hear some pop popular musics and aftershocks
Ive been watching a television of um in the homelands
Thats the new homelands and um and thats all I can remember
And now they just want me to be quiet
And I think something is going to be horridLa la la la la la la la etc
Gather you all and listen here
Ill tell you a tale if you lend me an ear
I rode a horse through many a town
But the devil rode me down to the ground
I was to marry a very rich girl
I loved her as only I can
But the father was shot and his gold was stoled
And now Im the devils man na na na
And now I sing a tale of woe
Through the bars of the county jail na la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la etc
I walked into the room one night
I found her mother and gun
Well the man was dead and I kneeled and cried
The sheriff ran in and said Im holding you son
La la la la la la la la etc
Through the day I sing and play
For time is on my side
But when the moon and stars come out
I lay me down and cry
For the Saviour mar I lied
Now I will not have a ride
Beside the window the scaffold was made
On the morrow I will hang
La la la la la la la la etcYou never told me of your other faces
You were the widow of a wild cat
And now I know about your special kisses
And I know you know where thats at
I guess I recognize your destination
I think I see beneath your makeup
What you want is so separation
This is no ordinary
This is no ordinary
Oh oh oh
What a criminal world
The boys are like baby-faced girls
What a criminal girl
Shell show you where to shoot your gun
What a typical mothers son
The only thing that she enjoys
Is a criminal world
Where the girls are like baby-faced boys
Youve got a very heavy reputation
But no-one knows about your low-life
I know a way to find a situation
And hold a candle to your high-life disguise
You caught me kneeling at your sisters door
That was no ordinary stick-up
Im well aware just what youre looking for
I am no ordinary
I am no ordinary
Oh oh oh
What a criminal world
The boys are like baby-faced boys
What a criminal girl
Shell show you where to shoot your gun
What a typical mothers son
The only thing that she enjoys
Is a criminal world
Where the girls are like baby-faced boys
Baby-faced boys
Baby-face
What a criminal world
What a criminal

UnverifiedI was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do What to do What to do
The outlook was decidedly blue
But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day Ive known
CHORUS
A foggy day in London Town
Had me low and had me down
I viewed the morning with alarm
The British Museum had lost its charm
How long I wondered could this thing last
But the age of miracles hadnt passed
For suddenly I saw you there
And through foggy London Town
The sun was shining everywhereJust the twinkling lights of heaven
Two reflections on the sparkling water
Hand in hand with love uh-huh
I love the cheap things that you say
You belong in rock nroll
You belong in rock nroll
You belong in rock nroll
Well so do i
I love how she moves me
It makes me feel alright alright alright alright
Im a hurt Im a hurt Im hurting
Im a man with a beat in my pocket
Im going down to the rhytm of love
I love the bad luck that you bring
You belong in rock nroll
You belong in rock nroll
You belong in rock nroll
Well so do i
Alone on the mean streets
It makes me feel on fire on fire on fire on fire on fire on fire on fire on fire on fire
I love the cheap street in your walk ah ha
You belong in rocknroll
You belong in rocknroll
Well so do i
I love how she moves me
It makes me feel alright alright alright alright If there is something
That I might find
Look around corners
Try to find peace of mind I say
where would you go
If you were me
Trying to keep a straight course is not easy
Somebody special
Looking at me
Same kind of reaction
Wanted to crie with me
Lived here and there
Its too easy to say
But the service just a game a game-ame-ame-ame
I would do anything for you
I would come all day
I would swim all the oceans blue hu
I would walk a thousand miles
Reveal my secrets
More than enough for me to share
I will put roses around the door
Sit in the garden
Growing potatoes by the score
Shake your head girl with your ponytail
Takes me right back when you were young
Throw your precious gifts into the air
Watch them fall down when you were young
Your love - feel you put them on the ground
It use to fall apart when you were young
Your love - feel you put them on the ground
The hills were higher when you were young
Your love - feel you put them on the ground
The trees were taller then when you were young
Your love - feel you put them on the ground
The grass was greener when you were young
Your love could feel you with devotion
Used to walk upon when you were youngBaby Grace is the victim
She was fourteen years of age
And the wheels are turning turning
For the finger points at me

And every lamb ceases to graze
When the kiss of the comb
Tears my face from the bone
Ill be your light
When the shadows fall down the walls
Then life will be done
And it just wont matter at all
I was caught from a hand
Nurtured on grime goodwill and screams
Now your breath fills my step
Now there is you till life is gone
But Ill be your light
When the shadows fall down the walls
Then life will be done
And it just wont matter at all
Ill roll your ball
Till the stars cant make me cry
Then life will be done
And it just wont matter at all
Not at all
When the kiss of the comb
Tears my faceDear when I dance with you
We move like the sea
You youre all I want to know
I feel free
I feel free
I can walk down the street
Theres no one there
The pavement is one huge crowd
I can drive down the road
My eyes cant see
But my mind wants to cry out loud
I can walk down the street
Theres no one there
The pavement is one huge crowd
I can drive down the road
My eyes cant see
But my mind wants to cry out loud
My mind wants to cry out loud
I feel free
Dance floor is like the sea
The ceiling is the sky
Youre the sun and as you shine on me
I feel free
I feel free
I feel freeTin machine tin machine

Somewhere without alcohol
Or goons with muddy hair

The zombies that I pass
The guy that beats his baby up
The preachers and their past

Baby doll baby doll
Clarity and prayer
Theres more than money moving here
Theres mindless maggot glare
Working horrors humping Tories
Spittle on their chins
Carving up my childrens future
Read em pal and grin
Raging raging raging
Burning in my room
Cmon and get a good idea
Cmon and get it soon
Im waiting on the fire escape
Im not exactly well
Im neither red or black or white
Im grey and blown to hell
Tin machine tin machine
Make some new computer thing that puts me on the moon
Not this psycho time-bomb planet poised to meet its maker
Shake a leg
Tin machine tin machine
One sick deathless duty to remain endangered species
They reach right out to touch someone
Then wash their crusty hands
Tin machine
Tin machine
Baby doll baby doll
Blue suede tuneless wonders
Mass confusion faithless blues
Night that spews out watchmen
Mopping up another fortune
Fractured words and branca-sonic
Anger trapped behind locked doors
And right between the eyes
Raging raging raging
Burning in my room
Cmon and get a good idea
Cmon and get it soon
Im waiting on the fire escape
Im not exactly well
Im neither red or black or white
Im grey and blown to hell

Take me anywhereWhen I live my dream Ill take you with me
Riding on a golden horse
Well live within my castle with people there to serve you
Happy at the sound of your voice
Baby Ill slay a dragon for you
Or banish wicked giants from the land
But you will find that nothing in my dream can hurt you
We will only love each other as forever when I live my dream
When I live my dream Ill forgive the things youve told me
And the empty man you left behind
Its a broken heart that dreams its a broken heart you left me
Only love can live in my dream
Ill wish and the thunder clouds will vanish
Wish and the storm will fade away
Wish again and you will stand before me while the sky will paint an ouverture
And trees will play the rhythm of my dream
When I live my dream please be there to meet me
Let me be the one to understand
When I live my dream Ill forget the hurt you gave
Then we can live in our new land
Till the day my dream cascades around me
Im content to let you pass me by
Till that day youll run to many other men
But let them know its just for now
Tell them that Ive got a dream
And tell them youre the starring role
Tell them Im a dreaming kind of guy
And Im gonna make my dream
Tell them I will live my dream
Tell them they can laugh at me
But dont forget your date with me
When I live my dreamIm going home
Ive been gone much too long
She said she missed me
Since I been gone
Ill be back soon
Aint no doubt
cause she said she wanted my loving my loving
No holding back Im going home
No holding back Im going home
Im going stateside with my convictions
No holding back Im going home
No holding back Im going home
Im going stateside with my convictions
I said Im coming home soon
I dont know when
It Ill be sometime soon
Sooner than
I thought Id be
I thought Id be
I thought Id be stateside sooner or later
Marilyn inflatables home on the range
Where the living is easy on a horse with no name
Kennedy convertibles home on the range
Where the suffering comes easy on a blonde with no brain
Im going stateside
Im going stateside
Im going home
Its been so long
She said she missed me
And all the fun weve had
I think it be the best way
She said she missed me
Every every way so
No holding back Im going home
No holding back Im going home
Im going stateside with my convictions
No holding back Im going home
No holding back Im going home
Im going stateside with my convictions
Ive been gone so long
Ive been gone Ive been gone
Im missing you
Marilyn inflatables home on the range
Where the living is easy on a horse with no name
Kennedy convertibles home on the range
Where the suffering comes easy on a ten dollar raise
Im going stateside
Im going statesideWhilst his mothers womb contained the growing Baal
Even then the sky was waiting quiet and pale
Naked young immensely marvelous
Like Baal loved it when he came to us
That same sky remained with him in joy and care
Even when Baal slept peaceful and unaware
At night a lilac sky a drunken Baal
Turning pious as the sky grows pale
So through hospital cathedral whiskey bar
Baal kept moving onwards and just let things go
When Baals tired boys Baal cannot fall far
He will have his sky down there below
When the sinners congregate in shame together
Baal lay naked reveling in their distress
Only sky a sky that will go on forever
Formed a blanket for his nakedness
And that lusty girl the world wholl laughing yield
To the men wholl stand the pressure of her thighs
Sometimes gave him love-bites such as cant be healed
Baal survived it he just used his eyes
And when Baal saw lots of corpses scattered round
He felt twice the thrill despite the lack of room
Space enough said Baal Then Ill thicken the ground
Space enough within this womans womb
Any vice for Baal has got its useful side
Its the man who practices it he cant abide
Vices have their point once you see it as such
Stick to two for one will be too much
Slackness softness are the sort of things to shun
Nothing could be harder than the quest for fun
Lots of strength is needed and experience too
Swollen bellies can embarrass you
Under gloomy stars and this poor veil of tears
Baal will graze a pasture till it disappears
Once its been digested to the forests teeth
Baal trod singing for a well earned sleep
Baal can spot the vultures in the stormy sky
As they wait up there to see if Baal will die
Sometimes Baal pretends hes dead but vultures swoop
Baal in silence dines on vulture-soup
When the dark womb drags him down to its prize
Whats the world still mean to Baal hes overfed
So much sky is lurking still behind his eyes
Hell just have enough sky when hes dead
Once the Earths dark womb engulfed the rotting Baal
Even then the sky was up there quiet and pale
Naked young immensely marvelous
Like Baal loved it when he lived with usWhite boys falling on the fires of night
I wish youd tell I wish youd tell
Flesh punks burning in their glue
Revolution comes in the strangest way
I wish youd tell I wish youd tell
Id rather be inside you
CHORUSone twice
Tell the truth
Tell the truth
Tell the truth
We prick you we prick you we prick you
CHORUStwo twice
You show respect even if you disagree
You show respect
Mama can I kiss you daddy can I tell
we wish you well we wish you well
Innocence passed me by
want to be screwing when the nightmare comes
I wish you well I wish you well
want to come quick then die
CHORUSone twice
All the little rose-kissed foxy girls
Shoes shoes little white shoes
Where have all the flowers gone
All the little fragile champion boys
Toys toys little black toys
Dripping on the end of a gun
Even if you disagree

Niemand gibt uns eine chance
Doch koennen wir siegen
Fuer immer und immer
Und wir sind dann helden
Fuer einen tag

Ich bin dann koenig
Und du

Obwohl sie
Unschlagbar scheinen
Werden wir helden
Fuer einen tag
Wir sind dann wir
An diesem tag
Ich
Ich glaub das zu traeumen
Die mauer
Im ruecken war kalt
Schusse reissen die luft
Doch wir kuessen
Als ob nichts geschieht
Und die scham fiel auf ihre seite
Oh wir koennen sie schlagen
Fyr alle zeiten
Dann sind wir helden
Nur diesen tag
Dann sind wir helden
Dann sind wir helden
Dann sind wir helden
Nur diesen tag
Dann sind wir heldenStay away from the future
Back away from the light
Its all deranged - no control
Sit tight in your corner
Dont tell God your plans
Its all deranged
No control
If I could control tomorrows haze
The darkened shore wouldnt bother me
If I cant control the web we weave
My life will be lost in the fallen leaves
Every single moves uncertain
Dont tell God your plans
Its all deranged
No control
I should live my life on bended knee
If I cant control my destiny
Youve gotta have a scheme
Youve gotta have a plan
In the world of today for tomorrows man
No control
Stay away from the future
Dont tell God your plans
Its all deranged
No control
Forbidden words deafen me
In memory no control
See how far a sinful man
Burns his tracks his bloody robes
Youve gotta have a scheme
Youve gotta have a plan
In the world of today for tomorrows man
I should live my life on bended knee
If I cant control my destiny
No control I cant believe Ive no control
Its all deranged
I cant believe Ive no control
Its all deranged
Deranged
DerangedGetting my facts from a Benneton ad
Im lookin through African eyes
Lit by the glare of an LA fire
Ive got a face not just my race Bang Bang Ive got you babe
Sun comes up and the man goes down
And the woman comes again
Just an hour or so to be safe from fear
Then we jump through hoops were divisable now just disappear
We reach out over race and hold each others hands
Then die in the flames singing we shall overcome
Whoa Whats going on
Therell be some blood no doubt about it
But well come through dont doubt it
I look into your eyes and I know you wont kill me
You wont kill me
You wont kill me
But I look into your eyes
And I wonder sometimes
Oh Lord just let him see me
Lord Lord just let him hear me
Let him call me brother
Let him put his arms around me
Let him put his hands together
Reach over race and hold each others hands
Walk through the night thinking we are the world
Woa Whats going on
Therell be some blood no doubt about it
But well come through dont doubt it
I look into your eyes and I know you wont kill me
You wont kill me
You wont kill me
But I wonder why
Yes and I wonder why sometimes
Theyll show us how to break the rules
But never how to make the rules
Reduce us down to witless punks
Facist cries both black and white whos got the blood whos got the gun
Putting on the black tie cranking out the white noiseMy name is Mr Touchshriek
Of Touchshriek with mail over and fantasy
My shop sells egg shells
Off the seashores and empty females
Im thinking of leasing the room above my shop
To a Mr Walloff Domburg
A reject from the world wide Internet
Hes a broken man Im also a broken man
It would be nice to have company
We could have great conversations
Looking through windows for demons
And watching the young advance in all electric
Some of the houses around here still have inhabitants in them
Im not sure if theyre from this country or not
I dont get to speak much to anyone or that sort of thing
If I had another broken name
Oh I dream of something like thatYou always were the one that knew
They sold us for the likes of you
I always wanted new surroundings
A room to rent while the lizards lay crying in the heat
Trying to remember who to meet
I would take a foxy kind of stand
While tens of thousands found me in demand
Chorus
When you rock n roll with me
No one else Id rather be
Nobody here can do it for me
Im in tears again
When you rock n roll with me
Gentle hearts are counted down
The queue is out of sight and out of sounds
Me Im out of breath but not quite doubting
Ive found a door which lets me outAll our friends
Now seem so thin and frail
Slinky secrets
Hotter than the sun
No peachy frairs
No trendy rechauffe
Im with you
So I cant go on
All my violence raining tears upon the sheets
Im bewildered for were strangers when we meet
Blank screen tv
Preening ourselves in the snow
Forget my name
But Im over you
Blended sunrise
And its a dying world
Humming Rheingold
We scavenge up our clothes
All my violence raging tears upon the sheets
Im resentful for were strangers when we meet
Cold tired fingers
Tapping out your memories
Halfway sadness
Dazzled by the new
Your embrace
It was all that I feared
That whirling room
We trade by vendu
Steely resolve is falling from me
My poor soul poor bruised passivity
All your regrets ran rough-shod over me
Im so glad that were strangers when we meet
Im so thankful cause were strangers when we meet
Im in clover for were strangers when we meet
Heel head over cause were strangers when we meet
Strangers when we meet Are you OK
Youve been shot in the head
And Im holding your brains
The old woman said
So I drink in the shadows
Of an evening sky
See nothing at all
The stars look so special
And the snow looks so old
The frail form is drifting
Beyond the yoga zone
Turn to question the mountain
Why pigs can fly
Its nothing at all
I praise to you
Nothing ever goes away
I praise to you
Nothing ever goes
I praise to you
I praise to you
Nothing ever goes away
I praise to you
Nothing ever goes
I praise to you
Nothing ever goes away
I praise to you
Nothing ever goes nothing ever goes
NothingSee these eyes so green
I can stare for a thousand years
Colder than the moon
Well its been so long
And Ive been putting out the fire with gasoline
See these eyes so red
Red like jungle burning bright
Those who feel me near
Pull the blinds and change their minds
Its been so long
Still this pulsing night
A plague I call a heartbeat
Just be still with me
But it wouldnt believe what Ive been through
Youve been so long
Well its been so long
Ive been putting out the fire with gasoline
Putting out the fire
With gasoline
See these tears so blue
An ageless heart that can never mend
Tears can never dry
A judgment made can never bend

The woman I loved is dead
There was a boy
A very strange enchanted boy
They say he wandered very far
Very far over land and sea
A little child and sailed about
But very wise was he
And then one day one magic day he passed my way
While we spoke of many things fools and kings this he said to me
The greatest thing youll ever learn
Is just to love and be loved in returnWhite light - White light gonna drive me out of my brain
White light - White light gonna make me feel so insane
White heat - White shapin them down to my toes

Questioning saint like and fantastic heroes
Feeling like lost little children in fabled lands
So I listen for each and every friendship
In this Real Cool World
Now there is you
In my Real Cool World
Starry-eyed life but somehow believing in nothing
You whisper sweet nothing but reading between your lines
I listen color me doubtful
In this Real Cool World
Now there is you
In my Real Cool World

Your eyes are heavy and your limbs all ache
Youve bought some coffee butter and bread
You cant make a thing cause the meters dead
You moved away
Hold your folks youre gonna stay away
Bright lights Soho Wardour street
You hope you make friends with the guys that you meet
Somebody shows you round
Now youve met the London boys
Things seem good again someone cares about you
Oh the first time that you tried a pill
You feel a little queasy decidedly ill
Youre gonna be sick but you mustnt lose faith
To let yourself down would be a big disgrace
With the London boys with the London boys
Youre only seventeen but you think youve grown
In the month youve been away from your parents home
You take the pills too much
You dont give a damn about that jobs youve got
So long as youre with the London boysTelling lies
Gorgeous girls are bound to meet
To talk of stars and kings and feet
Through the chromosomes of space and time
Me Im fast like bad infection
Gasping for my resurrection
Swear to me in times of war and stress
Telling lies

Shadow falls in shrinking smiles
See me poised at the happy games
Standing in the mouth of all thats pure
Come straggling in your tattered remnants
You come to me with tears and blame Im your future
Ask tomorrow I am the end

Let me understand
Drifting down a silent park
Stumbling over land
Open up your heart to me
Show me who you are
And I would be your slave
Do you sleep in quietude
Do you walk in peace
Do you laugh out loud at me
No one else that is free
Open up your heart to me
Show me all you are
And I would be your slave
I dont sit around and wait
I dont give a damn
I dont see the point at all
No footprints in the sand
I bet you laugh out loud at me
A chance to strike me down
Give me peace of mind at last
Show me all you are
Open up your heart to me
And I would be your slaveIve been looking Ive been looking
Ive been looking Ive been looking
Ive been looking
For a woman
To save my life
Not to beg or to borrow
A woman with a feeling
of loosing once or twice
Who knows how it could be
Be tomorrow
Ive been waiting for you
And youve been coming to me
For such a long time now
For such a long time now
A woman with a feeling
Of loosing once or twice
Who knows how it could be
Be tomorrow
Ive been waiting for you
And youve been coming to me
For such a long time now
For such a long time now
For such a long time now
For such a long time nowThe words I have to say
May well be simple but theyre true
Until you give your love
Theres nothing more that we can do
Love is the opening door
Love is what we came here for
No-one can offer you more
You know what I mean
Have your eyes really seen
You say you find it hard
To lead the life that we once knew
But theres no other way
So now its really up to you
Love is the key we must turn
Truth is the flame we must learn
Freedom the lesson we must learn
Do you know what I mean
Have your eyes really seen
Love is the key we must turn
Truth is the flame we must burn
Freedom the lesson we must learn
Do you know what I mean
Have your eyes really seen
You say you find it hard
To lead the life that we once knew
But theres no other way
So now its really up to you
Love is the key we must turn
Truth is the flame we must learn
Freedom the lesson we must learn
Do you know what I mean
Have your eyes really seen
Love is the key we must turn
Truth is the flame we must burn
Freedom the lesson we must learn
Do you know what I mean
Have your eyes really seenYou always were the one that knew
They sold us for the likes of you
I always wanted new surroundings
A room to rent while the lizards lay crying in the heat
Trying to remember who to meet
I would take a foxy kind of stand
While tens of thousands found me in demand
CHORUS
When you rock n roll with me
No one else Id rather be
Nobody here can do it for me
Im in tears again
When you rock n roll with me
Gentle hearts are counted down
The queue is out of sight and out of sounds
Me Im out of breath but not quite doubting
Ive found a door which lets me outI just cannot believe
That you want me
Beg at your door
I just cannot believe
That you want me
Forever more
Time and time I tried to make you mine
I didnt think it would be such a short time
Before you came my way
Up where the moon is shining so bright
Thats where my heart is tonight
Up where the moon is so bright
Thats where my heart is tonight
I thought my day would come
When I would be
The only one
I thought my day would come
Under the moon
And under the sun
Now I shout through all the streets today
Lucky me your love has come my way
Now tell me I was a fool
Up where the moon is shining so brightly
Thats where my heart is tonight
Up where the moon is so bright
Thats where my heart is tonight
I believe that dreams come through
I believe because of you
He who made the stars in sky
Made the world for you and i
I just cannot believe
That you want me
Beg at your door
I just cannot believe
That you want me
Forever more
Time and time I tried to make you mine
I didnt think it would be such a short time
Before you came my way
Up where the moon is shining so bright
Thats where my heart is tonight
Up where the moon is so bright
Thats where my heart is tonightI bless you madly
Sadly as I tie my shoes
I love you badly
Just in time at times I guess
Because of you I need to rest
Because its you
That sets the test
So much has gone
And little is new
And as the sparrow sings
Dawn chorus for
Someone else to hear
The Thinker sits alone growing older
And so bitter
I gave Them life
I gave Them all
They drained my very soul
Dry
I crushed my heart
To ease their pains
No thought for me remains there
Nothing can they spare
What of me
Who praised their efforts
To be free
Words of strength and care
And sympathy
I opened doors
That would have blocked their way
I braved their cause to guide
For little pay
I ravaged at my finance just for those
Those whose claims were steeped in peace tranquility
Those who said a new world new ways ever free
Those whose promises stretched in hope and grace for me
I bless you madly
Sadly as I tie my shoes
I love you badly just in time
At times I guess
Because of you I need to rest oh yes
Because its you
That sets the test
So much has gone
And little is new
And as the sunrise stream
Flickers on me
My friends talk
Of glory untold dream where all is God and God is just a word
We had a friend a talking man
Who spoke of many powers that he had
Not of the best of men but ours
We used him
We let him use his powers
We let him fill our needs
Now we are strong
And the road is coming to its end
Now the damned have no time to make amends
No purse of token fortune stands in our way
The silent guns of love
Will blast the sky
We broke the ruptured structure built of age
Our weapons were the tongues of crying rage
Where money stood
We planted seeds of rebirth
And stabbed the backs of fathers
Sons of dirt
Infiltrated business cesspools
Hating through our sleeves
Yea and we slit the Catholic throat
Stoned the poor
On slogans such as
Wish You Could Hear
Love Is All We Need
Kick Out The Jams
Kick Out Your Mother
Cut Up Your Friend
Screw Up Your Brother or Hell Get You In the End
And we know the flag of love is from above
And we can force you to be free
And we can force you to believe
And I close my eyes and tighten up my brain
For I once read a book in which the lovers were slain
For they knew not the words of the Free States refrain
It said
I believe in the power of good
I believe in the state of love
I will fight for the right to be right
I will kill for the good of the fight for the right to be right
And I open my eyes to look around
And I see a child laid slain
On the ground
As a love machine lumbers through desolation rows
Plowing down man woman listening to its command
But not hearing anymore
Not hearing anymore
Just the shrieks from the old rich
And I want to believe
In the madness that calls Now
And I want to believe
That a lights shining through
Somehow
And I want to believe
And you want to believe
And we want to believe
And we want to live
Oh we want to live
We want to live
We want to live
We want to live
We want to live
We want to live
I want to live
I want to live
I want to live
I want to live
I want to live
I want to live
Live
Live

Oh
And I know
Like a mirror Sunday morning
When the dark clouds hung above
I saw you kneeling neath a garden
I saw the grim and stood above
What kind of meaning in a gun shot
It doesnt matter what they say
I never felt I aimed at no one
And whos gonna take the gun away
Julie
Pretend for me
That Im someone in your life
Julie
Im yours till the end
All the days and memories
Im not a man of single reason
Its in every single man
This beat of jealous retribution
And every spurned heart makes its plan
Well I know that you really loved him
And I know that if theres a God above
Through million times well remember
How the trail slips away
Julie
Pretend for me
Even only for a while
Julie
My soul is on the line
All the days and memories
Julie
Remember me
All the days of your life
Julie
Im lost over you

Once upon a time there was a toy soldier with a whip lash in his hand
And every night little girl sadie would take all her clothes off and wind up the toy soldier and he raised his whip and said
On your knees little sadie
Little sadie on your knees
Taste the whip and love might given likely
Taste the whip and bleed for me
Little sadie loved her little toy soldier
And she run home from school each day
Little sadie loved her little toy soldier
And she locked her door so she could play
Little sadie got ambitious
And wound the clockworks so to tighter
So he could whip her harder and harder
On your knees little sadie
Little sadie on your knees
Taste the whip and love might given likely
Taste the whip and bleed for me
One day sadie wound and wound
And wound and wound
And wound and wound
Til suddenly the little toy soldier spring went
ugly beat her to death

Made for a real world

Out of town where the people I knew
I had the feeling of self-pity
What to do what to do what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue
But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day Ive ever known
A foggy day in a london town
Had me low and had me down
I viewed the morning with alarm
The british museum had lost its charm
How long I wondered could this thing last
But the age of miracles hadnt passed
For suddenly I saw you there
And through foggy london town the sun was shining everywhereGrown inside a plastic box
Micro thoughts and safety locks
Hearts become outdated clocks
Tickin in your mind
Now its time to close our eyes
Ahh
Now its time to say goodbye
Ahh
Now its time to face the lie
Ahh
That wed never cry

Falling like the shattered past

Im an absolute beginner - but Im absolutely sane
As long as were together - the rest can go to hell
I absolutely love you - but were absolute beginners
With eyes completely open - but nenrous all the same
If our love-song could fly over mountains
Could laugh at the ocean just like the films -
Theres no reason to feel over hard timesTo lay down the hard lines - its absolutely twe
Nothing much could happen - nothing we cant shakeThough were absolute beginners - weve nothing much at stake
As long as youre still smiling - theres nothing more I need
I absolutely love you - but were absolute beginners
Well if my love is your love - were certain to succeed
If your love-song could fly over mountains
Sail over heartaches just like the films -
If theres reason to feel over hard times

Little Liza Jane
Well Im coming back to me love
Cause shes driving insane
When will I meet herSpy spy pretty girl
I see you see me through your window
Dont turn your nose up
Well you can if you need to you wont be the first or the last
It must strain you to look down so far from your fathers house
And I know what a louse like me in his house could do for you
Im the cream
Of the great Utopia dream
And youre the gleam
In the depths of your bankers spleen
Im a phallus in pigtails
And theres blood on my nose
And my tissue is rotting
Where the rats chew my bones
And my eye sockets empty
See nothing but pain
I keep having this brainstorm
About twelve times a day
So nowYou could spend the morning walking with mequite amazed
As Im unwashed and somewhat slightly dazed
I got eyes in my backside
That see electric tomatoes
On credit card rye bread
There are children in washrooms
Holding hands with a queen
And my heads full of murders
Where only killers scream
So now you could spend the morning talking with me quite amazed
Look out Im raving mad and somewhat slightly dazed
Now you run from your window
To the porcelain bowl
And youre sick from your ears
To the red parquet floor
And the braque on the wall
Slides down your front
And eats through your belly
Its very catching
So nowyou should spend the mornings lying to your father quite amazed
About the strange unwashed and happily slightly dazedWell I pity the fool I said I pity the fool
You know I pity the fool I said I pity the fool
That falls all in love with you and expects you to be true
I pity the fool
Well look at the people
I bet you wonder what they do
Yeah theyre just standing there
Watching you making a fool out of me
Yeah look at the people
I bet you wonder what they do
Yeah theyre just standing there
Watching you making a fool out of me
I pity the fool I said I pity the fool
Ooh I pity the fool let me tell you that I pity the fool
Cos shell break your heart one day and shell laugh as she walks away
Well I pity the fool
Yeah look at the people
Bet you wonder what they do
Well theyre just standing there
Watching you making a fool out of me
Yeah look at the people
Bet you wonder what they do
Well theyre just standing there
Watching you making a fool out of me
I pity the fool I pity the fool that falls in love with you
Hey hey yeah I pity the fool
I pity the fool that falls in love with youThis girl is made of lipstick
Powder and paint
Sees the pictures of herself
Every magazine on every shelf
This girl is maid of bond street
Hailing cabs lunches with executives
Gleaming teeth sip aperitifs
This girl is a lonely girl
Takes the train from paddington to oxford circus
Buys the daily news
But passengers dont smile at her dont smile at her
This girl is made of loneliness
A broken heart
For the boy that she once knew
Doesnt want to know her any more
And this girl is a lonely girl
Every thing she wants is hers
But she cant make it with the boy she really wants to be with
All the time to love all the time
This boy is made of envy
Jealousy
He doesnt have a limousine
Really wants to be a star himself
This girl her world is made of flashlights and films
Her cares are scraps on the cutting room floor
And maids of bond street drive round in chauffered cars
Maids of bond street picture clothes eyes of stars
Maids of bond street shouldnt have worldly cares
Maids of bond street shouldnt have love affairsIm on my own nowhere to roam
I tell you baby dont want no home
I wander round feet off the ground
I even go from town to town
I said I think this rock is grand
Say Ill be your man
Dont bring me down
Dont bring me down
I met this chick the other day
And then to me she said shell stay
I get this pad just like a cave
And then well have our living made
And then Ill lead her on the ground
My head is spinning round
Dont bring me down
Dont bring me down
No
Huh huh huh
I need a lover whos someone new
And then to her I will be true
Ill buy her furs and pretty things
Ill even buy a wedding ring
But until then Ill settle down
Say Ill be your man
Dont bring me down
Dont bring me down
An until then Ill stare the hand
Say Ill be your man
Dont bring me down
Dont bring me down
Dont bring me downSickened by sun with rainstorms lashing him rotten
A looted wreath crowning his tangled hair
Every moment of his youth apart from its dream was forgotten
Gone the roof overhead but the sky was always there
Oh you who are flung out alike from heaven and from Hades
You murderers whove been so bitterly repaid
Why did you part from the mothers who nursed you as babies
It was peaceful and you slept and there you stayed
Still he explores and rakes the absinthe green oceans
Though his mother has given him up for lost
Grinning and cursing with a few odd tears of contrition
Always in search of that land where life seems best
Loafing through hells and flocked through paradises
Calm and grinning with a vanishing face
At times he still dreams of a small field he recognises
With a blue sky overhead and nothing elseDo you remember a guy thats been
In such an early song
Ive heard a rumour from ground control
Oh no dont say its true
They got a message from the action man
im happy hope youre happy too
Ive loved all Ive needed love
Sordid details following
The shrieking of nothing is killing
Just pictures of jap girls in synthesis and i
Aint got no money and I aint got no hair
But Im hoping to kick but the planet its glowing
Ashes to ashes funk to funky
We know major toms a junkie
Strung out in heavens high
Hitting an all-time low
Time and again I tell myself
Ill stay clean tonight
But the little green wheels are following me
Oh no not again
Im stuck with a valuable friend
im happy hope youre happy too
One flash of light but no smoking pistol
I never done good things
I never done bad things
I never did anything out of the blue woh-o-oh
Want an axe to break the ice
Wanna come down right now
Ashes to ashes funk to funky
We know major toms a junkie
Strung out in heavens high
Hitting an all-time low
My mother said to get things done
Youd better not mess with major tom
My mother said to get things done
Youd better not mess with major tom
My mother said to get things done
Youd better not mess with major tom
My mother said to get things done

And I wouldnt go to war
And I mixed with other colors
But the nurse doesnt care
And I hide under blankets
Or did I run away
I really cant remember
Last time I saw the light of day
But I remember Sam cause he was like me
Scream like a baby
Sam was a gun
And I never knew his last name
And we never had no fun
Well they came down hard on the faggots
And they came down hard on the street
They came down harder on Sam
And they all knew he was beat
He was thrown into the wagon
Blindfolded chains and they stomped on us
And took away our clothes and things
And pumped us full of strange drugs
And oh I saw Sam falling
Spitting in their eyes
But now I lay me down to sleep
And now I close my eyes
Now Im learning to be a part of socie-soc-soci-tsociety
Scream like a baby
Sam was a gun
And I never knew his last name
And we never had no fun
No athletic program no discipline no book
He just sat in the backseat swearing hed seek revenge
But he jumped into the furnace singing old songs we loved
Scream like a baby
Sam was a gun
And I never knew his last name
And we never had no fun
Scream like a baby
Sam was a gun
And I never knew his last name
And we never had no funMy name is mr touchshriek
Of touchshriek with mail over and fantasy
My shop sells egg shells off the shesores and empty females
Im thinking of leasing the room above my shop
To a mr walloff domburg
A reject from the world wide internet
Hes a broken man
Im also a broken man
It would be nice to have company
We could have great conversations
Looking through windows for demons
And watching the young advance in all electric
Some of the houses around here still have inhabitants in them
Im not sure if theyre from this country or not
I dont get to speak much to anyone or that sort of thing
If I had another broken name
Oh I dream of something like thatfive hundred and fifteen
Im changing trains
This little town
Let me down
This foreign rain
Brings me down
five hundred and fifteen
Train overdue
Angels have gone
No ticket
Im jumping tracks
Im changing towns
We never talk anymore
Forever I will adore you
five hundred and fifteen
All of my life
Angels have gone
Im changing trains
Angels like them
Thin on the ground
All of my life
All legs and wings
Strange sandy eyes
five hundred and fifteen
Train overdue
Angels have gone
We never talk anymore
Forever I will adore you
Cold station
All of my life
Forever Im out here foreverIf a womans hips are ample
Then I want her in the hay
Skirt and stocking all a rample
Cheerfully
For thats my way
If the woman bites in pleasure
Then I wipe it clean with hay
My mouth her lap together
Thoroughly
For thats my way
If a woman goes on loving
When I feel to tired to play
Id smile and go off waving amiably
For thats my wayTheres a cry that is heard in the city
From Vivian at Pentecost lane
A shriekin and dancing till four am
Another night of muscles and pain
I love you despite your convictions
That God never laughs at my jokes
Im a young man at odds with the Bible
But I dont pretend faith never works
Were down on our knees prayin at the bus stop
Now Jesus He came in a vision
And offered you redemption from sin
Im not sayin that I dont believe you
But are you sure that it really was Him
Ive been told that it couldnve been blue cheese
Or the meal that we ate down the road
Im a young man at odds with the Bible
But I dont pretend faith never works
When were down on our knees prayin at the bus stop oh yeahThink about the good things
Think about the bad things
Think about a reason to see you tonight
Something getting hard when you rock it up
Something getting hot when you rock it up
Pretty little girl let your sweet thing sway
Never gonna treat you wrong
Tie you down pretend youre madonna
Never gonna treat you wrong
Oh you pretty thing
Shake your pretty thing
Gimmee that pretty thing
Think about the love thing
Think about the sex thing
Think about you holding me taking me down
Something getting hard when you rock it up
Something getting hot when you rock it up
Pretty little girl let your sweet thing sway
Never gonna do you wrong
Strip you down and take you to pieces
Always gonna love this song
Oh you pretty thing
Feel that pretty thing

Dont have the time
To look things over
Make up their minds
People from good homes
Dnt have the minds
To care for bad homes
Dont have the time
Home is the main line
Cant take the plain
Those people have notions
Play out this game
Stand on your own line
Stand high above
These people of caution
Trouble to love
Me I got no home
Just main street and wine
No one to hussle no one to jive
Me and my prospects just having a ball
Having the best time but nothing at all
Home is the main line
Cant take the plain
Those people have notions
Play out this game
Stand on your own line

Oh yeahPoor soul
Spit upon that
Poor soul
He never knew what hit him
And it hit him so
Poor dunce
He pushed back the pigmen
The Barbs laughed
The fool is dead
Poor dunce
Hes less than within us
The brains talk
But the will to live is dead
And prayer cant travel so far these days
The talk of your life
Standing so near
To innocent eyes
Poor dunce
Swings through the tunnels
And claws his way
Is small life so manic
Are these really the days
Poor dunce
Poor dunce
Poor soul
Poor soul
Poor soulHe swivels his head
Tears his eyes from the screen
As his past puts him back in Atlantic City
Theres not even a demon in Heaven or Hell
Is it all just human disguise
As I walk down the aisle
Gone gone gone spinning slack through the end
Deadens my brain falling up through the years
Till I swivel back round then I fly fly fly
Losing breath from the water then Im gone gone gone
And Im gone gone gone
Now Im older than movies
Let me dance away
Now Im wiser than dreams
Let me fly fly fly
While Im touching tomorrow
And I know whos there
When silhouettes fall
And Im gone
Like Im dancing on angels
And Im gone through a crack in the past
Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man walking
Three old men dancing under the lamplight
Shaking their sex and their bones
And the boys that we were
An alien nation in therapy
Sliding naked and new
Like a bad tempered child
On a rain slicked street
Gone gone gone spinning slack through the end
Deadens my brain falling up through the years
Till I swivel back round then I fly fly fly
Losing breath from the water then Im gone gone gone
And Im gone
And Im gone like Im dancing on angels
And Im gone through the crack in the past
Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man
Like a dead man walking
And Im gone gone gone
Let me dance dance dance
And Im gone gone gone
Let me dance dance dance
And Im gone like Im dancing on angels
And Im gone through a crack in the past
And Im gone like Im dancing on angels
And Im gone through a crack in the past

Were whats happening
Nightclubbing were nightclubbing
Were an ice machine
We see people brand new people
Theyre something to see
Nightclubbing real nightclubbing
Or isnt it wild
Nightclubbing were nightclubbing
Were walking through town
Nightclubbing were nightclubbing
We walk like a ghost
We learn dancers brand new dances
Like the nuclear bomb
When were nightclubbing
Bright white clubbing
Or isnt it wildI recall how we lived
On the corner of a bed
And wed speak of a Swedish room
Of hessian and wood
And wed talk with our eyes
Of the sweetness in our lives
And tomorrows of rich surprise
Some things we could do
In our madness
We burnt one hundred days
Time takes time to pass
And I still hold some ashes to me
An Occasional Dream
And wed sleep oh so close
But not really close our eyes
Tween the sheets of summer bathed in blue
Gently weeping nights
It was long long ago
And I cant touch your name
For the days of fater were strong for you
Danced you far from me
In my madness
I see your face in mine
I keep a photograph
It burns my wall with time
Time
An occasional dream
Of mine
An occasional dream
Of mine
An occasional dream
Of mineOnce there was a fellow and his name was buzz
He was just a rookie cop just a baby buzz
He patroled the sunset strip in the land of the free and the home of the hip
He protected you and me from evil women like poor alice d
Alice was the girl that all the hippies dread
And they called her sweet alice the head
Alice it was plain to see was full of pot and std
Shed attract a great big crowd because her inner piece was much too loud
Good buzz did the thing that all the good buzz must
Stuck his gun in alices back and said this is a buzz
Shone the flashlight in her eyes she began to hypnotise
Buzz said what a wild sensation guess this must be hallucination
Love is so sensational when you fall in love with eyes dilational
Now theyre taking pills in shops buzz is not afraid of what
Buzz and alice d have shown the way of where the buzz might be some day
Buzz is still a cop of course hes the pusher on the porch
Hes protecting you and me from evil women like poor alice dChorus
All clear wail the sirens
Sunshine on the wasteland
Old man sitting in the white sand
Think were in for a big surprise
Right between the eyes
Seemed a good idea
To drop a bomb on the wasteland here
Only one man could be seen
And he was old and so serene
Captain sat in his deck chair
And the red light flashed Beware
Pilot felt quite big-time
As the bomb sailed through the air
Well they danced and sang
When the bang went bang
When the lights popped out
And the smoke began to clear
It was positively queer
Chorus
Die said the General
Cobblers said the man
So the Pentagon sent a cable
And the Queen a telegram
A-bombs H-bombs even very small ones
Ripped apart that sand
Til the stench was just revolting
And the sky a greenish tan
But the soldier said Sir
Theres a crack in the world
And the figures went squash
And the bits flew far and wide
How the universe sighed
When the smoke had blown away
There was nothing left to view
Except a man dear Lord who looked like you
Floating high up in the skySegue
I was
Ramona A Stone
I started with no enemies of my own
I was an artiste
In a tunnel
But Ive been having a mid-life crisis
And Ive been dreaming of sleep
And ape men with metal parts
Ive spat upon deeply felt age
Ive hid my hearts in
And I hate the funny colored english
Well creep togeher you and I
For I know who the small friends are
Song
I am with name I am with name
I am Ramona A Stone
A night fear female
Good timing drone
I am with name I am with name
I am with name I am with name
I am Ramona A Stone
She should say twitch stream
Itll end in chrome
Night of the female good time drone
I am with name
I am Ramona A Stone
She should say
I am with name
I am Ramona A Stone
A person who loses a name
Feels anxiety descending
Left at the crossroads between the centuries
A millenium fetish
I am with name I am with name
I am Ramona A Stone
I am with name
Night fear female
Good timing drone
I am with name
I am Ramona A Stone
I am Ramona A Stone
Give it to me one more time
Anxiety descending
Anxiety descendingYes Ive read the morning papers
Telling me that youve made money
Do you think Im gonna crawl then think again
Though Im dressed in rags Im richer
Though I eat from tins Im healthier
Though I live in slums Im purer than you my friend
Too bad Im not losing sleep
too bad Im just counting sheep
too bad Im not losing sleep my friend
Look around and see the friends
The ones you left our friends deserted
See the guys that used to talk and drink with you
Dont look down your nose at me
cause I wont ask your sympathy
I wont be your yes-sir man for anything
Too bad Im not losing sleep
too bad Im just counting sheep
too bad Im not losing sleep my friend
I would walk with you
Talk with you drink with you
If you drop that halo that youre wearing on the ground
Too bad Im not losing sleep
too bad Im just counting sheep
too bad Im not losing sleep my friend
I cant get my satisfaction
Knowing you wont get reaction
What makes me the big attraction anyway
Its too bad Im not losing sleep
too bad Im just counting sheep
too bad Im not losing sleep my friend
Too bad Im not losing sleep
too bad Im just counting sheep
too bad Im not losing sleep my friend
Oh its too bad Im not losing sleep
too bad Im just counting sheep
too bad Im not losing sleep my friendI saw him by the dj
The way he danced was cool
They said I stood no chance
They called me little fool
Well here I am before you
And all your friends can see
You roasting like a turkey
Its just this flame in me
And no one can burn like me
I am a laser
Burning through your eyes
And I know what kind of man you are
And I long to hold you tight
I am a laser
Knowing right from wrong
And I know what kind of heart you have
A heart so big and strong
I dreamed how much Id lay on you
Sitting by your side
Driving in my dusenburgh
Going for a ride
Im going to turn my beam on
If only for an hour
You know I switch the heat on
When you feel my golden shower
And no one can burn like me
I am a laser
Burning through your eyes
And I know what kind of man you are
And I long to hold you tight
I am a laser
Knowing right from wrong
And I know what kind of heart you have
A heart so big and strong
I know what the boys call me
They think Im black barbarella
But only one beam do I have
And thats this heartbeat of mine
I am a laser
Burning through your eyes
And I know what kind of man you are
And I long to hold you tight
I am a laser
Knowing right from wrong
And I know what kind of heart you have
A heart so big and strongWell i well I left my wife and child louie go back home

Back to my baby
Back to where they need meIt was a day in that blue month september
Silent beneath the plum trees slender shade
I held her there
My love so pale and silent
As if she were a dream that must not fade
Above us in the shining summer heaven
There was a cloud my eyes dwelled long upon
It was quite white and very high above us
Then I looked up
And found that it had gone
And since that day so many moons in silence
Have swum across the sky and gone below
The plum trees surely have been chopped for firewood
And if you ask how does that love seem now
I must admit I really cant remember
And yet I know what you are trying to say
But what her face was like I know no longer
I only know I kissed it on that day
As for the kiss I long ago forgot it
But for the cloud that floated in the sky
I know that still and shall forever know it
It was quite white and moved in very high
It may be that the plum trees still are blooming
That womans seventh child may now be there
And yet that cloud had only bloomed for minutes
When I looked up
It vanished on the airRamona is so cold
When she broke it off with Leon
She said The ring is enough
I dont wanna see his face again
Ramona was so coldInstrumentalCruising around me
The flames burn my body
Wishful beginnings
Does this remind them again and again
Youre a sorry little girl youre a sorry little girl
Please hide for the pain must feel like snow
Youre a sorry little girl
Sorry little girl
Please hide from the kiss and the bite
Shame burns
Breathing in breathing out
Breathing in only doubt
The pain must feel like snow
Im no longer your golden boy
Sorry little girl
Im sorry little girl
The pain must feel like snow
There you go cover me cover me
We flew on the wings
We were deep in the dead air
And this one will never go down
We had such wishful beginnings
But we lived unbearable lives
Im sorry little girl sorry little girl
So so sorry little girl
The pain must feel like snow
There you go
There you goHey Jack I better shake it off put her out of my head
Thinking I balled just another young girl last night
Oh brother I left a woman in that morning bed
Been on that trip so many times
Good God was it really yesterday
Ive tried so many many many many many many ways
Ive lied and taken off into the day
Leaving another girl to weep over the breakfast tray
Loved her before I knew her name hit me Jack cos Im
Gonna love her way
Come back my babe
Come back my babe
Be holy again I gave her
I gave her maybe maybe
Maybe gotta give her ooh baby baby baby
That kind of love can only destroy
I gave her maybe maybe
Get it down if Im gonna be her baby cos baby
Gonna be me its gonna be me
There was no rein to check me
When all of those little things walked on by
Oh but I couldnt really stammer out a word
When that angel stuck in my mind
Looking for love wont hold me back
No Im gonna love her way
Come back my babe
Come back my babe
Be holy again I gave her
I gave her maybe maybe
Maybe gotta give her ooh baby baby baby
That kind of love can only destroy
I gave her maybe maybe
Get it down if Im gonna be her baby cos baby
Gonna be me its gonna be me
Just playing that latest record
Waiting for the telephone to ring
Wiped out and bitter with a bag clutched in her hand
All the cars sound like theyre pulling in the drive
No no no
I see her now a little tear running down her cheek
Lost let down people looking for me
I want to race down her street
And knock hard
Hard hard on the door until
Until she breaks down into my arms like a
Treasured toy and I feel her pain
Ill be so strong again and again
Come back my baby
Im hold you again Ill take you
Ill take you baby baby baby
Baby were gonna have ooh baby baby baby
My kind of love can only bring you joy Im gonna
Yeah baby baby yeah Ill give you baby baby baby
Cos its gonna be me its gonna be meWar made him a soldier
Little Frankie Mear
Peace left him a loser
The little bombardier
Lines of worry appeared with age
Unskilled hands that knew no trade
Spent his time in the picture house
The little bombardier
Frankie drank his money
The little that he made
Told his woes to no man
Friendless lonely days
Then one day in the ABC
Four bright eyes gazed longingly
At the ice-cream in the hand of
The little bombardier
Sunshine entered our Frankies days
Gone his worries his hopeless maze
His life was fun and his heart was full of joy
Two young children had changed his aims
He gave them toffees and played their games
He brought them presents with every coin he made
Then two gentlemen called on him
Asked him for his name
Why was he friends with the children
Were they just a game
Leave them alone or well get sore
Weve had blokes like you in the station before
The hand of authority said no more
To the little bombardier
Packed his bags his heart in pain
Wiped a tear and caught a train
Not to be seen in the town again
The little bombardierWhen people call us revolutionary
Theyre just tryin to see
All that we choose
When all we want is everybody free
The universe would be one brotherhood
It isnt wrong to be prepared to fight
Together to unite if we believe
In giving everything our heart and soul
Until we reach the goal we should achieve
It shouldnt matter if were brown or white
Yellow or black as night to anyone
Were all born equal with the self same rights
Sharing the same daylight under the sunFame makes a man take things over

Ten dollars tore us apart

One thing nothing meant nothing
Ten dollars tore us apart
On thing led to a dead end
One shot put her away
The last days were the meanest
Leanest days of our lives

Look out on a dream world
Windows and wifes
No bedroom to run too

Come and buy my little toys
Monkeys made of gingerbread
And sugar horses painted red
Rich mens children running past
Their fathers dressed in hose
Golden hair and mud of many acres on their shoes
Gazing eyes and running wild
Past the stocks and over stiles
Kiss the window merry child
But come and buy my toys
Youve watched your father plough the fields with a rams horn
Sowed it wide with peppercorn and furrowed with a bramble thorn
Reaped it with a sharpened scyth thrashed it with a quill
The miller told your father that hed work it with the greatest will
Now your watchings over you must play with girls and boys
Leave the parsley on the stalls
Come and buy my toys
You shall own a cambric shirt
You shall work your fathers land
But now you shall play in the market square
Till youll be a manTheres a brand new dance
But I dont know its name
That people from bad homes do again and again
Its big and its bland full of tension and fear
They do it over there but we dont do it here

Fashion turn to the right -

And well dream if we dont go down

Only fool turns around
And you will fight with demons
And we shall go to town
And you will wear youre best shoes
And well dance if we dont go down
And well dance if we dont go downTheres a little churchyard just along the way
It used to be Lambeths finest array
Of tombstones epitaphs wreaths flowers all that jazz
Til the war came along and someone dropped a bomb on the lot
And in this little yard theres a little old man
With a little shovel in his little bitty hand
He seems to spend all his days puffing fags and digging graves
He hates the reverend vicar and he lives all alone in his home
Ah-choo excuse me
Please Mr Gravedigger dont feel ashamed
As you dig little holes for the dead and the maimed
Please Mr Gravedigger I couldnt care
If you found a golden locket full of some girls hair
And you put it in your pocket
God its pouring down
Her mother doesnt know about your sentimental joy
She thinks its down below with the rest of her toys
And Ma wouldnt understand so I wont tell
So keep your golden locket all safely hid away in your pocket
Yes Mr GD you see me every day
Standing in the same spot by a certain grave
Mary-Ann was only ten full of life and oh so gay
And I was the wicked man who took her life away
Very selfish Oh God
No Mr GD you wont tell
And just to make sure that you keep it to yourself
Ive started digging holes myself
And this one heres for you
Lifted our girl she apparently doesnt know of it
Hello misses thought shed be a little girl
Bloody obscene catch pneumonia or something in this rainSpace boy youre sleepy now
Your silhouette is so stationary
Youre released but your custody calls
And I want to be free
Dont you want to be free
Do you like girls or boys
Its confusing these days
But moon dust will cover you cover you
This chaos is killing me
Bye bye love
This chaos is killing meThere was a time the laughing time
I took my heart to every party
Theyd point my way
how are you today
will you make us laugh chase our blues away
Their funny man wont let them down
No hed dance and prance and be their clown
That time the laughing time
When even a fool learns to love
The clown turned around
And saw her smile oh how she loved me
Shed clap her hands and beg me stay
To make her laugh to make her life gay
Who wants the love of all the world
When here was love in the eyes of just one girl
That day that precious day
When even a fool learns to love
But oh how I dreamed a marvelous dream
Where all of the heavens or so it had seemed
With thunderous applause looked down from above
On a clown and an angel so much in love
Ill stay with my dream it takes such a dream
And even a fool learns to love
That day that hateful day
The joke turned stale the game was over
Those spiteful words oh go away who wants to play
its getting late now
My world my funny world
Had lost its mask and shown a broken heart
A time a sour time
When even a fool learns to loveRamona is so cold
When she broke it off with Leon
She said The ring is enough
I dont wanna see his face again
Ramona was so coldDont look back
Whatever it takes to save your life
Ive believed i belonged to you for a long time
And my heart says no no one but you
Like a rescue on a darkened street
Love walked into town
I was a victim of my own self-persecution
Im a prisoner of love-but im coming up for air
Now dont be fooled by fools who promise you
The world and all that glitters more fool you
Im such a hungry man that i beg you over and over and over and over
And i might take any highway to be there with you
Even the best men shiver in their beds
Im loving you above everything i have
Im a prisoner of love-just stay square
Like a sermon on a blues guitar
Love walked into town
I was drowning so slowly
One step in front of your shadow
Im a prisoner of love but Im coming up for air
Now dont be fooled by fools who promise you
The world and all that glitters more fool you
I smell the sickness sown in this city
It drives me to hide you yeah even deceive you
Im so afraid for you that
Ill break any thug that maps out your passage to ruin
Even the best men shiver in their beds
Im loving you above everything i have
Im a prisoner of love
Im a prisoner of love-just stay square
Take care take care
Im a prisoner of love
Just stay square
Just stay square
Stay out the shooting gallery
Just stay square
I seen the best mans of my generation lay down in cemetery of clematry
Just take care
Just stay square

Dont sit down

On a gemini spacecraft
And I thought about you
I passed through the shadow of jupiter
And I thought about you
I shot my spacegun
And boy I really felt blue
Two or three flying saucers
Parked under the stars
The winding stream
Moon shining down
On some little town
And with each beam
The same old dream
I took a trip
On a gemini spacecraft
And I thought about you
I shot my spacegun
And I thought about you
I pulled down my sun visor
Boy I really felt blue
You jumped into your gemini
I jumped into mine
Well orbit the moon
For just one time
Tomorrow night
Tomorrow night
Will you hold hands
With me in the moonlight
I took a trip
In a gemini spacecraft
And I thought about you
I shot my spacegun
And I thought about you
I took
I took a walk in space
Boy I really felt blue
Well I peeked through the crack
And I looked way back
The stardust trail
Leading back to you
What did I do
What could I do
Yes what did I do
Well
I thought about you
I thought about you
Took a trip
On a gemini spacecraft
Thought about youBetween the dead ring ash of extreme defense
The lonely groups of company boys snapping pics
Of scrawny limbs and toothy grins
These are children riding naked on their tourist pals
While the hollows that pass for eyes swell from withdrawal
As he lies on a mattress in a rat infested room
Talking bout his family and the cold back home
Between the dull cold eyes and the mind unstable
No one over here reads the papers pal
Between the dull cold eyes and the mind unstable
Hes a clean trick and hes shopping for girls
A small black someone jumps over the crazy white god
Cranking up the volume on a Michael Jackson song
Between the dull cold eyes and the mind unstable
No one over here reads the papers pal
Between the dull cold eyes and the mind unstable
Where the frangipani scents the air
She mouths a word that breaks his stare
He grunts his reply in a garrulous croak
Thats a mighty big word for a nine year old
Between the dull cold eyes and the mind unstable
No one over here reads the papers pal
Between the dull cold eyes and the mind unstable
You gaze down in to her eyes for a million miles
You want to give her a name and a clean rag dollValentines Day twenty-five June sixteenth Wednesday July sixth twenty zero twenty fifteen

When Im five
I will read the magazines in mummys drawer
When Im five
I will walk behind the soldiers in the may day parade
cause Im only four and grown-ups walk too fast
Yesterday was horrid day cause raymond kicked my shin
And mummy says if I am good shell let me go to school in August
Daddy shouted loud at mummy and I dropped my toast at breakfast
And I laughed when bonzo licked my face because it tickled
I wonder why my daddy cries and how I wish that I was nearly five
When Im five
I will catch a butterfly and eat it and I wont be sick
When Im five
I will jump in puddles laugh in church and marry my mum
And Ill let my daddy do the washing-up
If I close one eye the people on that side cant see me
I get headaches in the morning and I rode on freddies tricycle
And everywhere was funny when I ran down to the sweetshop
Then I fell and bleeded-up my knee and everybody soppied me
I saw a photograph of jesus and I asked him if hed make me five
I saw a photograph of jesus and I asked him if hed make me five

Theres a sailor who sings
Of the dreams that he brings
From the wide open sea
In the port of Amsterdam
Theres a sailor who sleeps
While the river bank weeps
To the old Willow tree
In the port of Amsterdam
Theres a sailor who dies
Full of beer full of cries
In a drunken town fight
In the port of Amsterdam
Theres a sailor whos born
On a hot muggy morn
By the dawns early light
In the port of Amsterdam
Where the sailors all meet
Theres a sailor who eats
Only fish heads and tails
And hell show you his teeth
That have rotted too soon
That can haul up the sails
That can swallow the moon
And he yells to the cook
With his arms open wide
Hey bring me more fish
Throw it down by my side
And he wants so to belch
But hes too full to try
So he stands up and laughs
And he zips up his fly
In the port of Amsterdam
You can see sailors dance
Paunches bursting their pants
Grinding women to porch
Theyve forgotten the tune
That their whiskey voice croaked
Splitting the night
With the roar of their jokes
And they turn and they dance
And they laugh and they lust
Till the rancid sound of the accordion bursts
And then out of the night
With their pride in their pants
And the sluts that they tow
Underneath the street lamp
In the port of Amsterdam
Theres a sailor who drinks
And he drinks and he drinks
And he drinks once again
Hell drink to the health
Of the whores of Amsterdam
Whove given their bodies
To a thousand other men
Yeah theyve bargained their virtue
Their goodness all gone
For a few dirty coins
When he just cant go on
Throws his nose to the sky
Aims it up above
And he pisses like I cry
On the unfaithful love
In the port of Amsterdam
In the port of AmsterdamMy death waits like an old rouÃ
So confident Ill go his way
Whistle to him and the passing time
My death waits like a bible truth
At the funeral of my youth
Weep loud for that and the passing time
My death waits like a witch at night
As surely as our love is bright
Lets not think about the passing time
Chorus
But what ever lies behind the door
There is nothing much to do
Angel or devil I dont care
For in front of that door there is you
My death waits like a beggar blind
Who sees the world through an unlit mind
Throw him a dime for the passing time
My death waits there between your thighs
Your cool fingers will close my eyes
Lets not think of that and the passing time
My death waits to allow my friends
A few good times before it ends
So lets drink to that and the passing time
Chorus
My death waits there among the leaves
In magicians mysterious sleeves
Rabbits and dogs and the passing time
My death waits there among the flowers
Where the blackest shadow blackest shadow cowers
Lets pick lilacs for the passing time
My death waits there in a double bed
Sails of oblivion at my head
So pull up the sheets against the passing time
ChorusTranslation by mia berg
Schan aus deinen fenster schau wer draussen sitzt

Na ja vieleicht wird sie auch mittwochOh my love Janine
Im helpless for your smile
Like a Polish wander
I travel ever onwards to your land
And were it not just for the jewels Id close your hand
Your strange demand
To collocate my mind
Scares me into gloom
Youre too intense
Ill have to keep you in your place
Ive no defense
Ive got to keep my veil on my face
Janine Janine youd like to know me well
But Ive got things inside my head
That even I cant face
Janine Janine youd like to crash my walls
But if you take an axe to me
Youll kill another man
Not me at all
Youre fey Janine
A tripper to the last
But if I catch you standing on my toes
Ill have a right to shout you down
For youre a lazy stream
In which my thoughts would drown
So stay Janine
And we can glide along
Ive caught your wings for laughs
Im not obliged to read you statements of the year
So take your glasses off
And dont act so sincere
Janine Janine youd like to know me well
But Ive got things inside my head
That even I cant face
Janine Janine youd like to crash my walls
But if you take an axe to me
Youll kill another man

Dance magic dance dance magic danceHeres the town in which I live petunia green
Heres the shop and heres the man who sold me laces for my shoes
There is mrmarcus boys they say hes mad
heres the battle that they won silver treetop school for boys
Early days were good as gold
An apple here an apple there
And everywhere a yes sir no sir
They made me roll the cricket pitch once a day
Ive never been so happy than at silver treetop school for boys
The mowing machine was leaving small piles of grass
That when the had risen to the pipe of mrmarcus
The smell of teaching fell upon the cricket field
Smiling laughing rolling about at silver treetop school for boys
Hey there
They call in the staff room
They call in the canteen
hey come and look at what I found
i found some boys and masters sitting
On the cricket ground at silver treetop school for boysWas walking through the counters of a national concern
And a cash machine was spitting by my shoulder
And I saw the multitude of faces honest rich and clean
As the merchandise exchanged and money roared
And a woman hot with worry slyly slipped a tin of stewing steak
Into the paper bag at her side
And her face was white with fear in case her actions were observed
So she closed her eyes to keep her conscience blind
Crying
God knows Im good
God knows Im good
God knows Im good
God may look the other way today
God knows Im good
God knows Im good
God knows Im good
God may look the other way today
Then she moved toward the exit clutching tightly at her paper bag
Perspiration trickled down her forehead
And her heart it leapt inside her as the hand laid on her shoulder
She was led away bewildered and amazed
Through her deafened ears the cash machines were shrieking on the counter
As her escort asked her softly
For her name
And a crowd of honest people rushed to help a tired old lady
Who had fainted to the whirling
Wooden floor
Crying
God knows Im good
God knows Im good
God knows Im good
Surely God wont look
The other way
God knows Im good
God knows Im good
God knows Im good
Surely God wont look
The other wayAs soon as youre born they make you feel small
By giving you no time instead of it all
Till the pain is so big you feel nothing at all
A working class hero is something to be
A working class hero is something to be
They hurt you at home and they hit you at school
They hate you if your clever and they despise a fool
Till youre so fucking crazy you cant fallow their rules
A working class hero is something to be
A working class hero is something to be
When theyve tortured and scared you for twenty odd years
Ah then they expect you to pick a career
When you cant really function youre so full of fear
A working class hero is something to be
A working class hero is something to be
Keep you doped wit religion and sex and TV
And you think youre so clever and classless and free
But youre still fucking peasants as far as I can see
A working class hero is something to be
A working class hero is something to be
Theres room at the top they are telling you still
But first you must smile as you kill
But if you want to be like the folks on the hill
A working class hero is something to be
A working class hero is something to be
If you want to be a hero well just follow me
If you want to be a hero well just follow me
Just follow meOver the wall we go
All coppers are nanas
Over the wall we go
Leave him a note saying Wish you was here
I know the best ways to break out of here
I helped a young laddie called Ivan
Over the wall last night
Then he climbed back and he grabbed me tight
He uttered some words that I cant say to you
Cause he remembered that he was a screw
Over the wall we go
All coppers are nanas
Over the wall we go
Leave him a note wishing Happy New Year
My name is Henry
Some say Im thick
Ive spent half me life in and out of nick
Me mum sends me presents to keep me in style
Soggy old cakes and hundreds of files
God sussed all them files

Now Im just stupid with manicured hands
Over the wall we go
All coppers are nanas

Over the wall we go
Nobodys left and the screws are in tears
We tried digging tunnels but gave up the ghost
Just past the Kensington Yards at the most
Our limbs was aching we felt pretty pooped
Our clothes they was tatty our hallows did droop
We crawled back to safety our hearts filled with gloom
Cause wed dug ourselves through to the smallest room
Over the wall we go
All coppers are nanas
Over the wall we go
Leave him a note wishing Happy New Year

Is delay just wasting my time
Looking across at Richard rogers
Scheming dreams to blow both their minds
Its difficult you see
To give up baby
To leave a job
When you know the moneys from day to day
All the majesty of a city landscape
All the soaring days of our lives
All the concrete dreams in my minds eye
All the joy i see through these architects eyes
Cold winter bleeds on the girders of babel
This stone boy watching the crawling land
Rings of flesh and the towers of iron
The steaming caves and rocks and the sand
Stomping along on this big Philips Johnson
Is delay just wasting my time
Its difficult you see
To give up baby
These summer scumholes
This goddamned starving life
All the majesty of a city landscape
All the soaring days of our lives
All the concrete dreams in my minds eye
All the joy i see through these architects eyes
Its difficult you see
Its difficult you see
All the majesty of a city landscape
All the soaring days in our lives
All the concrete dreams in my minds eye
All the joy i see through these architects eyesWar made him a soldier
Little Frankie Mear
Peace left him a loser
The little bombardier
Lines of worry appeared with age
Unskilled hands that knew no trade
Spent his time in the picture house
The little bombardier
Frankie drank his money
The little that he made
Told his woes to no man
Friendless lonely days
Then one day in the ABC
Four bright eyes gazed longinly
At the ice-cream in the hand of
The little bombardier
Sunshine entered our Frankies days
Gone his worries his hopeless maze
His life was fun and his life was full of joy
Two young children had changed his aims
He gave them toffees and played their games
He brought them presents with every coins he made
Then two gentlemen called him
Asked him for his name
Why was he friends with the children
Were they just a game
Leave them alone or well get sore
Weve had blokes like you in the station before
The hand of authority said no more to
The little bombardier
Packed his bags his heart in pain
Wiped a tear caught a train
Not to be seen in the town againWhen you speak you speak to me
When you sleep you sleep by me
When you wake you wake with me
When you walk you follow two steps behind in life
Shadows stalking ever grasping sinking for a need
It wasnt love it was the fix of never wanting me
Now Im gone youre tossing and you turning in your sleep
Thats the name of the game of the game of the game
Cry Miss Peculiar
Youll cry all the more now Im gone
I was the monkey on your back
Take a look at how lucky you are
When you speak you speak to me
When you sleep you sleep by me
When you wake you wake with me
When you walk you follow two steps behind
Cry cry Miss Peculiar
Youll cry all the more now Im gone
I was the monkey on your back
Take a look at how lucky you are
Some days are heaven I will not deny
Probing the daylight cascading the skyline
Tripping and diving and losing it all
Back came the night time living for more
Cry cry Miss Peculiar
Youll cry all the more now that Im gone
I was the devil monkey on your back
Take a look at how lucky you are
When you speak you speak to me
When you sleep you sleep by me
When you wake you wake with me
When you walk you follow two steps behind
La La La La LaSome days he feels so empty just a talking head
Married to a Klingon whod cream him in the press
God could detonate him Gods the one we pick to curse us
And twenty-five years pass him like an evening at the circus
Dont sacrifice yourself dont sacrifice yourself
Surprise yourself dont sacrifice yourself
Dont sacrifice yourself dont sacrifice yourself
There it is the look the winner you once talked of being
Give her one last kiss and dive right out the window screaming
No truth decent it was summer from the waist down
She blew the troops right off your feet tells you shes Gods Grammy
Dont sacrifice yourself dont sacrifice yourself
Surprise yourself dont sacrifice yourself
Dont sacrifice yourself dont sacrifice yourself
Her the only game in town a queen of competence
Blind in front of mirrors proving nothing says a lot
Wham bam thank you Charles vanity is all
You wander lonely to the scene a-crawling up the walls
Dont sacrifice yourselfI took this walk to ease my mind
To find out whats gnawing at me
And wouldnt think to look at me
That Ive spent a lot of time in education
All seems so long ago
Im a thinker not a talker
Ive no-one to talk to anyway
I cant see the road
For the rain in my eyes
I live above the grocers store
Owned by an Austrian
He often calls me down to eat
And he jokes about his broken English
Tries to be a friend to me
But for all my years of reading conversation
I stand without a word to say
I cant see the bridge
For the rain in my eyes
And the world is full of life
Full of folk who dont know me
And they walk in twos or threes or more
While the light that shines above the grocers store
Investigates my face so rudely
And my essays lying scattered on the floor
Fulfill their needs just by being there
And my hands shake my head hurts
My voice sticks inside my throat
Im invisible and dumb and no one will recall me
And I cant see the water through the tears in my eyesTest testing testing
This hmm Grace is my name and and I was hm
It was that phot a fading photograph of
A patch a patchwork quilt
And theyve put me on these
Ramona put me on these interest drugs
So Im thinking very too bit too fast like a brain hatch
And ah they wont let me see anybody
If I want to sometimes and I ask
I can still hear some pop popular musics and aftershocks
Ive been watching a television of um in the homelands
Thats the new homelands and um and thats all I can remember
And now they just want me to be quiet
And I think something is going to be horridNow we can talk in confidence
Did you guess that weve been done wrong
Lies jumped the queue to be first in line
Such a shameless design
He thinks hes well screened from the man at the top
Its a shame that his children disagree
They coolly decide to sell him down the line
Daddys brainwashing time
Hes a dodo no no didnt hear it from me
Hes a dodo no no didnt hear it from me
Shes quite enthralled with the childhood of yore
When a unit was a figure not a she
When lovers chose each other now the perks are due
Another memo to screw
Shes a dodo no no didnt hear it from me
Shes a dodo no no didnt hear it from me
Can you wipe your nose my child
Without them slotting in your file a photograph
Can you sleep alone at night
Wake to find the scorching light of neighbor Jim
Hes come to turn you in
Another dodo no no didnt hear it from me
Another dodo no no didnt hear it from me
Another dodo didnt hear it from meSkeletal city highs
Crazies with dumb replies
Nobodys eyes anymore
Frown on your beggars face
Walking this lunarscape
Nothing in my lackaday
CHORUS
Well all be right
Well all be right
Well all be right in the now
We all go through
We all go through
We all go through it sometimes
Somebodys space to rent
Somebodys soul to dent
Dog is in every word
Hiding the flames of power
Hiding us home by home
Nearly got out yesterday
CHORUS
Trouble it travels on the wing
Doorway to door
Open your eyes
Nothing remains
A secret love between us
Nothing can hide for long
We are the morning song
Holding my breath anyway
CHORUS Black eyed ravens
They spiral down
They tilt his head back
To the flame filled sunset
Raise their guns high
As the darken falls
These are the days boys
Shallow man
Shallow man and they
Eats in the doorway
With his head inclined
And hes always in decline
No-one heals anymore
So he shrinks as they ride
Under vermillion sky
So it goes
Just a searcher
A lonely soul
The last of the dreamers
Shallow man
Shallow man
Speaks to the shadows
Moves his trembling hands
And hes always a little late
For the dawning of the dayRubber Band
Theres a rubber band that plays tunes out of tune
In the library garden Sunday afternoon
While a little chappie waves a golden wand
Rubber Band
In one thousand, nine hundred and ten I was so handsome and so strong
My moustache was stiffly waxed and one foot long
And I loved a girl while you played teatime tunes
Dear Rubber Band youre playing my tune out of tune oh
Rubber Band
Wont you play a haunting theme again to me
While I eat my scones and drink my cup of tea
The sun is warm but its a lonely afternoon
Oh play that theme
Rubber Band
How I wish that I could join your Rubber Band
We could play in lively parks throughout the land
And one Sunday afternoon Id find my love
Rubber Band
In the fourteen-eighteen war I went to sea
Thought my Sunday love was waiting home for me
And now shes married to the leader of the band oh

Unless you claim infertility
So who will buy a drink for me your messiah
We are not your friends
We dont give a damn for what youre saying
Were here to live our lives
I propose to give the pill
Free of charge to those that feel
That they are not infertible

Theres only one way to linger on
So who will buy a drink for me your messiah
We are not your friends

Let me explain my project dear
Show you how Ill save the world
Or let it die within the year

Threepenny pierrot - loves us too
Pockets of gladness gay time eyes
Comical hero threepenny pierrot
Happy little feet that dance all day
Lonely little heart with lots to say
Stepping footprints on your mind
Offering thoughts of columbine
Bang the drum and blow the bugle call
Pierrot takes the stage to play for all
For heres a life his fortune rules
Forsaken by his columbine
Threepenny pierrot - we love you
Threepenny pierrot - loves us too
Pockets of gladness gay time eyes
Comical hero threepenny pierrot
To tap his feet to greet dear harlequin
The hearts of folks so keenly hard to win
A patchwork frame of tears and wine
The nectar for cruel columbine
The part of three and leaves the stage forlorn
Puppets cold their faces sad and drawn
Relive each trial of rise and fall
The love which lacks between us all
Threepenny pierrot - we love you
Threepenny pierrot - loves us too
Pockets of gladness gay time eyes
Comical hero threepenny pierrot
Threepenny pierrot - we love you

Of the dreams that he brings from the wide open sea
In the port of Amsterdam theres a sailor who sleeps
While the river bank weeps to the old willow tree
In the port of Amsterdam theres a sailor who dies
Full of beer full of cries in a drunken town fight
In the port of Amsterdam theres a sailor whos born
On a hot muggy morn by the dawns early light
In the port of Amsterdam where the sailors all meet
Theres a sailor who eats only fish heads and tails
And hell show you his teeth that have rotted too soon
That can haul up the sails that can swallow the moon
And he yells to the cook with his arms open wide
Hey bring me more fish throw it down by my side
And he wants so to belch but hes too full to try
So he stands up and laughs and he zips up his fly
In the port of Amsterdam you can see sailors dance
Paunches bursting their pants grinding women to porch
Theyve forgotten the tune that their whiskey voice croaked
Splitting the night with the roar of their jokes
And they turn and they dance and they laugh and they lust
Till the rancid sound of the accordion bursts
And then out of the night with their pride in their pants
And the sluts that they tow underneath the street lamps
In the port of Amsterdam theres a sailor who drinks
And he drinks and he drinks and he drinks once again
Hell drink to the health of the whores of Amsterdam
Whove given their bodies to a thousand other men
Yeah theyve bargained their virtue their goodness all gone
For a few dirty coins well he just cant go on
Throws his nose to the sky and he aims it up above
And he pisses like I cry on the unfaithful love
In the port of Amsterdam
In the port of AmsterdamShes just been to russia and theyre dying their faces
Theyre dying over there
A pretty pink rose
That rnr lady takes a space-ship ride shes out of this world
A pretty pink rose
And were living for you my love were living for you

And were living for you my love were living for you
And were dying for you my love
Pretty pink rose

Flying in the face of the despot cannible
Shes a pretty pink rose
Never let it rain never let it rain on the heart of the pretty pink rose
Pretty pink rose
And were living for you my love were living for you
And were dying for you my love pretty pink rose
Get me thru the pain thru the pain of the thorn on the pretty pink rose
Never let it rain never rain never rain the pretty pink rose
Take me to the heart to the heart to the heart of the pretty pink rose
Take me to the heart to the heart to the heart
Take me to the heart to the heart to the heart of the pretty pink rose
Take me to the heart to the heart to the heart
Take me to the heart to the heart to the heart of the pretty pink rose
Take me to the heart to the heart to the heartNothing on smoke today
Nothing dies on the wing
Wings been losing time
An anarchy born in pain
Pain that comes and goes
It goes against all you see
You see I got gables eyes
And eisenhower blames the poor
The poor huddled on the curb
Gotta get back in shape
Were backing up a major plan
Were treading on lights
Were walking under golden sun
Were living in a planet of dreams
Were living in a planet of dreams
Were living in a planet of dreams
Were living in a planet of dreams
Were living in a planet of dreams
Were living in a planet

Screws the tops on all the bottles turns the lights out locks it up
Climbs across his bike and hes away
Cycles past the gasworks past the river down the high street
Back to mother its another empty day
Uncle Arthur likes his mommy
Uncle Arthur still reads comics
Uncle Arthur follows Batman
Round and round the rumours fly how he ran away from Mum
On his thirty-twond birthday told her that hed found a chum
Mother cried and raved and yelled and fussed
Arthur left her no illusion brought the girl round save confusion
Sally was the real thing not just lust
Uncle Arthur vanished quickly
Uncle Arthur and his new bride
Uncle Arthur follows Sally
Round and round goes Arthurs head hasnt eaten well for days
Little Sally may be lovely but cooking leaves her in a maze
Uncle Arthur packed his bags and fled
Back to mother alls forgiven serving in the family shop
He gets his pocket money hes well fed
Uncle Arthur past the gasworks
Uncle Arthur past the river
Uncle Arthur down the high street
Uncle Arthur follows motherCruising around me
The flames burn my body
Wishful beginnings
Does this remind them again and again
Youre a sorry little girl
Youre a sorry little girl
Please hide
For the pain must feel
Like snow
Youre a sorry little girl
Sorry little girl
Please hide from the kiss and the bite
Shame burns
Breathing in breathing out
Breathing in only doubt
The pain must feel like snow
Im no longer your golden boy
Sorry little girl
Im sorry little girl
The pain must feel like snow
There you go
Cover me cover me
We flew on the wings
We were deep in the dead air
And this one will never go down
We had such
Wishful beginnings
But we lived
Unbearable lives
Im sorry little girl
Sorry little girl
So so sorry little girlI stood stone-like at midnight suspended in my masquerade
I combed my hair till it was just right and commanded the night brigade
I was open to pain and crossed by the rain and I walked on a crooked crutch
I strolled all alone through a fallout zone and came out with my soul untouched
I hid in the clouded wrath of the crowd but when they said Sit down I stood up
Ooh-ooh growin up
The flag of piracy flew from my mast my sails were set wing to wing
I had a jukebox graduate for first mate she couldnt sail but she sure could sing
I pushed be	-fifty-two and bombed em with the blues with my gear set stubborn on standing
I broke all the rules strafed my old high school never once gave thought to landing
I hid in the clouded wrath of the crowd but when they said Come down I threw up
Ooh-ooh growin up
I took month-long vacations in the stratosphere and you know its really hard to hold your breath
I swear I lost everything I ever loved or feared I was the cosmic kid in full costume dress
Well my feet they finally took root in the earth but I got me a nice little place in the stars
And I swear I found the key to the universe in the engine of an old parked car
I hid in the mother breast of the crowd but when they said Pull down I pulled up
Ooh-ooh growin up Ooh-ooh growin upAnd as the sparrow sings
Dawn chorus for
Someone else to hear
The thinker sits alone growing older
And so bitter
She gave them life
She gave them all
They drained her very soul drydry
Hey hey hey bitter girl
Were out to sitting here digging you
We flew done here just to figure you
Its easy
Dont be so bitter
Oh oh oh crazy girl
You gave too much and you got nothing
Too many problems and not one thing
In return
Left high and dry
Door
And as the sun rise stream
Flickers on
She finds lavender
To fight the beckoningWash your face before your faded make-up makes a mark
The mirror will watch over you
Pierrot never comes so pack your face and chase the dark
The mirrors hung up on you
Dont be last your friends and your reflection
Its all so direction now
Poor harlequin youre quite an exception
Fay troubadour on a downer
Gay harlequin doesnt believe in you
Doesnt believe its true such a downerBurning up each others love burning up our lives
Tried all kinds of working out miracle goodnight
Future full and empty knocking on my door
Ragged limbed and hungry mama
Miracle no more
Skin tell me turn it around
Head tell me make it alright
Nobody dancing
Morning star youre beautiful yellow dime on high
Spin you round my little room miracle goodnight
Evening flower all alone puzzling capeche
Havent got a death wish just want a little more
CHORUS
Skin tell me turn it around
Head tell me make it alright
Nobody dancing miracle goodnight
Breath tell me turn it around
Heart tell me make it alright
Nobody dancing it was only make believe
I wish I was a sailor a thousand miles from here
I wished I had a future anywhere
I love you in the morning sun I love you in my dreams
I love the sound of making love the feeling of your skin
The corner of your eyes I long forevermore
I never want to say goodnight miracle goodnight
Chorus
Dont want to know the past I want to know the real deal
I really dont want to know that
The less we know the better we feel
Morning star youre beautiful yellow diamond high
Spinning around my little room miracle
Chorus
Skin tell me turn it around
Moon tell me make it alright
Nobody dancing it was only make believe
Eyes tell me turn it around
News tell me make it alright
Nobody dancing
ChorusSilhouettes and shadows watch the revolution
No more free steps to heaven
Just walkie-talkie Heaven or Earth
Just big heads and drums
Full speed and pagan and its no game
I am barred from the event
I really dont understand the situation
So wheres the moral
People have their fingers broken
To be insulted by these fascists
Is so degrading and its no game
Documentaries on refugees couples gainst the target
Throw a rock against the road and it breaks into pieces
Draw the blinds on yesterday and its all so much scarier
Put a bullet in my brain and it makes all the papers and its no gameSkin dance back-a-the condo
Skin heads getting to school
Beating on blacks with a baseball bat
Racism back in rule
White trash picking up Nazi flags
While you was gone there was war
This is the west get used to it
They put a Swastika over the door
Under the God under the God
One step over the red line
Under the God under the God
Ten steps into the crazy crazy
Washington heads in the toilet bowl
Dont see supremacist hate
Right wing dicks in their boiler suits
Picking out who to annihilate
Toxic jungle of Uzi trails
Tribesmen just wouldnt live here
Fascist flare is fashion cool
Well youre dead you just aint buried yet
Under the God under the God
Under the God under the God
As the walls came tumbling down
So the secrets that we shared
I believed you by the palace gates
Now the savage days are here
Under the God
Under the God under the God
One step over the red line
Under the God under the God
One steps into the crazy crazy
Crazy eyed man with a shot gun
Hot headed creep with a knife
Love and peace and harmony
Love you could cut with a knife
Under the God under the God
Under the God under the GodYou have loved me with energy
Backed up with hard work and guts
We inhabit eternity
We fly forever in space
The way we run together
The way we breeze the miles
We put our heads together
And laughingly we smile
It cant fall
It cant fall
Baby it cant fall
Death means nothing at all
It cant fall
It cant fall
Baby it cant fall
Our love will outlive this earth
Words have so many meanings
Sometimes mean nothing at all
Sometimes I feel so simple
I dont know whats coming next
We have swum in the ocean
And that was really alright
Im not a big man
Its hard to face the world
It cant fall
It cant fall
Baby it cant fall
Death means nothing at all
It cant fall
It cant fall
Baby it cant fall
Our love will outlive this earth
It cant fallHey hey its the tall sail on a beach reach for Java
Make way for to Java watching for Boogies
Hey hey its a dreaming I would burn you if you should die
Hey hey I should burn too if you should lie upon that bamboo pyre
I dream of Amlapura never saw in all my life a more shining jewel
I dream of Amlapura of an ocean or dream of a princess in stone
Hey hey golden roses around a rajahs mouth
Hey hey all the dead children buried standing
A flying dutchman smoking gun and spice wind
I dream of Amlapura never saw in all my life a more shining jewel
I dream of Amlapura of an ocean or dream of a princess in stoneWhilst flying through an azure cloud
A crystal girl id spy
She kissed the blue birds honey tongue
And stuttered as she sighed
I wish to sing the chicken song
Ching-a-ling song is fine
Id give my jewels and caviar
To make this daydream mine
Ching-a-ling ching-a-ling ching-a-ling ching-a-ling
Ching-a-ling ching-a-ling ching-a-ling ching-a-ling
Ching-a-ling ching-a-ling ching-a-ling
Doo dah doo doo dah dah doo dah dah dah dah dah dah dah
While stepping through a heavens eye
Two lover souls we spied
They wished the cloud boys sang to me
A cheerful happy cry
We love to play our love-strong hearts
No better do we know
No gifts of money do we give
For love is all we own
Na na na na na na na na na na na na na na
Ching-a-ling ching-a-ling ching-a-ling ching-a-ling
Ching-a-ling ching-a-ling ching-a-ling ching-a-ling

Ching-a-ling ching-a-ling ching-a-ling ching-a-ling
Ching-a-ling ching-a-ling ching-a-lingThe children of the summers end
Gathered in the dampened grass
We played Our songs and felt the London sky
Resting on our hands
It was Gods land
It was ragged and naive
It was Heaven
Touch we touched the very soul
Of holding each and every life
We claimed the very source of joy ran through
It didnt but it seemed that way
I kissed a lot of people that day
Oh to capture just one drop of all the ecstasy that swept that afternoon
To paint that love upon a white balloon
And fly it from the toppest top of all the tops that man has pushed beyond his
Brain
Satoria must be something just the same
We scanned the skies with rainbow eyes and saw machines of every shape and size
We talked with tall Venusians passing through
And Peter tried to climb aboard but the Captain shook his head
And away they soared
Climbing through the ivory vibrant cloud
Someone passed some bliss among the crowd
And we walked back to the road unchainedI dont know why but Im tired of my mind
Pain is over me overloading
I dont know why but youre trying to be kind
Take off your silver smile throw your head back
And cry
I dont believe but Im trying to decide
Which game is best for me which can I bare
You dont perseve so Im leading you away
Home were youve never been non-returning
So cry
Throw a rock upon the road and it breaks into pieces
Shake brach upon the snow and the sun is defeated
Pull the curtains on yesterday and it seems so much later
Put a bullet in my brain and Ill make all the papers
I dont know why but Im tired of my life
The clouds are in my eyes overtakingWhat are you doing to yourself
What are you doing to yourself
What are you doing to yourself
Its the last thing you should do
Nobody laughs anymore
Nobody laughs anymore
Nobody laughs anymore
Its the worst thing you can do
Save the last dance for me
Catch the last bus with me
Give the last kiss to me
Its the safest thing to doCome they told me
Pa-rum-pum-pum-pum
A new born king to see
Pa-rum-pum-pum-pum
Our finest gifts we bring
Pa-rum-pum-pum-pum
Rum-pum-pum-pum
Rum-pum-pum-pum
Peace on earth can it be
Years from now perhaps well see
See the day of glory
See the day when men of good will
Live in peace live in peace again
Peace on earth can it be
Every child must be made aware
Every child must be made to care
Care enough for his fellow man
To give all the love that he can
I pray my wish will come true
For my child and your child too
Hell see the day of glory
See the day when men of good will
Live in peace live in peace again
Peace on earth can it be
Can it beI I will be king
And you you will be queen
Though nothing will drive them away
We can beat them just for one day
We can be heroes just for one day
And you you can be mean
And i Ill drink all the time
cause were lovers and that is a fact
Yes were lovers and that is that
Though nothing will keep us together
We could steal time just for one day
We can be heroes for ever and ever
What dyou say
Du
Koenntest du schwimmen
Wie delphine
Delphine es tun
Niemand gibt uns eine chance
Doch wir koennen siegen
Fuer immer und immer
Und wir sind dann helden
Fuer einen tag

Und du
Du koenigin
Obwohl sie
Unschlagbar scheinen
Werden wir helden
Fur einen tag
Wir sind dann wir
An diesem tag
Ich
Ich glaubbte zu traeumen zu traeumen
Die mauer
Im ruecken war kalt so kalt
Schuesse reissen die luft reissen die luft
Doch wir kuessen
Als ob nichts geschieht nichts geschieht
Und die scham fiel auf ihre seite
O wir koennen sie schlagen
Fuer alle zeiten
Dann sind wir helden
Nur diesen tag
Dann sind wir helden
Dann sind wir helden
Dann sind wir helden
Nur diesen tag
Dann sind wir helden

She played a good game of darts and the men slapped her back
And never took her out
She wore a trenchcoat khaki
Her hobnail boots were full of holes
Shes got medals
Her mother called her Mary but she changed her name to Tommy shes a one oh
She went and joined the army passed the medical
Dont ask me how its done
They sent her to the front line
Fighting for her countrys name
Shes got medals
She got very tired of picking up girls
Cleaning her gun and shaving her curls
Then the enemy dropped a bomb
Survivors there were none
People say that when the moon is full and all the stars have gone to bed
You can see her ghost but thats a lie because the naughty woman isnt dead
She deserted on the previous morning
Replaced her uniform with dresses silk and green
Called herself Eileen
Came to London town
Now shes settled down
Shes got medalsOh show me the way to the next whiskey bar

Un pensiero uno solo
Io cammino mentre dorme la cittÃ 
I soui occhi nella notte
Fanali bianchi nella notte
Una voce che mi parla chi sarÃ 
Dimmi ragazzo solo dove vai
PerchÃ tanto dolore
Hai perduto senza dubbio un grande amore
Ma di amori Ã tutta piena la cittÃ 
No ragazza sola no no no
Stavolta sei in errore
Non ho perso solamente un grande amore
Ieri sera ho perso tutto con lei
Con lei
I colori della vita
Lei
Cieli blu
Una come lei non la troverÃ² mai piÃ¹
Ora ragazzo solo dove andrai
La notte Ã un grande mare
Se ti serve la mia mano per nuotare
Grazie ma stasera io vorrei morire
PerchÃ sai negli occhi miei
CÃ un angelo un angelo
Che ormai non vola piÃ¹ che ormai non vola piÃ¹
Che ormai non vola piÃ¹
CÃ lei
I colori della vita
Lei
Cieli blu
Una come lei non la troverÃ² mai piÃ¹Wish I were a sailor crossing an azure sea
Under leaden skies under your eyes
But I cant see too far with these animal eyes
Cant hold my breath without your voice
An Im danger-prone Ill be bound
Ill be fast as hell without your touch
An Ill run run run run run
An Ill run run run run run without your love
Im a Goldman Im a soaring tower
And its cold in here without your love

The hand that wrote this letter
Sweeps the pillow clean
So rest your head and read a treasured dream
I care for no one else but you
I tear my soul to cease the pain
I think maybe you feel the same
What can we do
Im not quite sure what were supposed to do
So Ive been writing just for you
They say your life is going very well
They say you sparkle like a different girl
But something tells me that you hide
When all the world is warm and tired
You cry a little in the dark
Well so do i
Im not quite sure what youre supposed to say
But I can see its not okay
He makes you laugh
He brings you out in style
He treats you well
And makes you up real fine
And when hes strong
Hes strong for you
And when you kiss
Its something new
But did you ever call my name
Just by mistake
Im not quite sure what Im supposed to do
So Ill just write some love to you
Du du duuu du-du-du do-do-do do do doaoaoaaaaInstrumentalBaby you can own two hearts
Baby dont try to tear me apart
Someones got to go and I wont I wont
Thats a promise
Baby you cant fool around
Baby cant turn me upside down
Someones got to go and I wont I wont
Thats a promise
Its just a matter of time before you call him on the phone
Tell him please please leave him alone
Please leave him alone
Its just a matter of time call him on the phone
Tell him please please leave him alone
Please leave him alone
Baby youve got me used
Baby Cant you be like you
Someones got to go and I wont I wont
Thats a promise
Ad lib to endLucy I know what youre going to going to do
Oh Lucy look what youre doing Im doing it too
Now youre looking for God in exciting new ways
I say trust Him at once which is something these days
Lucy cant dance to the noise but she knows what the noise can do
Lucy cant dance to the noise but she knows what the noise can do
Did the world just explode
Dont recognize anyone
But youve still got me under your thumb
Lucy cant dance to the noise but she knows what the noise can do
Pursuing your frenzy in Ritz or Savoy
In this sexual noise vicious chords offer joy
You live and you die in the blink of an eye
Well I cant make you dance
Dance to the noise
Lucy cant dance but she knows what the noise can do
Dance to the noise
Lucy cant dance but she knows what the noise can do
Lucy I know what youre going to going to do
But you cant buy me off in this serial world
Who who who died and made you material girl
Lucy cant dance to the noise but she knows what the noise can do
So Ill spin while my lunatic lyric goes wrong
Guess Ill put all my eggs in a postmodern song
Lucy cant dance to the noise but she knows what the noise can do
Or this shallow orb mugged by reality
Just a few simple words like I love you I need you
Live and you die in the blink of an eye
Still I cant make you dance
Dance to the noise
Lucy cant dance but she knows what the noise can doInstrumentalBaby loves that way

Ricochet
Ricochet
The world is on a corner waiting for jobs
Ricochet
Ricochet
Turn the holy pictures so they face the wall
And who can bear to be forgotten
March of flowers march of dimes
These are the prisons these are the crimes
Men wait for news while thousands are still asleep
Dreaming of tramlines factories pieces of machinery
Mine shafts things like that
March of flowers march of dimes
These are the prisons these are the crimes
Sound of thunder sound of gold
Sound of the devil breaking parole
Ricochet its not the end of the world
Sound of thunder sound of gold
Sound of the devil breaking parole
Ricochet ricochet
These are the prisons these are the crimes
Teaching life in a violent new way
Ricochet ricochet
Turn the holy pictures so they face the wall
And who can bear to be forgotten
And who can bear to be forgotten
March of flowers march of dimes
These are the prisons these are the crimes
Early before the sun they struggle off to the gates
In their secret fearful places they see their lives
Unraveling before them
March of flowers march of dimes
These are the prisons these are the crimes
Sound of thunder sound of gold
Sound of the devil breaking parole
Ricochet its not the end of the world
But when they get home damp eyed and weary
They smile and crush their children to their heaving chests
Making unfulfillable promises
For who can bear to be forgottenColumbine my frail design
I see you see me standing on my own
Is it you that Im walking through
Should I retrace my point of view
Im left in clouded dreams of finding who
Not columbine
Just incase youre my disguise
I found yourself to my surprise
Im on the ground
And its harlequin who fix me up
Who catches you
Who wanishes me
From finding who
You areGunamn my sort of star we put you there
Youre all of us now youre all over town

Of the rose on your cheek the wounded and dumb
We stumble and fall we stumble and fall
Skin on skin but theres heaven in
Heavens in here
Heavens in here
Among the twilight and stars
Like a rocket to Mars
Heaven in here
The first and the last are telling it all
Telling you loud but selling it small
Im taking a swing at this shadow of mine
Crucifix hangs and my hearts in my mouth but its here
Heavens in here
Heavens in here
Among the twilight and stars
Like a rocket to Mars
Heaven in here
Heaven in one sigh heaven in two eyes
Heaven lies between your marbled thighs
The rustle of your falling gown
We stumble and fall like tragedy falls
We stumble and twirl theres heaven in here
We stumble and fall uncertain we fall
Flesh on flesh but theres heaven in
Heavens in here
Heavens in here
Heavens in here
Among the twilight and stars
Like a rocket to Mars
Heaven in here
Youll dance to my tongue
Well dance on the sun
Were the twilight and stars
Theres heaven in hereTheres no hold
The moving has come through
The danger passing you
Turns its face into the heat and runs the tunnels
Its so cold
The dark dug up by dogs
The stiches torn and broke
The raw meat fist you choke
Has hit the bloodlite
Glass traps open and close on
Night flights
Broken necks feather weights press the walls
Be my love we will be gods on night flights
With only one promise only one way to fall
Glass traps open and close on night flights
Broken necks feather weights press the walls
Be my love we will be gods on night flights
With only one promise only one way to call
On night flights
Only one way to fallListen baby let me lie low lie low with you
To be lie-high-high-high
High-high lie-low lie
Slowly its good and holy
Helping one another just a righteous brother
Lifetime give me back my lifetime
I dont want to be an angel just a little bit evil
Feel the devil in me
Holy holy
Hold on to anyone hold on to anyone
But just let me be
Holy holy
Hold on to anyone hold on to anyone
But let go of me
Listen baby let me lie low lie low with you
To be a lie-high-high-high
High-high my oh my
Holy holy
Hold on to anyone hold on to anyone
But just let me be
Holy holy
Hold on to anyone hold on to anyone
But let go of meGod is on top of it all
And thats all it is
We are praying
Athena Athena
Athena AthenaFingertip sun at sideshow stalls they throw the balls
At coconut fur that hides behind coloured shades that blind your eyes
Every childs mother holds an ice-cream cone they circle round
Perceived unknown by an eye that peers from a hole in the tent where no one goes
A figure sitting cross-legged on the floor hes clogged and clothed in saffron robes
His beads are all he owns
Slow down slow down
Someone must have said that slow him down
Slow down slow down
Its pictured on the arms of the karma man
Fairy tale skin depicting scenes from human zoos
Impermanent toys like peace and war a gentle face youve seen before
Karma man tattooed on your side the wheel of life
I see my times and who Ive been I only live now and I dont know why
I struggle hard to take these pictures in but
All my friends can see is just the pinkness of his skin
Slow down slow down
Someone must have said that slowed him down
Slow down slow down
Its pictured on the arms of the karma manJust when Im ready to throw in my hand
Just when the best things in life are gone
I look into your eyes uh uh
Theres no smoke without fire uh uh
Youre exactly who I want to be with uh uh
Without you
What would I do
And when Im willing to call it a day
Just when I wont take another chance
I hold your hand uh uh
Theres no smoke without fire uh uh
Woman I love you uh uh
Without you
What would I doNow Not tomorrow
Yesterday
Not tomorrow
It happens today
The damage today
They fall on today
They beat on the outside
And Ill stand by you
Now Not tomorrow
Its happening now
Not tomorrow
Its happening now
The crazed in the hot-zone
The mental and divas hands
The fisting of life
To the music outside
To the music outside
It happens outside
The music is outside
Its happening outside
The music is outside
Its happening now
Not tomorrow
Yesterday
Not tomorrow
The music is outside

A winters day a bitter snowflake on my face
My summer girl takes little backward steps away
Jack Frost took her hand and left me Jack Frost aint so cool
Sell me a coat with buttons of silver
Sell me a coat thats red or gold
Sell me a coat with little patch pockets
Sell me a coat cause I feel cold
And when she smiles the ice forgets to melt away
Not like before her smile was warming yesterday
See the trees like silver candy feel my icy hand
Sell me a coat with buttons of silver
Sell me a coat thats red or gold
Sell me a coat with little patch pockets
Sell me a coat cause I feel cold
See my eyes my window pane
See my tears like gentle rain
Thats the memory of a summer day
Sell me a coat with buttons of silver
Sell me a coat thats red or gold
Sell me a coat with little patch pockets
Sell me a coat cause I feel cold
Sell me a coat with buttons of silver
Sell me a coat thats red or gold
Sell me a coat with little patch pockets
Sell me a coat cause I feel cold
La la la la la laIm lazy
Youre crazy girl
Stay by my side
Im scared youll
Meet someone
In whom youll confide
Chorus
Lifes still a dream
Your loves amazing
Since I found you
My lifes amazing
I pledge you
Youll never be blue
Theres too much at stake to be down
My nightmare
Rooted here watching you go
Divine in both our lives
Chorus
My lifes a roll
Go go go
And its amazingDay after day
They send my friends away
To mansions cold and grey
To the far side of town
Where the thin men stalk the streets
While the sane stay underground
Day after day
They tell me I can go
They tell me I can blow
To the far side of town
Where its pointless to be high
Cause its such a long way down
So I tell them that
I can fly I will scream I will break my arm
I will do me harm
Here I stand foot in hand talking to my wall
Im not quite right at all am I
Dont set me free Im as heavy as can be
Just my librium and me
And my EST makes three
Cause Id rather stay here
With all the madmen
Than perish with the sad men roaming free
And Id rather play here
With all the madmen
For Im quite content theyre all as sane
As me
Where can the horizon lie
When a nation hides
Its organic minds
In a cellar dark and grim
They must be very dim
Day after day
They take some brain away
Then turn my face around
To the far side of town
And tell me that its real
Then ask me how I feel
Here I stand foot in hand talking to my wall
Im not quite right at all
Dont set me free Im as helpless as can be
My libidos split on me
Gimme some good ole lobotomy
Cause Id rather stay here
With all the madmen
Than perish with the sad men
Roaming free
And Id rather play here
With all the madmen
For Im quite content
Theyre all as sane as me

Theres no room for anger were all very small oh by jingo
Were painting our faces and dressing in thoughts from the skies from paradise
But they think that were holding a secretive ball
Wont someone invite them
Theyre just taller children ooh thats all after all
Man is an obstacle sad as the clown oh by jingo
So hold on to nothing and he wont let you down oh by jingo
Some people are marching together and some on their own
Quite alone
Others are running the smaller ones crawl
But some sit in silence theyre just older children
Thats all after all
I sing with impertinence shading impermanent chords
With my words
Ive borrowed your time and Im sorry I called
But the thought just occurred that were nobodys children at all after all
Live your rebirth and do what you will oh by jingo
Forget all Ive said please bear me no ill oh by jingo
After all after allI count the corpses on my left I find Im not so tidy
So I better get away better make it today
Ive cut twenty-three down since Friday
But I cant control it my face is drawn
My instinct still emotes it
I slash them cold I kill them dead
I broke the gooks I cracked their heads
Ill bomb them out from under the beds
But now Ive got the running gun blues
It seems the peacefuls stopped the war
Left generals squashed and stifled
But Ill slip out again tonight
Cause they havent taken back my rifle
For I promote oblivion
And Ill plug a few civilians
Ill slash them cold Ill kill them dead
Ill break them gooks Ill crack their heads
Ill slice them till theyre running red
But now Ive got the running gun blues
Ill slash them cold Ill kill them dead
Ill break them gooks Ill crack their heads
Ill slice them till theyre running red
But now Ive got the running gun blues
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh oohPresident Joe once had a dream
The world held his hand gave their pledge
So he told them his scheme for a savior machine
They called it the Prayer its answer was law
Its logic stopped war gave them food
How they adored till it cried in its boredom
Please dont believe in me please disagree with me
Life is too easy a plague seems quite feasible now
Or maybe a war or I may kill you all
Dont let me stay dont let me stay
My logic says burn so send me away
Your minds are too green I despise all Ive seen
You cant stake your lives on a savior machine
I need you flying and Ill show that dying
Is living beyond reason sacred dimension of time
I perceive every sign I can steal every mind
Dont let me stay dont let me stay
My logic says burn so send me away
Your minds are too green I despise all Ive seen
You cant stake your lives on a savior machineWe met upon a hill the night was cool and still
She sucked my dormant will
Mother she blew my brain I will go back again
My god she shook me cold
I had no time to spare I grabbed her golden hair
And threw her to the ground
Father she craved my head oh lord the things she said
My god she should be told
I was very smart
Broke the gentle hearts of many young virgins
I was quick on the ball left them so lonely
Theyd just give up trying
Then she took my head smashed it up
Kept my young blood rising
Crushed me mercilessly kept me going around
So she dont know I crave her so-o-o
Ill give my love in vain to reach that peak again
We met upon a hill
Mother she blew my brain I will go back again
My god she shook me coldWhen all the world was very young
And mountain magic heavy hung
The supermen would walk in file
Guardians of a loveless isle
And gloomy browed with super fear their tragic endless lives
Heaves nor sighs in solemn perverse serenity
wondrous beings chained to life
Strange games they would play then
No death for the perfect men
Life rolls into one for them
So softly a super god cries
Where all were minds in uni-thought
Power is weird by mystics taught
No pain no joy no power too great
Colossal strength to grasp a fate
Where sad-eyed mermen tossed in slumbers
Nightmare dreams no mortal mind could hold
A man would tear his brothers flesh a chance to die
To turn to mold
Far out in the red-sky
Far out from the sad eyes
Strange mad celebration
So softly a super god criesIn the corner of the morning in the past
I would sit and blame the master first and last
All the roads were straight and narrow
And the prayers were small and yellow
And the rumour spread that I was aging fast
Then I ran across a monster who was sleeping
By a tree
And I looked and frowned and the monster was me
Well I said hello and I said hello
And I asked why not and I replied I dont know
So we asked a simple black bird who was happy as can be
And he laughed insane and quipped Kahlil Gibran
And I cried for all the others till the day was nearly through
For I realized that Gods a young man too
Ho
Oh I said so long and I waved bye-bye
And I smashed my soul and traded my mind
Got laid by a young bordello
Who was vaguely half asleep
For which my reputation swept back home in drag
And the moral of this magic spell
Negotiates my hide
When God did take my logic for a ride
Riding along
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
He swallowed his pride and puckered his lips
And showed me the leather belt round his hips
My knees were shaking my cheeks aflame
He said youll never go down to the Gods again
Turn around go back
He struck the ground a cavern appeared
And I smelt the burning pit of fear
We crashed a thousand yards below
I said do it again do it again
Turn around go back
His nebulous body swayed above
His tongue swollen with devils love
The snake and I a venom high
I said do it again do it again
Turn around go back
Breathe breathe breathe deeply
And I was seething breathing deeply
Spitting sentry horned and tailed
Waiting for you oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh ohWe passed upon the stair
We spoke of was and when
Although I wasnt there
He said I was his friend
Which came as some surprise
I spoke into his eyes
I thought you died alone
A long long time ago
Oh no not me
I never lost control
Youre face to face
With the man who sold the world
I laughed and shook his hand
And made my way back home
I searched for form and land
For years and years I roamed
I gazed a gazley stare
At all the millions here
We must have died alone
A long long time ago
Who knows
Not me
We never lost control
Youre face to face
With the man who sold the worldDont look down
Theyre making sorta crazy sounds
Dont look down no
Dont know who else came to kneel
On this empty battlefield
But when I hear that crazy sound I dont look down
From Central Park to shanty town
I always hear that crazy sound
From New York to shanty town
Theres always something else
Dont look down no
I went this morning to the cemetery
To see old Rudy Valentino buried
Lipstick traces on his name
He never looked down
Cause they were making crazy sounds sound
From Central park to shanty town
He always heard that crazy sound
Theres always something else
Dont look down dont look down no
When I see you standing there
I cant see the clothes you wear

From New York to shanty town

Theres always something else
Dont look down dont look down dont look down

Youll never need to doubt it

Youre so surprised he dont run to catch your ash
Everybody always wants to kiss your trash

Nobody can
Now that he knows

On the neighborhood threat
Somewhere a babys bleeding
Somewhere a mothers needing

I keep forgetting you dont love me no more
I keep forgetting that you told me that you
Didnt want me around any more
But these stupid old feet
Just head for your street
Like theyve done so many times before
And this stubborn old fist
On the end of my wrist
Keeps a knocking on your front door
I keep forgetting you dont love me no more
I keep forgetting you dont love me no more
I keep forgetting bout those heartbreaking nights
And those heartbreaking things
That you said
Though I know in my heart
Were drifting apart
I cant believe that our love is dead
Though its plain as can be
That youre finished with me
I just cant get it through my head
I keep forgetting you dont love me no more
I keep forgetting you dont want me no more
I keep forgetting you dont want me no more
Though I know in my heart
Were drifting apart
I cant believe that our love is dead
Though its plain as can be
That youre finished with me
I just cant get it through my headIve seen the city
I took the next flight
For Borneo
They say its pretty
I like the tee shirts
In Borneo
Some wear Bob Marley
Others in playboy
Or Duvalier
Make the last plane come
Let me rise through the cloudy above
With a book on Borneo
Strangers come and go
Its such a waste of time
Problems far behind
Another day
But even in springtime
Its a rich slice of life
So send me a letter
Ill reply with a broken spear
That dusky mulatto
In nylons and tattoos
Hot juice in coke bottles
We dance in the sand
Well they twirl and they tumble
Yes they twirl and they tumble
Well Ill twirl and Ill tumble
Ive been to Leons
Hes got nine daughters
And a stereo
They say that Leon
Watches from the tree tops
In Borneo
When the road is mud
Everything stops with a thud
Thats the way it goes way down
Yonder in Borneo
Far beneath his mansion
Theres an open drain
Sending all the sewage down the hill
But when the general shows movies
No one hesitates
To sneak from the jungle
They laugh and they mumble
Enjoying the show
And that dusky mulatto
Hot juice in coke bottles
In blue jeans and tattoos
Well they twirl and they tumble
Yes they twirl and they tumble
Well Ill twirl and Ill tumble
I like the free world
They say its pretty
This time of year
They tumble and twirl
They tumble and twirl
Ill tumble and twirl
They twirl and they tumble
I like the free world
I like the free world
They say its pretty
This time of year
This time of yearSomethings going on in society
Dancing with the big boys
You chew your fingers and stare at the floor
Dancing with the big boys
One wrong word and youre out of sync
Talking bout a hands on policy
Big boys
Death to the trees
Dancing with the big boys
They werent bad they werent brave
Nothing is embarrassing
Dancing with the big boys
There are too many people too much belief
Dancing with the big boys
Where theres trouble theres poetry
Dancing with the big boys
Your family is a football team
Big boys
This dot marks your location
Dancing with the big boys
Loneliness in a free society
Dancing with the big boys
Big boys
This can be embarrassing
Big boys
Dancing with the big boys
Dancing with the big boysWatching them come and go
The Templars and the Saracens
Theyre traveling the holy land
Opening telegrams
Torture comes and torture goes
Knights whod give you anything
They bear the cross of Coeur de Leon
Salvation for the mirror blind
But if you pray all your sins are hooked upon the sky
Pray and the heathen lie will disappear
Prayers they hide the saddest view
Believing the strangest things loving the alien
And your prayers they break the sky in two
Believing the strangest things loving the alien
You pray til the break of dawn
Believing the strangest things loving the alien
And youll believe youre loving the alien
Believing the strangest things loving the alien
Thinking of a different time
Palestine a modern problem
Bounty and your wealth in land
Terror in a best laid plan
Watching them come and go
Tomorrows and the yesterdays
Christians and the unbelievers
Hanging by the cross and nailEverything will be alright tonight
Everything will be alright tonight
No one moves
No one talks
No one thinks
No one walks tonight
Everyone will be alright tonight
Everyone will be alright tonight
No one moves
No one talks
No one thinks
No one walks tonight
Tonight
I am gonna love you till the end
I will love you till I reach the end
I will love her till I die
I will see you in the sky
Tonight
Tonight
Everything will be alright tonight
Everything will be alright tonight
No one moves
No one talks
No one thinks
No one walks tonight
Tonight
Tonight

TonightI staggered through this criminal reign
Im not in love no phony pain
Creeping through this tidal wave
No warm embrace just a lovers grain
This symphony
This rage in me
Ive got a handful of songs to sing
To sting your soul
To fuck you over
This furious reign
Im falling man
Im choking man
Im fading man
And broke and blind
Im falling man
Im choking man
Im fading man
Just killing a little time
I love the sound of an empty room
The screams of night the end of love
Two beating hearts one labored scarred
One open wound wasted and drowned
No sympathy
This furious reign
I lay in bed
The monster fed the body bled
I turned and said
I get some of you all the time
All of you some other time
This rage in me
Get away from me
Im falling man
Im choking man
Im fading man
And broke and blind
Im falling man
Im choking man
Im fading man
Just killing a little timeIts safe in the city to love in a doorway
To wrangle some screams from the dawn
And isnt it me putting pain in a stranger
Like a portrait in flesh who trails on a leash
Will you see that Im scared and Im lonely
So Ill break up my room and yawn and I
Run to the center of things
Where the knowing one says
Boys Boys its a sweet thing
Boys Boys its a sweet thing sweet thing
If you want it Boys get it here thing
Cause hope Boys is a cheap thing cheap thing
Im glad that youre older than me
Makes me feel important and free
Does that make you smile isnt that me
Im in your way and Ill steal every moment
If this trade is a curse then Ill bless you
And turn to the crossroads of Hamburg as in
Boys Boys its a sweet thing
Boys Boys its a sweet thing sweet thing
If you want it Boys get it here thing
Cause hope Boys is a cheap thing cheap thing
Part Two Candidate
Ill make you a deal like any other candidate
Well pretend were walking home cause your futures at stake
My set is amazing it even smells like a street
Theres a bar at the end where I can meet you and your friend
Someone scrawled on the wall I smell the blood of Les Tricoteuses
Who wrote up scandals in other bars
Im having so much fun with the poisonous people
Spreading rumors and lies and stories they made up
Some make you sing and some make you scream
One makes you wish that youd never been seen
But theres a shop on the corner thats selling papier mache
Making bullet-proof faces Charlie Manson Cassius Clay
If you want it Boys get it here thing
So you scream out of line
I want you I need you Anyone out there Any time
Tres butch little number whines Hey dirty I want you
When its good its really good and when its bad I go to pieces
If you want it Boys get it here thing
Well on the street where you live I could not hold up my head
For I put all I have in another bed
On another floor in the back of a car
In the cellar of a church with the door ajar
Well I guess we must be looking for a different kind
But we cant stop trying til we break up our minds
Til the sun drips blood on the seedy young knights
Who press you on the ground while shaking in fright
I guess we could cruise down one more time
With you by my side it should be fine
Well buy some drugs and watch a band
Then jump in the river holding hands
Part Three Sweet Thing Reprise
If you want it boys get it here thing
Cause hope boys is a cheap thing cheap thing
Is it nice in your snow storm freezing your brain
Do you think that your face looks the same
Then let it be its all I ever wanted
Its a street with a deal and a taste
Its got claws its got me its got you N obokov is sun-licked now
Upon the beach at Gruenwald
Brilliant and naked just
The way that authors looks
Clare and Lady Manners drink
Until the other cows go home
Gossip till their lips are bleeding
Politics and all
Id rather be high Id rather be high
Id rather be flying Id rather be flying
Id rather be dead or out of my head
Than training these guns on those men in the sand
Id rather be high
The Thames was black the tower dark
I flew to Cairo find my regiment
Citys full of generals
And generals full of shit
I stumble to the graveyard and I
Lay down by my parents whisper
Just remember duckies
Everybody gets got
Id rather be high Id rather be high
Id rather be flying Id rather be flying
Id rather be dead or out of my head
Than training these guns of those men in the sand

Im so afraid that I will lose it
Id rather smoke and phone my ex
Be pleading for some teenage sex yeah
Id rather be high Id rather be high

Than training these guns on the men in the sand
Id rather be high Id rather be high

You pull on your finger then another finger then your cigarette
The wall to wall is calling it lingers then you forget
Ohhh youre a rock n roll suicide
Youre too old to lose it too young to choose it
And the clock waits so patiently on your song
You walk past a cafe but you dont eat when youve lived too long
Oh no no no youre a rock n roll suicide
Chev brakes are snarling as you stumble across the road
But the day breaks instead so you hurry home
Dont let the sun blast your shadow
Dont let the milk float ride your mind
Youre so natural religiously unkind
Oh no love Youre not alone
Youre watching yourself but youre too unfair
You got your head all tangled up
But if I could only make you care
Oh no love Youre not alone
No matter what or who youve been
No matter when or where youve seen
All the knives seem to lacerate your brain
Ive had my share Ill help you with the pain
Youre not alone
Just turn on with me and youre not alone
Lets turn on with me and youre not alone
Gimme your hands cause youre wonderful
Gimme your hands cause youre wonderful
Oh gimme your handsIts the darkest hour youre twenty-two
The voice of youth the hour of dread
Its the darkest hour and your voice is new
Love is lost and lost is love
Your countrys new your friends are new
Your house and even your eyes are new
Your maid is new and your accent too
But your fear is as old as the world
Say goodbye to the thrills of life
When love was good when love was bad
Wave goodbye to the life without pain
Say hello your beautiful girl
Say hello to the greater men
Tell them your secrets theyre like the grave
Oh what have you done oh what have you done
Love is lost lost is love
You know so much its making you cry
You refuse to talk but you think like mad
Youve cut out your zone and the things have fold
Oh what have you done oh what have you done
Oh what have you done oh what have you doneWhen Im five
I will wash my face me hands all by myself
When Im five
I will chew and spit tabacco like my grandfather jones
cause Im only four and five is far away
When Im five
I will read the magazines in mummys drawer
When Im five
I will walk behind the soldiers in the may day parade
cause Im only four and grown-ups walk too fast
Yesterday was horrid day cause raymond kicked my shin
And mummy says if I am good shell let me go to school in August
Daddy shouted loud at mummy and I dropped my toast at breakfast
And I laughed when bonzo licked my face because it tickled
I wonder why my daddy cries and how I wish that I was nearly five
When Im five
I will catch a butterfly and eat it and I wont be sick
When Im five
I will jump in puddles laugh in church and marry my mum
And Ill let my daddy do the washing-up
If I close one eye the people on that side cant see me
I get headaches in the morning and I rode on freddies tricycle
And everywhere was funny when I ran down to the sweetshop
Then I fell and bleeded-up my knee and everybody soppied me
I saw a photograph of jesus and I asked him if hed make me five
I saw a photograph of jesus and I asked him if hed make me five
When Im five
When Im five
When Im oahLittle fat man who sold his soul
Little fat man who sold his dream
Pathetic little fat man
No ones bloody laughing
The clown that no one laughs at
They all just wish hed die
Hes so depressed at being hated
Fatso takes his own life
He blows his stupid brains out
But the twat would probably miss
He sold his soul for a shot at fame
Catchphrase and wigs and the jokes are lame
Hes got no style hes got no grace
Hes banal and facile hes a fat waste of spaceAnd so the story goes they wore the clothes
They said the things to make it seem improbable
Whale of a lie like they hope it was
And the good men tomorrow had their feet in the wallow
And their heads of brawn were nicer shorn
And how they bought their positions with saccharin and trust
And the world was asleep to our latent fuss
Sighings swirl through the streets like the crust of the sun the Bewlay Brothers
In our wings that bark
Flashing teeth of brass
Standing tall in the dark
Oh and we were gone
Hanging out with your dwarf men
We were so turned on
By your lack of conclusions
I was stone and he was wax so he could scream and still relax
Unbelievable
And we frightened the small children away
And our talk was old and dust would flow
Through our veins and though it was midnight back at the kitchen door
Like the grim face on the cathedral floor
The solid book we wrote cannot be found today
And it was stalking time for the moon boys the Bewlay Brothers
With our backs on the arch
And if the Devil may be here
But he cant sing about that
Oh and we were gone
Real cool traders
We were so turned on
You thought we were fakers
And now the dress is hung the ticket pawned
The factor max that proved the fact is melted down
Woven on the edging of my pillow
And my brother lays upon the rocks
He could be dead he could be not he could be you
Hes chameleon comedian Corinthian and caricature
Shooting up pie in the sky
Bewlay brothers
In the feeble in the bad
Bewlay brothers
In the blessed and cold
In the crutch-hungry dark
Was where we flayed our mark
Oh and we were gone
Kings of Oblivion
We were so turned on
In the night walk pavilion
Lay me place and bake me pie Im starving for me gravy
Leave my shoes and door unlocked I might just slip away
Just for the day ay
Please come away ay
Just for the day ay
Please come away ay
Please come away ay
Just for the day ay
Please come away ay
Please come away ay
Please come away ay
Please come away ay
Away
AwayOh hear this Robert Zimmerman
I wrote a song for you
About a strange young man called Dylan
With a voice like sand and glue
Some words had truthful vengeance
That could pin us to the floor
Brought a few more people on
And put the fear in a whole lot more
Ah here she comes
Here she comes here she comes again
The same old painted lady
From the brow of the superbrain
Shell scratch this world to pieces
As she comes on like a friend
Couple of songs from your old scrapbook
Could send her home again
Gave your heart to every bedsit room at least a
Picture on my wall
And you sat behind a million pair of eyes
And told them how they saw
Then we lost your train of thought
Your paintings are all your own
While troubles are rising wed rather be scared
Together than alone
Ah here she comes
Here she comes here she comes again
The same old painted lady
From the brow of the superbrain
Shell scratch this world to pieces
As she comes on like a friend
But a couple of songs from your old scrapbook
Could send her home again
Now hear this Robert Zimmerman
Though I dont suppose well meet
Ask your good friend Dylan
If hed gaze a while down the old street
Tell him weve lost his poems
So were writing on the walls
Give us back our unity
Give us back our family
Youre every nations refugee
Dont leave us with their sanity
Ah here she comes
Here she comes here she comes again
The same old painted lady
From the brow of the superbrain
Shell scratch this world to pieces
As she comes on like a friend
But a couple of songs from your old scrapbook
Could send her home again
Ah couple of songs from your old scrapbook
Could send her home again
Oh here she comes
Here she comes and here she comesIts a God-awful small affair
To the girl with the mousy hair
But her mummy is yelling no
And her daddy has told her to go
But her friend is nowhere to be seen
Now she walks through her sunken dream
To the seat with the clearest view
And shes hooked to the silver screen
But the film is a saddening bore
For shes lived it ten times or more
She could spit in the eyes of fools
As they ask her to focus on
Sailors fighting in the dance hall
Oh man look at those cavemen go
Its the freakiest show
Take a look at the lawman
Beating up the wrong guy
Oh man wonder if hell ever know
Hes in the best selling show
Is there life on Mars
Its on Americas tortured brow
That Mickey Mouse has grown up a cow
Now the workers have struck for fame
Cause Lennons on sale again
See the mice in their million hordes
From Ibiza to the Norfolk Broads
Rule Britannia is out of bounds
To my mother my dog and clowns
But the film is a saddening bore
Cause I wrote it ten times or more
Its about to be writ again
As I ask you to focus on
Sailors fighting in the dance hall
Oh man look at those cavemen go
Its the freakiest show
Take a look at the lawman
Beating up the wrong guy
Oh man wonder if hell ever know
Hes in the best selling show
Is there life on MarsOh yeah
Mmm
Still dont know what I was waitin for
And my time was runnin wild
A million dead end streets and
Every time I thought Id got it made
It seemed the taste was not so sweet
So I turned myself to face me
But Ive never caught a glimpse
How the others must see the faker
Im much too fast to take that test
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Dont want to be a richer man
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Theres gonna have to be a different man
Time may change me
But I cant trace time
Mmm yeah
I watch the ripples change their size
But never leave the stream
Of warm impermanence
And so the days float through my eyes
But still the days seem the same
And these children that you spit on
As they try to change their worlds
Are immune to your consultations
Theyre quite aware of what theyre goin through
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Dont tell them to grow up and out of it
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Wheres your shame
Youve left us up to our necks in it
Time may change me
But you cant trace time
Strange fascinations fascinate me
Ah changes are takin
The pace Im goin through
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Ooh look out you rock n rollers
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Pretty soon now youre gonna get older
Time may change me
But I cant trace time
I said that time may change me
But I cant trace timeLike to take a cement fix
Be a standing cinema
Dress my friends up just for show
See them as they really are
Put a peephole in my brain
Two New Pence to have a go
Id like to be a gallery
Put you all inside my show
Andy Warhol looks a scream
Hang him on my wall
Andy Warhol Silver Screen
Cant tell them apart at all
Andy walking Andy tired
Andy take a little snooze
Tie him up when hes fast asleep
Send him on a pleasant cruise
When he wake up on the sea
He sure to think of me and you
Hell think about paint and hell think about glue
What a jolly boring thing to do
Andy Warhol looks a scream
Hang him on my wall
Andy Warhol Silver Screen
Cant tell them apart at allThe tactful cactus by your window
Surveys the prairie of your room
The mobile spins to its collision
Clara puts her head between her paws
Theyve opened shops down the West side
Will all the cacti find a home
But the key to the city
Is in the sun that pins
The branches to the sky oh oh ohWill you stay in our lovers story
If you stay you wont be sorry
Cause we believe in you
Soon youll grow so take a chance
With a couple of Kooks
Hung up on romancing
Will you stay in our lovers story
If you stay you wont be sorry
Cause we believe in you
Soon youll grow so take a chance
With a couple of Kooks
Hung up on romancing
We bought a lot of things
To keep you warm and dry
And a funny old crib on which the paint wont dry
I bought you a pair of shoes
A trumpet you can blow
And a book of rules
On what to say to people
When they pick on you
Cause if you stay with us youre gonna be pretty Kookie too
Will you stay in our lovers story
If you stay you wont be sorry
Cause we believe in you
Soon youll grow so take a chance
With a couple of Kooks
Hung up on romancing
And if you ever have to go to school
Remember how they messed up
This old fool
Dont pick fights with the bullies or the cads
Cause Im not much cop at punching other peoples Dads
And if the homework brings you down
Then well throw it on the fire
And take the car downtown
Will you stay in our lovers story
If you stay you wont be sorry
Cause we believe in you
Soon youll grow so take a chance
With a couple of Kooks
Hung up on romancing
Will you stay in our lovers story
If you stay you wont be sorry
Cause we believe in you
Soon youll grow so take a chance
With a couple of Kooks
Hung up on romancingIm closer to the Golden Dawn
Immersed in Crowleys uniform
Of imagery
Im living in a silent film
Portraying Himmlers sacred realm
Of dream reality
Im frightened by the total goal
Drawing to the ragged hole
And I aint got the power anymore
No I aint got the power anymore
Im the twisted name on Garbos eyes
Living proof of Churchills lies Im destiny
Im torn between the light and dark
Where others see their targets divine symmetry
Should I kiss the vipers fang
Or herald loud the death of Man
Im sinking in the quicksand of my thought
And I aint got the power anymore
Dont believe in yourself dont deceive with belief
Knowledge comes with deaths release
Aah-aah aah-aah aah-aah aah-aah
Im not a prophet or a stone-age man
Just a mortal with the potential of a superman
Im living on
Im tethered to the logic of Homo Sapien
Cant take my eyes from the great salvation
Of bullshit faith
If I dont explain what you ought to know
You can tell me all about it on the next Bardo
Im sinking in the quicksand of my thought
And I aint got the power anymore
Dont believe in yourself dont deceive with belief
Knowledge comes with deaths release
Aah-aah aah-aah aah-aah aah-aah
Dont believe in yourself dont deceive with belief
Knowledge comes with deaths release
Aah-aah aah-aah aah-aah aah-aahWake up you sleepy head
Put on some clothes shake up your bed
Put another log on the fire for me
Ive made some breakfast and coffee
Look out my window and what do I see
A crack in the sky and a hand reaching down to me
All the nightmares came today
And it looks as though theyre here to stay
What are we coming to
No room for me no fun for you
I think about a world to come
Where the books were found by the Golden ones
Written in pain written in awe
By a puzzled man who questioned
What we were here for
All the strangers came today
And it looks as though theyre here to stay
Oh you Pretty Things
Dont you know youre driving your
Mamas and Papas insane
Oh you Pretty Things
Dont you know youre driving your
Mamas and Papas insane
Let me make it plain
You gotta make way for the Homo Superior
Look out at your children
See their faces in golden rays
Dont kid yourself they belong to you
Theyre the start of a coming race
The earth is a bitch
Weve finished our news
Homo Sapiens have outgrown their use
All the strangers came today
And it looks as though theyre here to stayOh yeah
Im up on the eleventh floor and Im watching the cruisers below
Hes down on the street and hes trying hard to pull sister Flo
Oh my hearts in the basement my weekends at an all-time low
Cause shes hoping to score so I cant see her letting him go
Walk out of her heart walk out of her mind oh not her
Shes so swishy in her satin and tat
In her frock coat and bipperty-bopperty hat
Oh God I could do better than that
Shes an old-time ambassador of sweet-talking night-walking games
And shes known in the darkest clubs for pushing ahead of the dames
If she says she can do it then she can do it she dont make false claims
But shes a queen and such are queens that your laughter is sucked in their brains
Now shes leading him on and shell lay him right down
Yes shes leading him on and shell lay him right down
But it could have been me yes it could have been me
Why didnt I say why didnt I say no no no
Shes so swishy in her satin and tat
In her frock coat and bipperty-bopperty hat
Oh God I could do better than that
So I lay down a while and I gaze at my hotel wall
Oh the cot is so cold it dont feel like no bed at all
Yeah I lay down a while and I look at my hotel wall
And hes down on the street so I throw both his bags down the hall
And Im phoning a cab cause my stomach feels small
Theres a taste in my mouth and its no taste at all
It could have been me oh yeah it could have been me
Why didnt I say why didnt I say no no no
Shes so swishy in her satin and tat
In her frock coat and bipperty-bopperty hat
Oh God I could do better than that
You betcha
Oh yeah
Uh-huhFill your heart with love today
Dont play the game of time
Things that happened in the past
Only happened in your mind only in your mind
Oh forget your mind and youll be free yeah
The writings on the wall
Free yeah and you can know it all
If you choose
Just remember lovers never lose
Cause they are free of thoughts unpure
And of thoughts unkind
Gentleness clears the soul
Love cleans the mind and makes it free
Oh happiness is happening
Dragons have been bled
Gentleness is everywhere
Fears just in your head only in your head
Fear is in your head only in your head
So forget your head and youll be free
The writings on the wall
Free yeah and you can know it all
If you choose
Just remember lovers never lose
Cause they are free of thoughts unpure
And of thoughts unkind
Gentleness clears the soul
Love will clean your mind and makes you free
Free yeah yeah-yeah-yeah yeah-yeah-yeah

Thats the color of my room where I will live
Mmm mmm mmm mmm

Pale blinds drawn all day
Nothing to do nothing to say

Waiting for the gift of sound and vision
And I will sing and inaudible
Waiting for the gift of sound and vision
Drifting into my solitude over my head

I take it on the road
Those kilometers and the red lights
I was always looking left and right
Oh but Im
Always crashing in the same car
Jasmine I saw you peeping
As I pushed my foot down to the floor
I was going round and round
The hotel garage
Must have been touching close to ninety-four
Oh but Im
Always crashing in the same carInstrumentalInstrumentalMmmm-mm-mm-ommm

Though nothing nothing will keep us together
We can beat them forever and ever

I I will be King
And you you will be Queen
Though nothing will drive them away
We can be heroes just for one day
We can be us just for one day
I I can remember
I remember
Standing by the wall
By the wall
And the guns shot above our heads
Over our heads
And we kissed as though nothing could fall
Nothing could fall
And the shame was on the other side
Oh we can beat them forever and ever
Then we could be heroes just for one day
We can be heroes
We can be heroes
We can be heroes just for one day
We can be heroesSons of the silent age
Stand on platforms blank looks and notebooks
Sit in back rows of city limits
Lay in bed coming and going on easy terms
Sons of the silent age
Pace their rooms like a cells dimensions
Rise for a year or two then make war
Search through their one-inch thoughts
Then decide it couldnt be done
Baby Ill never let you go
All I see is all I know
Lets take another way down sons of sound and sons of sound
Baby baby Ill never let you down
I cant stand another sound
Lets fin another way in sons of sound and sons of sound
Sons of the silent age
Listen to tracks by Sam Therapy and King Dice
Sons of the silent age
Pick up in bars and cry only once
Sons of the silent age
Make love only once but dream and dream
Dont walk they just glide in and out of life
They never die they just go to sleep one day
Baby I wont ever let you go
All I see is all I know
Lets take another way down sons of sound and sons of sound
Oh baby baby baby I wont ever let you down
I cant stand another sound
Lets find another way in sons of sound and sons of sound
Sons of sound and sons of sound baby baby baby

And tell that youre eighty but brother you wont care
Youll be shooting up on anything tomorrows never there
Beware the savage jaw
Of one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four
Come see come see remember me

Your lips cut a smile on your face
Your scalding face to the cage to the cage
She was a beauty in a cage
Too too high a price
To drink rotting wine from your hands
Your fearful hands get me to a doctors Ive been told
Someones back in town the chips are down
I just cut and blackout
Im under Japanese influence and my honors at stake
The weathers grim ice on the cages

Panthers are steaming stalking screaming

I will take that plane tonight
Ive nothing to lose nothing to gain
Ill kiss you in the rain
Kiss you in the rain kiss you in the rain
Kiss you in the rain kiss you in the rain
In the rain in the rain

Get some direction
Hot air gets me into a blackout

You pull on your finger then another finger then your cigarette
The wall to wall is calling it lingers then you forget
Ohhh youre a rock n roll suicide
Youre too old to lose it too young to choose it
And the clock waits so patiently on your song
You walk past a cafe but you dont eat when youve lived too long
Oh no no no youre a rock n roll suicide
Chev brakes are snarling as you stumble across the road
But the day breaks instead so you hurry home
Dont let the sun blast your shadow
Dont let the milk float ride your mind
Youre so natural religiously unkind
Oh no love Youre not alone
Youre watching yourself but youre too unfair
You got your head all tangled up
But if I could only make you care
Oh no love Youre not alone
No matter what or who youve been
No matter when or where youve seen
All the knives seem to lacerate your brain
Ive had my share Ill help you with the pain
Youre not alone
Just turn on with me and youre not alone
Lets turn on with me and youre not alone
Gimme your hands cause youre wonderful
Gimme your hands cause youre wonderful
Oh gimme your handsStone love she kneels before the grave
A brave son who gave his life
To save the slogans
That hovers between the headstone and her eyes
For they penetrate her grieving
New love a boy and girl are talking
New words that only they can share in
New words a love so strong it tears their hearts
To sleep through the fleeting hours of morning
Love is careless in its choosing
Sweeping over cross a baby
Love descends on those defenseless
Idiot love will spark the fusion
Inspirations have I none
Just to touch the flaming dove
All I have is my love of love
And love is not loving
Soul love the priest that tastes the word and
Told of love and how my God on high is
All love though reaching up my loneliness evolves
By the blindness that surrounds himTony went to fight in Belfast
Rudi stayed at home to starve
I could make it all worthwhile
As a rock and roll star
Bevan tried to change the nation
Sonny wants to turn the world well he can tell you that he tried
I could make a transformation as a rock and roll star
So inviting so enticing to play the part
I could play the wild mutation
As a rock and roll star get it on yeah
I could do with the money
Im so wiped out with things as they are
Id send my photograph to my honey and Id cmon like
A regular superstar
I could make a transformation
As a rock and roll star
So inviting so enticing to play the part
I could play the wild mutation
As a rock and roll star get it on yeah
I could do with the money
Im so wiped out with things as they are
Id send my photograph to my honey and Id cmon like
A regular superstar
I could fall asleep at night
As a rock and roll star
I could fall in love all right
As a rock and roll star
Rock and roll star
Rock and roll star

SuffragettePushing through the market square
So many mothers sighing
News had just come over
We had five years left to cry in
News guy wept and told us
Earth was really dying
Cried so much his face was wet
Then I knew he was not lying
I heard telephones opera house favorite melodies
I saw boys toys electric irons and TVs
My brain hurt like a warehouse it had no room to spare
I had to cram so many things to store everything in there
And all the fat-skinny people and all the tall-short people
And all the nobody people and all the somebody people
I never thought Id need so many people
A girl my age went off her head
Hit some tiny children
If the black hadnt a-pulled her off
I think she would have killed them
A soldier with a broken arm
Fixed his stare to the wheels of a Cadillac
A cop knelt and kissed the feet of a priest
And a queer threw up at the sight of that
I think I saw you in an ice-cream parlor
Drinking milk shakes cold and long
Smiling and waving and looking so fine
Dont think you knew you were in this song
And it was cold and it rained so I felt like an actor
And I thought of Ma and I wanted to get back there
Your face your race the way that you talk
I kiss you youre beautiful I want you to walk
Weve got five years stuck on my eyes
Five years what a surprise
Weve got five years my brain hurts a lot

Five yearsZiggy played guitar jamming good with Weird and Gilly
And the spiders from Mars He played it left hand
But made it too far
Became the special man then we were Ziggys band
Now Ziggy really sang screwed up eyes and screwed down hairdo
Like some cat from Japan he could lick em by smiling
He could leave em to hang
Came on so loaded man well hung and snow white tan
So where were the spiders while the fly tried to break our balls
With just the beer light to guide us
So we bitched about his fans and should we crush his sweet hands
Ziggy played for time jiving us that we were voodoo
The kid was just crass he was the nazz
With God given ass
He took it all too far but boy could he play guitar
Making love with his ego Ziggy sucked up into his mind
Like a leper messiah
When the kids had killed the man I had to break up the band
Ziggy played guitarPushing through the market square

Five yearsPeople stared at the makeup on his face
Laughed at his long black hair his animal grace
The boy in the bright blue jeans
Jumped up on the stage
Lady Stardust sang his songs
Of darkness and disgrace
And he was alright the band was altogether
Yes he was alright the song went on forever
Yes he was awful nice
Really quite out of sight
And he sang all night long
Femme fatales emerged from shadows
To watch this creature fair
Boys stood upon their chairs
To make their point of view
I smiled sadly for a love
I could not obey
Lady Stardust sang his songs
Of darkness and dismay
And he was alright the band was altogether
Yes he was alright his song went on forever
And he was awful nice
Really quite paradise
And he sang all night all night long
Oh how I sighed when they asked if I knew his name
Oh that was alright the band was altogether
Yes he was alright and the song went on forever
He was awful nice
Really quite paradise

Theres a starman waiting in the sky
Hes told us not to blow it
Cause he knows its all worthwhile
He told me

Let the children use it
Let all the children boogie

Look out over the sea
Think about the places perhaps where a young man could be
Then you jump back down to the rooftops
Look out over the town
Think about all of the strange things circulating round
It aint easy it aint easy
It aint easy to get to heaven when youre going down
Well all the people have got their problems
That aint nothing new
With the help of the good Lord
We can all pull on through
We can all pull on through
Get there in the end
Sometimes itll take you right up and sometimes down again
It aint easy it aint easy
It aint easy to get to heaven when youre going down
Satisfaction satisfaction
Keep me satisfied
Ive got the love of a hoochie koochie woman
She calling from inside
Shes a-calling from inside

It aint easy it aint easy
It aint easy to get to heaven when youre going down
It aint easy it aint easy

Praying to the light machine
She wants my honey not my money shes a funky-thigh collector
Layin on lectric dreams
Come on come on weve really got a good thing going
Well come on well come on if you think were gonna make it
You better hang on to yourself
We cant dance we dont talk much we just ball and play
But then we move like tigers on Vaseline

You pull on your finger then another finger then your cigarette
The wall to wall is calling it lingers then you forget
Ohhh youre a rock n roll suicide
Youre too old to lose it too young to choose it
And the clock waits so patiently on your song
You walk past a cafe but you dont eat when youve lived too long
Oh no no no youre a rock n roll suicide
Chev brakes are snarling as you stumble across the road
But the day breaks instead so you hurry home
Dont let the sun blast your shadow
Dont let the milk float ride your mind
Youre so natural religiously unkind
Oh no love Youre not alone
Youre watching yourself but youre too unfair
You got your head all tangled up
But if I could only make you care
Oh no love Youre not alone
No matter what or who youve been
No matter when or where youve seen
All the knives seem to lacerate your brain
Ive had my share Ill help you with the pain
Youre not alone
Just turn on with me and youre not alone
Lets turn on with me and youre not alone
Gimme your hands cause youre wonderful
Gimme your hands cause youre wonderful

Till I called on your love
And your love came to me

Till I called on your love
And your love sure did grow

This never happened to Pablo Picasso
He could walk down your street
And get called assholes
So Pablo Picasso was never called an asshole
And girls could not resist his stare and
Well the girls would turn the color
Of the avocado when he would drive
He could walk down your street
Down their street in his El Dorado
And girls could not resist his stare
Pablo Picasso never got called an asshole
Not like you
Alright
Well he was only fifty-three
But girls could not resist his stare
Not in New York
Pablo Picasso never got called an asshole
Oh well be not schmuck be not obnoxious
Remember the story of Pablo Picasso
Be not bellbottom bummer or asshole
He could walk down your street
Pablo Picasso was never called an asshole
Alright this is it
And girls could not resist his stare
Some people try to pick up girlsShe waited by the moon
She was sick with fear and cold
She felt too old for all of this
Of course she never showed
She lugged her suitcase to the bus
Melted home through the snow
North along riverside
She slips beneath the sheets
A husbands quiet devoted wife
But strangers sad and nervous
By the dawns early light
Loves lies like a dead cloud
On a shabby yellow lawn
Up on riverside
Shell drive the big car
Hell sit behind
Shell keep an eye on Jessica
South along the Hudson
Shell turn the radio high
Find a station playing sad sad soul
Just a little bit louder now
South along the Hudson yea
Just a little bit faster now
Just a little bit louder now
Just a little bit angry now
South along the Hudson yea
And shell drive the big car
And talk herself insane
Just a little bit louder now
Just a little bit angry now
Way back when Millennium
Meant racing to the light
He promised her a dream-life
Hed take her back to street-life
Away from violent water
With its Cormorants and leaves
Up on riverside
Shell drive the big car
But hell sit behind
Bursting her bubbles of Ludlow and Grand
South along the Hudson
Shell turn the radio way up high
Find a station playing sad sad soul
Just a little bit louder now
South along the Hudson
Just a little bit faster now
Just a little bit louder now
Just a little bit angry now
South along the Hudson yea
Just a little bit faster now
Just a little bit louder now
Just a little bit angry now
South along the Hudson yea
Shell drive the big car
Hell sit behind
Shell keep an eye on Jessica
Just a little bit faster now
Just a little bit faster nowStreets damp and warm
Empty smell metal
Weeds between buildings
Pictures on my hard drive
But Im the luckiest guy
Not the loneliest guy
Steam under floor
Shards by the mirrors frame
Clouds green and low
No sign no nothing now
But Im the luckiest guy
Not the loneliest guy
All the pages that have turned
All the errors left unlearned oh
Well Im the luckiest guy
Not the loneliest guy
In the world
Not me
Not meSilver leaves are spinning round
Take my hand as we go down and down and down
Looking for water
But I lost God in a New York minute
Dont know about you but my hearts not in it
Looking looking looking
Im looking for water
Im looking for water
Looking looking looking
I cant breathe the air
Cant raise the fight
Cause all weve got left is a beat in the night
And Im
Looking for water
Looking for water
Looking for water
Looking looking
Take my hand as we go down and down
Leave it all behind nothing will be found
Im looking for water
Im looking for water
Looking for water
Looking looking
Im looking for water
Looking everywhere
Looking for water
Looking here and there
Im looking for water
Im looking for water
Looking for water
Looking looking
I cant live in this cage
I cant eat this candy
To the ends of the Earth
To this pain in my head
The look in your eyes
That never means never
The dawns early light
Baby dumb is forever
Looking looking
Looking lookingHold me tight
Keep me cool
Going mad
Dont know what to do
Do I need a friend
Well I need one now
All the days of my life
All the days of my life
All the days I owe you
All Ive done
Ive done for me
All you gave
You gave for free
I gave nothing in return
And theres little left of me
All the days of my life
All the days of my life
All the days I owe you
In red-eyed pain Im knocking on your door again
My crazy brain in tangles
Pleading for your gentle voice
Those storms keep pounding through my head and heart
I pray youll soothe my sorry soul
All the days of my life
All the days of my life
All the days I owe you
All the days of my life
All the days of my life
All the days I owe you
All the days of my life
All the days of my life
All the days I owe youBetter take care
I think I better go I better get a room
Better take care of me
Again and again
I think about this and I think about personal history
Better take care
I breathe so deep when the movie gets real
When the star turns round
Again and again
He looks me in the eye says hes got his mind on a countdown
three two one
Forever
Im screaming that Im gonna be living on till the end of time
Forever
The sky splits open to a dull red skull
And my head hangs low cause its all over now
And theres never gonna be enough money
And theres never gonna be enough drugs
And Im never ever gonna get old
Theres never gonna be enough bullets
Theres never gonna be enough sex
And Im never ever gonna get old
So Im never ever gonna get high
And Im never ever gonna get low
And Im never ever gonna get old
Better take care
The moon flows on to the edges of the world because of you
Again and again
And Im awake in an age of light living it because of you
Better take care
Im looking at the future solid as a rock because of you
Again and again
want to be here and I want to be there
Living just like you living just like me
Forever
Putting on my gloves and bury my bones in the marshland
Forever
Think about my soul but I dont need a thing just the ring of the bell in the pure clean air
And Im running down the street of life
And Im never gonna let you die
And Im never ever gonna get old
And Im never ever gonna get
Im never ever gonna get
Im never ever gonna get old
And Im never ever gonna get
And Im never ever gonna get
Never ever gonna get oldHope little girl
Come blow me away
I dont care much
I win anyway
Just a dog
Im God damn rich
An exploding man
When I talk in the night
Theres oil on my hands
What a dog
Fall dog is cruel and smart
Smart time breaks the heart
Fall dog bombs the moon
Devil in a market place
Devil in your bleeding face
Fall dog bombs the moon
What a dog
Theres always a moron
Someone to hate
A corporate tie
A wig and a date
Just a dog
These blackest of years
That have no sound
No shape no depth
No underground
What a dog
Fall dog is cruel and smart
Smart time breaks the heart
Fall dog bombs the moon
A devil in a market place
A devil in your bleeding face
Fall dog bombs the moon
What a dogTragic youth was looking young and sexy
The tragic youth was wearing tattered black jeans
Bearing arms and flaunting all her mischief
The tragic youth was going down on me
And I swear
Woo hoo
Yes I swear
I built a wall of sound to separate us
And hid among the junk of wretched highs
I sped from Planet X to Planet Alpha
Struggling for reality
Ha ha ha ha
Woo hoo
Ha ha ha ha
Whoo hoo
Hey now my sight is failing in this twilight
Da da da da da da da da da
Now my death is more than just a sad song
Da da da da da da da da da
And I swear
Woo hoo
Yes I swear
Woo hoo
I still dont remember how this happened
I still dont get the wherefores and the whys
I look for sense but I get next to nothing
Hey boy welcome to reality
Ha ha ha ha
Woo hoo
Ive been right and Ive been wrong
Now Im back where I started from
Never looked over realitys shoulder
Ha ha ha ha
Huh ha ha ha
Woo hoo
Huh ha ha
Wooh
Woo hoo
WoohYou promised me the ending would be clear
Youd let me know when the time was now
Dont let me know when youre opening the door
Stab me in the dark let me disappear
Memories that flutter like bats out of hell
Stab you from the city spires
Life wasnt worth the balance
Or the crumpled paper it was written on
Dont let me know were invisible
Dont let me know were invisible
Hot cash days that you trailed around
Cold cold nights under chrome and glass
Led me down river of perfumed limbs
Sent me to the streets with the good time girls
Dont let me know were invisible
Dont let me know were invisible
We could dance dance dance through the fire
Dance dance dance through the fire
Feed me no lies
I dont know about you I dont know about you
Breathe through the years
I dont know about you I dont know about you
Bring me the disco king
I dont know about you I dont know about you
Dead or alive bring me the disco king
Bring me the disco king bring me the disco king
Bring me the disco king
Spin-offs with those who slept like corpses
Damp morning rays in the stiff bad clubs
Killing time in the seventys
Smelling of love through the moist winds
Dont let me know when youre opening the door
Close me in the dark let me disappear
Soon therell be nothing left of me
Nothing left to release
Dance dance dance through the fire
Dance dance dance through the fire
Feed me no lies
I dont know about you I dont know about you
Breathe through the years
I dont know about you I dont know about you
Bring me the disco king
I dont know about you I dont know about you
Dead or alive bring me the disco king
Bring me the disco king
Bring me the disco king bring me the disco king
Bring me the disco king bring me the disco king
Bring me the disco king bring me the disco kingSee the great white scar
Over Battery Park
Then a flare glides over
But I wont look at that scar
Oh my nuclear baby
Oh my idiot trance
All my idiot questions
Lets face the music and dance
Dont ever say Im ready Im ready Im ready
I never said Im better Im better Im better
Dont ever say Im ready Im ready Im ready
I never said Im better Im better Im better Im better than you
All the corners of the buildings
Who but we remember these
The sidewalks and trees
Im thinking now
I got a better way
I discovered a star
I got a better way
Ready set go
I got a better way
A new killer star
I got a better way
Ready set go
I got a better way
The stars in your eyes
I got a better way
Ready set go
I got a better way
I discovered a star
I got a better way
Ready set go
See my life in a comic
Like the way they did the Bible
With the bubbles and action
The little details in color
First a horseback bomber
Just a small thin chance
Like seeing Jesus on Dateline
Lets face the music and dance

I know something is very wrong
The post returns for prodigal songs
With black-eyed sharks with flowered muse
With skull designs upon my shoes
I cant give everything
I cant give everything
Away

Seeing more and feeling less
Saying no but meaning yes

Thats the message that I sent
I cant give everything

I cant give everything
Away

I wanna feel itThe children of the summers end
Gathered in the dampened grass
We played Our songs and felt the London sky
Resting on our hands
It was Gods land
It was ragged and naive
It was Heaven
Touch we touched the very soul
Of holding each and every life
We claimed the very source of joy ran through
It didnt but it seemed that way
I kissed a lot of people that day
Oh to capture just one drop of all the ecstasy that swept that afternoon
To paint that love upon a white balloon
And fly it from the toppest top of all the tops that man has pushed beyond his
Brain
Satoria must be something just the same
We scanned the skies with rainbow eyes and saw machines of every shape and size
We talked with tall Venusians passing through
And Peter tried to climb aboard but the Captain shook his head
And away they soared
Climbing through the ivory vibrant cloud
Someone passed some bliss among the crowd
And we walked back to the road unchainedWell its one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-nine OK
All across the USA
Its another year for me and you
Another year with nothing to do
Last year I was twenty-one
I didnt have a lot of fun
And now Im gonna be twenty-two

Its one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-nine OK all across the USA
Its another year for me and you
Another year with nothing to do
Another year with nothing to do
Its one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-nine

Throwing darts in lovers eyes
Here are we one magical moment such is the stuff
From where dreams are woven
Bending sound dredging the ocean lost in my circle
Here am I flashing no color
Tall in this room overlooking the ocean
Here are we one magical movement from Kether to Malkuth
There are you you drive like a demon from station to station
The return of the Thin White Duke throwing darts in lovers eyes
The return of the Thin White Duke throwing darts in lovers eyes
The return of the Thin White Duke making sure white stays
Once there were mountains on mountains
And once there were sun birds to soar with
And once I could never be down
Got to keep searching and searching
Oh what will I be believing and who will connect me with love
Wonderful wonderful wonder when
Have you sought fortune evasive and shy
Drink to the men who protect you and I
Drink drink drain your glass raise your glass high
Its not the side-effects of the cocaine
Im thinking that it must be love
Its too late to be grateful
Its too late to be late again
Its too late to be hateful
The European cannon is here
I must be only one in a million
I wont let the day pass without her
Its too late to be grateful
Its too late to be late again
Its too late to be hateful
The European cannon is here
Should I believe that Ive been stricken
Does my face show some kind of glow
Its too late to be grateful
Its too late to be late again
Its too late to be hateful
The European cannon is here yes its here
Its too late
Its too late its too late its too late its too late
The European cannon is here
Its not the side-effects of the cocaine
Im thinking that it must be love
Its too late to be grateful
Its too late to be late again
Its too late to be hateful
The European cannon is here
I must be only one in a million
I wont let the day pass without her
Its too late to be grateful
Its too late to be late again
Its too late to be hateful
The European cannon is here
Should I believe that Ive been stricken
Does my face show some kind of glow
Its too late to be grateful
Its too late to be late again
Its too late to be hateful
The European cannon is here yes its here
Its too late
Its too late its too late its too late its too late
The European cannon is hereIn this age of grand illusion
You walked into my life
Out of my dreams
I dont need another change
Still you forced your way
Into my scheme of things
You say were growing
Growing heart and soul
In this age of grand illusion
You walked into my life
Out of my dreams
Sweet name youre born once again for me
Sweet name youre born once again for me
Oh sweet name I call you again
Youre born once again for me
Just because I believe dont mean I dont think as well
Dont have to question everything
In heaven or hell
Lord I kneel and offer you
My word on a wing
And Im trying hard to fit among
Your scheme of things
Its safer than a strange land
But I still care for myself
And I dont stand in my own light
Lord Lord MY prayer flies
Like a word on a wing
My prayer flies
Like a word on a wing
Does my prayer fit in
With your scheme of things
In this age of grand illusion
You walked into my life
Out of my dreams
Sweet name youre born once again for me
Just as long as I can see Ill never stop this vision flowing
I look twice and youre still flowing
Just as long as I can walk
Ill walk beside you Im alive in you
Sweet name youre born once again for me
And Im ready to shape the scheme of things
Ooh ready to shape
The scheme of things
Ooh ready to shape
The scheme of things
Ooh ready to shape
The scheme of things
Ooh ready to shape
The scheme of things
Lord I kneel and offer you
My word on a wing
And Im trying hard to fit among
Your scheme of things
Its safer than a strange land
But I still care for myself
And I dont stand in my own light
Oh Lord Lord Lord my prayer flies
Like a word on a wing
And Im trying hard to fit among
Your scheme of things
Its safer than a strange land
But I still care for myself
And I dont stand in my own light
Lord Lord my prayer flies
Like a word on a wing
My prayer flies like a word on a wing
Does my prayer fit in
With your scheme of thingsThis week dragged past me so slowly
The days fell on their knees
Maybe Ill take something to help me
Hope someone takes after me
I guess theres always some change in the weather
This time I know we could get it together
If I did casually mention tonight
That would be crazy tonight
Stay thats what I meant to say or do something
But I never say is stay this time
I really meant to so badly this time
Cause you can never really tell when somebody
Wants something you want too
Heartwrecker heartwrecker make me delight
Life is so vague when it brings someone new
This time tomorrow Ill know what to do
I know its happened to you
Stay thats what I meant to say or do something
But what I never say is stay this time
I really meant to so badly this time
Cause you can never really tell when somebody
Wants so much to stay
Thats what I meant to say or do something
But what I never say is stay this time
I really meant to so badly this time
Cause you can never really tell when somebody
Wants something you want tooLove me love me love me love me
Say you do
Let me fly away
With you
For my love is like
The wind

Wild is the wind

Blow through your heart

So sick and dirty more dead than alive

And you you will be queen
Though nothing will drive them away
We can beat them just for one day
We can be heroes just for one day
And you you can be mean
And I Ill drink all the time
Cause were lovers and that is a fact
Yes were lovers and that is that
Though nothing will keep us together
We could steal time just for one day
We can be heroes forever and ever
What dyou say
do Konntest do schwimmen
Wie Delphine Delphine es tun
Niemand gibt uns eine Chance
Doch wir konnen siegen
Fur immer und immer
Und wir sind dann Helden
Fur einen tag
Ich Ich bin dann KÃnig
Und do do KÃnigin
Obwohl sie
Unschlagbar scheinen
Werden wir Helden
Fur einen Tag
Wir sind dann wir
An diesem Tag
Ich Ich glaubte zu trÃumen
Die Mauer Im RÃ¼cken war kalt
Schusse reissen die Luft
Doch wir kussen
Als ob nichts geschieht
Und die Scham fiel auf ihre seite
Oh wir konnen sie schlagen
Fur alle zeiten
Dann sind wir Helden

Were nothing
And nothing will help us
Maybe were lying
Then you better not stay
But we could be safer
Just for one day
Oh oh oh ohGround Control to Major Tom
Ground Control to Major Tom
Take your protein pills and put your helmet on
Ground Control to Major Tom ten nine eight seven six
Commencing countdown engines on five four three
Check ignition and may Gods love be with you two one liftoff
This is Ground Control to Major Tom
Youve really made the grade
And the papers want to know whose shirts you wear
Now its time to leave the capsule if you dare
This is Major Tom to Ground Control
Im stepping through the door
And Im floating in a most peculiar way
And the stars look very different today
For here
Am I sitting in a tin can
Far above the world
Planet Earth is blue
And theres nothing I can do
Though Im past one hundred thousand miles
Im feeling very still
And I think my spaceship knows which way to go
Tell my wife I love her very much she knows
Ground Control to Major Tom
Your circuits dead theres something wrong
Can you hear me Major Tom
Can you hear me Major Tom
Can you hear me Major Tom
Can you Here am I floating round my tin can
Far above the moon
Planet Earth is blue
And theres nothing I can doInstrumentalWell the joint was rocking
Going round n round
Yeah reeling and a-rocking
What a crazy sound
Well they never stopped rocking
Til the moon went down
Well it sounded so sweet
I had to take me a chance
I rose out of my seat
And had to dance
I started moving my feet
And clapping my hands
Yeah we kept on rocking
Going round n round
Yeah reeling and a-rocking
What a crazy sound
Well they never stopped rocking
Til the moon went down
About twelve oclock
When the place was packed
The front doors were locked
I said the place was packed
When the police knocked
Those doors flew back
But kept on rocking
Going round n round
Yeah reeling and a-rocking
What a crazy sound
Well they never stopped rocking
Til the moon went down
Yeah
About twelve oclock
Around lock up time
Well the doors were locked
Said the place was packed
When the police knocked
Those doors flew back
But it kept on rocking
Going round n round
Yeah reeling and a-rocking
What a crazy sound
Well they never stopped rocking
Til the moon went down
Yeah it kept on rocking
Going round n round
Yeah reeling and a-rocking
What a crazy sound
Well they never stopped rocking
Til the moon went downSolemn faced
The village settles down
Undetected by the stars
And the hangman plays the mandolin before he goes to sleep
And the last thing on his mind
Is the Wild Eyed Boy imprisoned
Neath the covered wooden shaft
Folds the rope
Into its bag
Blows his pipe of smolders
Blankets smoke into the room
And the day will end for some
As the night begins for one
Staring through the message in his eyes
Lies a solitary son
From the mountain called Freecloud
Where the eagle dare not fly
And the patience in his sigh
Gives no indication
For the townsmen to decide
So the village Dreadful yawns
Pronouncing gross diversion
As the label for the dog
Oh Its the madness in his eyes
As he breaks the night to cry
Its really Me
Really You
And really Me
Its so hard for us to really be
Really You
And really Me
Youll lose me though Im always
Really free
And the mountain moved its eyes
To the world of realize
Where the snow had saved a place
For the Wild Eyed Boy
From Freecloud
And the village dreadful cried
As the rope began to rise
For the smile stayed on the face
Of the Wild Eyed Boy
From Freecloud
And the women once proud
Clutched the heart of the crowd
As the boulders smashed down from the mountains hand
And the magic in the stare
Of the Wild Eyed Boy said
Stop Freecloud
They wont think to cut me down
But the cottages fell
Like a playing card hell
And the tears on the face
Of the Wise Boy
Came tumbling down
To the rumbling ground
And the missionary mystic of peacelove
Stumbled to cry among the clouds
Kicking back the pebbles
From the freecloud mountain trackInstrumentalINSTRUMENTALYou remind me of the babe

Youve run so long

Your eyes can be so cruel
Just as I can be so cruel
Though I do believe in you
Yes I do
Live without the sunlight
Love without your heartbeat
I I cant live within you
I cant live within you
I I cant live within youAlways in trouble
Never to blame
Must be a double
You are the same

Doing the wrong thing
Forgetting your lines
Waiting for something better to shine
Take that same okay

Ah yeah look ah
I was gettin in to thatOutside the storm clouds gathering
move silently along the dusty boulevard
where flowers turning crane
their fragile mane
so they can in turn reach up and kiss the sky
Theyre driven by a strange desire
unseen by the human eye
someones calling
I remember when you held my hand
in the park we would wait
when the circus came to town over here
Outside the circus gathering
moves silently along the rain swept bouledvard
the procession moves on the shouting is over
the fabulous freaks are leaving town
Theyre driven by a strange desire
unseen by the human eye
someones calling
The carnival is over
We sat and watched
as the moon rose
for the very first timeI had skin like leather and the diamond-hard look of a cobra
I was born blue and weathered but I burst just like a supernova
I could walk like Brando right into the sun
Then dance just like a Casanova
With my blackjack and jacket and hair slicked sweet
Silver star studs on my duds like a Harley in heat
When I strut down the street I could hear its heartbeat
The sisters fell back and said Dont that man look pretty
The cripple on the corner cried out Nickels for your pity
Them gasoline boys downtown sure talk gritty
Its so hard to be a saint in the city
I was the king of the alley mama I could talk some trash
I was the prince of the paupers crowned downtown at the beggars bash
I was the pimps main prophet I kept everything cool
Just a backstreet gambler with the luck to lose
And when the heat came down it was left on the ground
The devil appeared like Jesus through the steam in the street
Showin me a hand I knew even the cops couldnt beat
I felt his hot breath on my neck as I dove into the heat
Its so hard to be a saint when youre just a boy out on the street
And the sages of the subway sit just like the living dead
As the tracks clack out the rhythm their eyes fixed straight ahead
They ride the line of balance and hold on by just a thread
But its too hot in these tunnels you can get hit up by the heat
You get up to get out at your next stop but they push you back down in your seat
Your heart starts beatin faster as you struggle to your feet
Then youre outta that hole and back up on the street
And them South Side sisters sure look pretty
The cripple on the corner cries out Nickels for your pity
And them downtown boys sure talk gritty
Its so hard to be a saint in the citySomeday they wont let you but now you must agree
The times they are a-telling and the changing isnt free
Youve read it in the tea leaves the tracks are on TV
Beware the savage jaw
Of one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four
Theyll break your pretty cranium and fill it full of air
And tell you that youre eighty but lover you wont care
Youll be shooting up as usual like tomorrow wasnt there
Beware the savage jaw
Of one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four
Come see come see remember me
We played at an all night movie role
You said it would last but I guess we rolled
In one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four who could ask for more
one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four who could ask for more
Now we can talk in confidence
Did you guess that weve been done wrong
Lies jump in queue to be first in line
Such a shameless design
He thinks hes well screened from the man at the top
Its a shame that his children disagree
They coolly decide to sell him down the line
Daddys brainwashing time
Hes a dodo no no didnt hear it from me didnt hear it from me
Hes a dodo no no didnt hear it from me didnt hear it from me
Shes doesnt recall her blessed childhood of yore
When a unit was a figure not a she
When lovers chose each other seems the perks are due
Another memo to screw
Shes a dodo no no didnt hear it from me didnt hear it from me
Shes a dodo no no didnt hear it from me didnt hear it from me
Can you wipe your nose my child
Without them slotting in your file a photograph
Will you sleep in fear tonight
Wake to find the scorching light of neighbour Jim
Hes come to turn you in
Another dodo no no didnt hear it from me didnt hear it from me
Another dodo no no didnt hear it from me didnt hear it from me
Another dodo no no didnt hear it from me didnt hear it from me
Come see come see remember me
We played at an all night movie role
You said it would last but I guess we enrolled
In one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four who could ask for more
one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four who could ask for mor-or-or-or-ore
Mor-or-or-or-ore
one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four
one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four who could ask for more
one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four
one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four who could ask for more
one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four
one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four who could ask for more
one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four
OooooInstrumentalTheres such a sad look
In your eyes a kind of pale jewel
Open and closed within your eyes
I see the sky in your eyes
Theres such a fooled heart
Beating so fast in search of new dreams
A love that will last within your heart
Ill place the moon within your heart
As the pain sweeps through
Makes no sense for you
Every thrill has gone
Wasnt too much fun at all
But Ill be there for you
As the world falls down
Falling
As the world Falling down
Falling in love
Ill paint you mornings of gold
Ill spin you Valentine evenings
Though were strangers till now
Were choosing the path between the stars
Ill leave my love between the stars
As the pain sweeps through
Makes no sense for you
Every thrill has gone
Wasnt too much fun at all
But Ill be there for you
As the world falls down
Falling
As the world Falling down

Red light green light

Ooh ah Kitty just you see
Dont put the blame on me oh no

To wrangle some screams from the dawn
And isnt it me putting pain in a stranger
Like a portrait in flesh who trails on a leash
Will you see that Im scared and Im lonely
So Ill break up my room and yawn and I
Run to the center of things
Where the knowing one says
Boys Boys its a sweet thing
Boys Boys its a sweet thing sweet thing
If you want it Boys get it here thing
Cause hope Boys is a cheap thing cheap thing
Im glad that youre older than me
Makes me feel important and free
Does that make you smile isnt that me
Im in your way and Ill steal every moment
If this trade is a curse then Ill bless you
And turn to the crossroads of Hamburg as in
Boys Boys its a sweet thing
Boys Boys its a sweet thing sweet thing
If you want it Boys get it here thing
Cause hope Boys is a cheap thing cheap thing
Part Two Candidate
Ill make you a deal like any other candidate
Well pretend were walking home cause your futures at stake
My set is amazing it even smells like a street
Theres a bar at the end where I can meet you and your friend
Someone scrawled on the wall I smell the blood of Les Tricoteuses
Who wrote up scandals in other bars
Im having so much fun with the poisonous people
Spreading rumors and lies and stories they made up
Some make you sing and some make you scream
One makes you wish that youd never been seen
But theres a shop on the corner thats selling papier mache
Making bullet-proof faces Charlie Manson Cassius Clay
If you want it Boys get it here thing
So you scream out of line
I want you I need you Anyone out there Any time
Tres butch little number whines Hey dirty I want you
When its good its really good and when its bad I go to pieces
If you want it Boys get it here thing
Well on the street where you live I could not hold up my head
For I put all I have in another bed
On another floor in the back of a car
In the cellar of a church with the door ajar
Well I guess we must be looking for a different kind
But we cant stop trying til we break up our minds
Til the sun drips blood on the seedy young knights
Who press you on the ground while shaking in fright
I guess we could cruise down one more time
With you by my side it should be fine
Well buy some drugs and watch a band
Then jump in the river holding hands
Part Three Sweet Thing Reprise
If you want it boys get it here thing
Cause hope boys is a cheap thing cheap thing
Is it nice in your snow storm freezing your brain
Do you think that your face looks the same
Then let it be its all I ever wanted
Its a street with a deal and a taste
Its got claws its got me its got you Your coat and hat are gone
I really cant look at your little empty shelf
A ragged teddy bear
It feels like we never had a chance
Dont look me in the eye
We lay in each others arms
But the room is just an empty space
I guess we lived it out
Something in the air
We smile too fast
Then cant think of a thing to say
Lived with the best times
Left with the worst
Danced with you too long
Nothing left to save
Lets take what we can
I know youll hold your head up high
Weve raged for the last time
A place of no return
And theres something in the air
Something in my eye
Ive danced with you too long
Yeah
Something in the air
Something in my eye
Abracadoo I lose you
We cant avoid the clash the big mistake
Now were going to pay and pay
The sentence of our lives
Cant believe Im asking you to go
We used what we could
To get the things we want
But we lost each other on the way
I guess you know I never wanted anyone more than you
Lived all our best times
Left with the worst
Ive danced with you too long
Say what you will
Theres something in the air
Raged for the last time
But I know youll hold your head up high
Theres nothing we have to say
Theres nothing in our eyes
But theres something in the air
Something in my eye
I danced with you too long
Theres something I have to say
Theres something in the air
Something in my eye
Ive danced with you too long
Danced with you too long
Danced with you too long
And theres something in the air
Something in the airI was Ramona A Stone
I started with no enemies of my own
I was an artiste
In a tunnel
But Ive been having a mid-life crisis
And Ive been dreaming of sleep
And ape men made with metal parts
Ive spat upon deeply felt age
Ive hid my hearts in
And I hate the funny colored English
Well creep together you and I
For I know who the small friends are
I am with name I am with name
I am Ramona A Stone
A night fear female good timing drone
I am with name I am with name
I am with name I am with name
I am Ramona A Stone
She should say
Twitch and stream itll end in chrome
The night of the female
Good time drone
I am with name
I am Ramona A Stone
She should say
I am with name
I am Ramona A Stone
A person who loses a name
Feels anxiety descending
Left at the crossroads between the centuries
A millennium fetish
I am with name I am with name
I am Ramona A Stone
I am with name
Night fear female good timing drone
I am with name
I am Ramona A Stone
Give it to me one more time
Anxiety descending
Anxiety descendingThough the idea of confession it is said to be
The union of and his bride the Christian
Its all very puzzling
Sex and the church sex and the church
Sex and the church and the church and the church
All the great mystic religions put strong emphasis
On the redeeming spiritual qualities of sex of sex
Christianity has been pretty modern about sex
Of sex of sex of sex of sex
Sex and the church sex and the church
Sex and the church sex sex
I think there is a union between the flesh and the spirit
Sex and the church sex and the church
All religions mother
Give me the freedom of spirit and the joys
Of the flesh and sex sex sex and the church

Bleeds like a craze Dad
These are the craze
Easy come come gotta back
In the valley of the dead man walks
How they drank from the jazz
Astral Kestrel
Fed into the featherfall
Fed him on a pencil carving
You will never get
Shine shine shine
Bleed like a craze Dad
These are the craze
Shine shine shine
Bleed like a craze Dad
These are the craze
Seek for a leather journey
Never stopped to think about

Street light looking right
Looking to the parlous parlors
Party on the dead
Put a net through his headache

Sailors in snow

Watch me while you can
Been trawling too long Ive been losing out strong
For the strength of another man
Ive been hasty wasty standing on the backstep
Waiting for the phone to ring
But this semi-acoustic love affair
Is driving me to the brink
Im just looking for a friend
Im just looking for a friend
You dont have to be a big wheel you dont have to be the end
Im just looking for looking for a friend
God help all you ladies
May the devil take all you men
Youre far too busy having babies
To help yourselves to a friend
Youre lazy crazy hung upon the insane
Waiting for the phone to ring
Incomprehensible
Incomprehensible the wall
Im just looking for a friend
Im just looking for a friend
You dont have to be a big wheel you dont have to be the end
Im just looking for looking for a friend looking
Im just looking for a friend

You dont have to be a big wheel you dont have to be the end
Im just looking for looking for a friend
Im just looking for a friend
Im just looking for a friend
You dont have to be a big wheel you dont have to be the end
Im just looking for looking for a friendThe children of the summers end
Gathered in the dampened grass
We played Our songs and felt the London sky
Resting on our hands
It was Gods land
It was ragged and naive
It was Heaven
Touch we touched the very soul
Of holding each and every life
We claimed the very source of joy ran through
It didnt but it seemed that way
I kissed a lot of people that day
Oh to capture just one drop of all the ecstasy that swept that afternoon
To paint that love upon a white balloon
And fly it from the toppest top of all the tops that man has pushed beyond his
Brain
Satoria must be something just the same
We scanned the skies with rainbow eyes and saw machines of every shape and size
We talked with tall Venusians passing through
And Peter tried to climb aboard but the Captain shook his head
And away they soared
Climbing through the ivory vibrant cloud
Someone passed some bliss among the crowd

DuhTook a trip on a Gemini spacecraft
And I thought about you
I passed through the shadow of Jupiter
And I thought about you
I shot my space gun
And boy I really felt blue
Two or three flying saucers
Parked under the stars winding stream
Moon shining down on some little town
And with each beam the same old dream
I took a trip on a Gemini spacecraft
And I thought about you
Well I shot my spacegun
And I thought about you
Pulled down my sun visor
Boy I really felt blue
You jumped into your Gemini I jumped into mine
Well orbit the Moon for just one time
Tomorrow night tomorrow night
Will you hold hands with me under the moonlight
Took a trip in a Gemini spacecraft
And I thought about you
I shot my space gun
And I thought about you
And I took a I took a walk in space
Boy I really felt blue
Well I peeked through the crack and looked way back
Stardust trail leading back to you

Well

Did you guess that weve been done wrong
Lies jumped the queue to be first in line
Such a shameless design
He thinks hes well screened from the man at the top
Its a shame that his children disagree
They coolly decide to sell him down the line
Daddys brainwashing time
Hes a dodo no no didnt hear it from me
Hes a dodo no no didnt hear it from me
Shes quite enthralled with the childhood of yore
When a unit was a figure not a she
When lovers chose each other now the perks are due
Another memo to screw
Shes a dodo no no didnt hear it from me
Shes a dodo no no didnt hear it from me
Can you wipe your nose my child
Without them slotting in your file a photograph
Can you sleep alone at night
Wake to find the scorching light of neighbor Jim
Hes come to turn you in
Another dodo no no didnt hear it from me
Another dodo no no didnt hear it from me
Another dodo didnt hear it from meStinky weather fat shaky hands

Who believes at where he is
And theres a girl
Up ahead who says she knows
And the street overflows
With the folk who understand
But for the guy who cant be seen
Hes the Shadow Man
And the Shadow Man is close at hand
Take a turn and see his smile
Made of nothing but loneliness
Just take a walk and be a friend
To the Shadow Man
You can call him Joe you can call him Sam
You should call and see who answers
For he promises to come running guided by the truth
But the Shadow Man is really you
Look in his eyes and see your reflection
Look to the stars and see his eyes
Hell show you tomorrow hell show you the sorrows
Of what you did today
You can call him foe you can call him friend
You should call and see who answers
For he knows your eyes are drawn to the road ahead
And the Shadow Man is waiting round the bend
Oh the Shadow Man
Ohooooo oooo
Shadow man shadow man
Its really you its really you its really you
Hes the shadow man
Oh yeah
Shadow manHallo Spaceboy youre sleepy now second time Hallo

Because the years of fretting days are right behind you now
Dont return to fields of green where rainbow secrets were told
Place your ragged doll with all the toys and things and deeds
I will show you a game where the winner never wins
Let your hair hang down wear the dress your mother wore
Let me sleep beside you
Lock away your childhood and throw away the key
For now the streets and city sounds will burn your eyes as coals
We shall drink the oldest wine and velvet skies will linger
Child youre a woman now your heart and soul are free
I will boldly light that lamp and we shall walk together
Let your hair hang down wear the dress your mother wore
Let me sleep beside you
Your darkened eyes throw mystery
But your lips are void of history
You could not imagine that it could happen this way could you
I will give you dreams and Ill tell you things youll like to hear
Let your hair hang down wear the dress your mother wore
Let me sleep beside you

Wheres the morning in my life

I would not challenge a giant
I could not take on the church
Time will crawl
Til the twenty-onest century lose
I know a government man
He was as blind as the moon
He saw the sun in the night
He took a top-gun pilot
He made him fly through a hole
Til he grew real old
And he never came down
He just flew til he burst
Time will crawl til our mouths run dry
Time will crawl til our feet grow small
Time will crawl til our tails fall off
Time will crawl til the twenty-onest century lose
I saw a black black stream
Full of white eyed fish
And a drowning man
With no eyes at all
I felt a warm warm breeze
That melted metal and steel
I got a bad migraine
That lasted three long years
And the pills that I took
Made my fingers disappear
Time will crawl time will crawl
Time will crawl
Til the twenty-onest century lose
You were a talented child
You came to live in our town
We never bothered to scream
When your mask came off
We only smelt the gas
As we lay down to sleep
Time will crawl and our heads bowed down
Time will crawl and our eyes fall out
Time will crawl and the streets run red
Time will crawl til the twenty-onest century lose
Time will crawl and our mouths run dry
Time will crawl and our feet grow small
Time will crawl and our tails fall off
Time will crawl til the twenty-onest century lose
Time will crawl and our heads bowed down
Time will crawl and our eyes fall out
Time will crawl and the streets run red
Time will crawl til the twenty-onest century lose
For the crazy child
Well give every life
For the crackpot notionSaid youd took a big trip
They said you moved away
Happened oh so quietly they say
Shouldve took a picture
Something I could keep
Buy a little frame something cheap
For you
Everyone says hi
Said you sailed a big ship
Said you sailed away

Id love to get a letter
Like to know whats what
Hope the weathers good and its not too hot

Hold your mad hands I cried
Tis a pity she was a whore
Tis my curse I suppose
That was patrol
That was patrol
This is the war
Black struck the kiss she kept my cock
Smote the mistress drifting on
Tis a pity she was a whore
She stole my purse with rattling speed
That was patrol
This is the war
Tis a pity she was a whore
Man she punched me like a dude
Hold your mad hands I cried
Tis a pity she was a whore
Tis my fate I suppose
For that was patrol
That was patrol
Tis a pity she was a whore
Tis a pity she was a whoreLiving in lies by the railway line
Pushing the hair from my eyes
Elvis is English and climbs the hills
Cant tell the bullshit from the lies
Screaming along in South London
Vicious but ready to learn
Sometimes I fear that the whole world is queer
Sometimes but always in vain
So Ill wait until were sane
Wait until were blessed and all the same
Full of blood loving life and all its got to give
Englishmen going insane
Down on my knees in Suburbia
Down on myself in every way
With great expectations I change all my clothes
Mustnt grumble at silver and gold
Screaming above Central London
Never bored so Ill never get old
So Ill wait until were sane
Wait until were blessed and all the same
Full of blood loving life and all its got to give
Englishmen going insane
Down on my knees in suburbia
Down on myself in every way
Day after day after day day after
Zane Zane Zane Ouvre le chien
Day after day day after
Zane Zane Zane Ouvre le chien
Day afterHere shall we live in this terrible town
Where the price for our minds
shall squeeze them tight like a fist
And the walls shall have eyes
And the doors shall have ears
But well dance in their dark
And theyll play with our lives
Like a Slow Burn
Leading us on and on and on
Like a Slow Burn
Turning us round and round and round Hark who are we
So small in times such as these
Slow Burn
Slow Burn
Oh these are the days
These are the strangest of all
These are the nights
These are the darkest to fall
But who knows
Echoes in tenement halls
Who knows
Though the years spare them all
Like a Slow Burn
Leading us on and on and on
Like a Slow Burn
Twirling us round and round
and upside down
Theres fear overhead
Theres fear overground
Slow Burn
Slow Burn
Like a Slow Burn
Leading us on and on and on
Like a Slow Burn
Turning us round and round and
Round And here are we
At the center of it all
Slow Burn
Slow Burn
Slow BurnI forgot what my father said
I forgot what he said
I forgot what my mother said
As we lay upon your bed
A city full of flowers
A city full of rain
I got seven days to live my life
Or seven ways to die
I forgot what my brother said
I forgot what he said
I dont regret anything at all
I remember how we wept
On a bridge of violent people
I was small enough to cry
I got seven days to live my life
Or seven ways to die
Hold my face before you
Still my trembling heart
Seven days to live my life
Or seven ways to die
The gods forgot they made me
So I forget them too
I listen to the shadows
I play among their graves
My heart was never broken
My patience never tried
I got seven days to live my life
Or seven ways to die
Seven days to live my life
Or seven ways to die
SevenWhen I believed in nothing I called her name
Trapped in a high-dollar joint in some place I called her name
And though my days are slipping by
And nights so cruel I thought Id die
She danced her little dance till it made me cry
She was shakin like this honey doing that
When I needed soul revival I called your name
When I was falling to pieces I screamed in pain
Your soothing hand that turned me round
A love so real swept over me
You danced your little dance till it made me cry
You were shakin like this honey doing that
Never let me down
She never let me down
Never let me down
She never let me down
When all your faith is failing
Call my name
When youve nothing coming
Call my name
Ill be strong for all it takes
Ill cover your head till the bad stuff breaks
Ill dance my little dance till it makes you smile
Shaking like this honey doing that
Never let you down
Ill never let you down
Ill never let you down
Ill never let you downWow this aint the right thing to do so lets go
Young girls they know what theyre after
Young girls dont kiss me goodbye
Rockets shooting up into space
Buildings they rise to the skies
Bang Bang I got mine
Bang Bang reach for the sky
I keep a good friend on videotape
Hell drive his sports car until its too late
But well have a hot time on the town tonight
Cause love is my bet and its the best yet
Bang Bang I got mine
Bang Bang sun dont shine
Bang Bang you all angels
Bang Bang now you all ought to be in pictures
Oh girl

Bang Bang and you are next in line
Bang Bang reach for the sky
Bang Bang sun dont shine
Rise buildings

A lovers secrets in the UK
Torn apart in the UK
In the dribble of May-Day
eighty-seven and Cry
eighty-seven and Cry
And theres nothing inside
And theres nothing in mind
And only you
Rocket on through the sky
It couldnt be done without dogs
It couldnt be once without us
eighty-seven and Cry
eighty-seven and Cry
When the days were the days were the days boys
When blue ties were for the biggy guys
Frannie dressing down for the enemy
You saw him hangin on the enemy
And theres no one in love
And theres nowhere to scream
And only you
Race on to wonder where
It couldnt be done without dogs
It couldnt be once without us
eighty-seven and Cry
eighty-seven and Cry
You cant make love with money
You cant make mistakes with babies
Nothing looked good on you
Thats how I liked you best
Now youre ready for the real McCoy
Deep in the heart of Cupid
Murders on the heels of love
Just the ghost of a story
Just a one dollar secret
Baby these were the sounds
Baby these were the sounds
And only you
Whisper these things arent true
It couldnt be done with dogs
It couldnt be once without us
eighty-seven and Cry
eighty-seven and CryEddie boy lit like paraffin
Spending two weeks
In a crack house
Burns on his brain
Like Chernobyl
Dean was seen
With a two bag purchase
He was lying dead on his mothers bed
Someone for pray for-
Till I met you
Life is like a broken arrow-
Memory a swingin door
I could be your great misfortune-
I can make you happy
Every day of your life
Making my love
Like a shining star
Takin my love just a touch too far
Tessie turns tricks with a soul like ice
Cause love left holes
And four swell kids breaking her heart
Ive got windows Ive seen much vice
Ive touched down with vermin
Cowardice lice
And I say
Nobody cares what you do-
Please be yourself to death
I could be your great misfortune
But youll never find a bet youll never find a better man
Making my love
Like a shining star
Taking my love just a touch too far
Peter met Frank
Formed a dummy run gang
Worked heist or hit for ten gs flat
Blew heads outta shape for the name of Trotsky Sinn-
Fein Hitler cashdown
No hope heroes cover the page
With debts in hell
And fingers in blood
Poor little bodies all covered in scabs
Threw it all away
Another life in the grave
Another life in the grave
Life is like a broken arrow-
Memory a swingin door
I could be your great misfortune-
Well I could make you happy
Every goddamn single day of your life
Making my love
Like a shining star
Like a shining star
Baby thats what you are
Like a shining star
Making my love
Like a shining star
Taking my love
Just a touch too farDo you see that thing
Im sure its love
Would you do one thing
New Yorks in love
The city grew wings in the back of the night
The clouds are stuck like candy-floss
She sees the rich trash having all the fun
Makes her wonder where they get the energy from
Theres nothing you can do to her
This citys all clean and waiting
I dont mean to wait too long
But this joint cant get much higher
CHORUS
New Yorks in love-
With her big green eyes
And her long blonde hair
New Yorks in flames
New Yorks in love
With the way she talks
And the way she walks
New Yorks in love
Goo Goo Goo Goo Goo Goo
My oh my its a tom-tom beat
No-one knows theyve had their day
We can dance and we can see the singles swing
Everybodys waiting for the Go-Go Boys
Youre turned to stone by the family
Its now the dead speak to the living
Nothing left here but a raging blaze
I dont mean to wait too long
CHORUS
New Yorks in love-
With her big green eyes
And her long blonde hair
New Yorks in flames
New Yorks in love
With the way she talks
And the way she walks
New Yorks in love
Goo Goo Goo Goo Goo GooDay-In Day-Out
Stay-In Fade-Out
Day-In Oo Oo
Day-Out Oo Oo Oo
She was born in a handbag
Love left
On a doorstep
What she lacks is a backup
Nothing seems to make a dent
Gonna find her some money honey
Try to pay her rent
Thats the kind of protection that everyone is shouting about
Day-In day in Day-Out day out
Stay-In Fade-Out
Day-In Oo Oo
Day-Out Oo Oo Oo
First thing she learns is
Shes a citizen
Some things they turn out right
When youre under the USA
Someone rings a bell
And its all over
Shes going out of her way
Stealing for that one good rush
Day-In day in Day-Out day out
Stay-In Fade-Out
She could use a little money
Shes hangin on his arms
Like a cheap suit
Shes got no money honey
Shes on the other side
Oh come on little baby
Late night big town
Police shake down
Oo Oo
Oo Oo
Day-In Day-Out
Stay-In Fade-Out
Oo Oo
Oo Oo
Day-In Day-Out
Shes got a ticket to nowhere
Shes gonna take a train ride
Nobody knows her or knows her name
Shes in the pocket of a home boy
Oo shes gonna take her a shotgun Pow
Spin the grail spin the drug
Shes gonna make them well aware
Shes an angry gal
Day-In day in Day-Out day out
Stay-In Fade-OutIve never sailed on a sea
I would not challenge a giant
I could not take on the church
Time will crawl
Til the twenty-onest century lose
I know a government man
He was as blind as the moon
He saw the sun in the night
He took a top-gun pilot
He made him fly through a hole
Til he grew real old
And he never came down
He just flew til he burst
Time will crawl til our mouths run dry
Time will crawl til our feet grow small
Time will crawl til our tails fall off
Time will crawl til the twenty-onest century lose
I saw a black black stream
Full of white eyed fish
And a drowning man
With no eyes at all
I felt a warm warm breeze
That melted metal and steel
I got a bad migraine
That lasted three long years
And the pills that I took
Made my fingers disappear
Time will crawl time will crawl
Time will crawl
Til the twenty-onest century lose
You were a talented child
You came to live in our town
We never bothered to scream
When your mask came off
We only smelt the gas
As we lay down to sleep
Time will crawl and our heads bowed down
Time will crawl and our eyes fall out
Time will crawl and the streets run red
Time will crawl til the twenty-onest century lose
Time will crawl and our mouths run dry
Time will crawl and our feet grow small
Time will crawl and our tails fall off
Time will crawl til the twenty-onest century lose
Time will crawl and our heads bowed down
Time will crawl and our eyes fall out
Time will crawl and the streets run red
Time will crawl til the twenty-onest century lose
For the crazy child
Well give every life
For the crackpot notionPhotograph king watches you go
Fashions may change heaven knows but you still leave a stain on me
Supplement queen your colours may fade
Seasons may change weather blows but you still leave a mark on me
Wrong-negative fades-never the twain reckless and tame
I like the beat of your drum
I like to look in your eyes
I like to look through your things
Id like to beat on your drum
I like the smell of your flesh
I like the dirt that you dish
I like the clothes that you wear
Id like to beat on your drum
Disco brat-follow the pack
Watching you peel heaven knows prison cant hold all this greedy intention
Vanitys child-picture you now
Music may change-hi-di-ho keen to follow your nose
Wrong-love out of tune
Sweet is the night bright light destroys me
I like the beat of your drum
I like to look in your eyes
I like to look through your things
Id like to beat on your drum
I like the smell of your flesh
I like the dirt that you dish
I like the clothes that you wear
Id like to beat on your drum
Id like to beat on your drum
Id like to beat on your drum
I like your face in the crowd
Id like to beat on your drum
Id like to beat on your drum
Id like to beat on your drum
Id like to blow on your horn
Id like to beat on your drumUp until one century ago there lived
In the Zi Duang provence of eastern country
A glass-like spider
Having devoured its prey it would drape the skeletons over its web
In weeks creating a macabre
Shrine of remains
Its web was also unique in that it had many layers
Like floors in a building
At the top of this palace-like place assembled with almost apparent
Care were tiny shining objects glass beads dew-drops
One could almost call it an altar
When the breeze blew through this construction
It produced sounds of wailing crying
Tiny wails tiny cries
The baby spiders would get scared and search frantically
For their mother
But the Glass Spider would have long gone having known that the babies
Would survive someone on their own
Oh-The Glass Spider had blue eyes almost like-a humans
They shed tears at the wintered turn of the centuries
Dont you hear this wasted cry Life is over you
Mummy come back cause the waters all gone
But youve seen whos in heaven Is there anyone in hell
Mummy come back cause its dark now
Take care take care

But you youve promise in your lovin eye God its dark now
Jah Jah Jah Jah Jah

Mummy come back cause the waters all gone
Stay low on the ground fire can drive you savage and afraid
Spitting the dawn come come come along before the animals awake
Run run weve been moving all night rivers to the left
If your mother dont love you then the riverbed might
Gone gone the waters all gone
Mummy come back cause the waters all gone

Gone gone the waters all gone

And the fabulous sons have crashed their planes in flames
Now tomorrow is back claiming redemption is on your heels
And a toothless past is asking you how it feels
And me my little red corvette has driven by
Fair weather heart has fallen in
My rainyday girl is feeling down
And she tells me that the world is spinning round

Youre nobody else

And its been there all along
It will tumble from the sky

The need to move on
So I pack a bag
And move on
Move on
Well I might take a train
Or sail at dawn
Might take a girl
When I move on
When I move on
Somewhere someones calling me
And when the chips are down
Im just a travelling man
Maybe its just a trick of the mind but
Somewhere theres a morning sky
Bluer than her eyes
Somewhere theres an ocean
Innocent and wild
Africa is sleepy people
Russia has its horsemen
Spent some nights in old Kyoto
Sleeping on the matted ground
Cyprus is my island
When the goings rough
I would love to find you
Somewhere in a place like that
Somewhere someones calling me
And when the chips are down
I stumble like a blind man
Cant forget you
Cant forget you
Feeling like a shadow
Drifting like a leaf
I stumble like a blind man
Cant forget you
Cant forget you
Cant forget you
Cant forget youIm home lost my job and incurably Ill

I think shes dancing
Feel like Dan Dare lies down
I think shes dancing what do I know

that this fantastic voyage
Should turn to erosion
and we never get old
Remember its true dignity is valuable
But our lives are valuable too
Were learning to live with somebodys depression
And I dont want to live with somebodys depression
Well get by I suppose
Its a very modern world
but nobodys perfect
Its a moving world
but thats no reason
To shoot some of those missiles
Think of us as fatherless scum
It wont be forgotten
Cause well never say anything nice again will we
And the wrong words make you listen
In this criminal world
Remember its true loyalty is valuable
But our lives are valuable tooJohnny is a man
And hes bigger than you
But his overheads are high
And he looks straight through when you ask him how the kids are
Hell get home around seven
Cause the chevys real old
And he could have had a cadillac
If the school had taught him right
And he could have married Anne with the blue silk blouse
He could have married Anne with the blue silk blouse
And the food is on the table
But the food is cold
Dont hit her
Cant you even cook
Whats the good of me working when you cant damn cook
Well Johnny is a man
And hes bigger than her
I guess the bruises wont show
If she wears long sleeves
But the space in her eyes shows through
And he could have married Anne with the blue silk blouse
He could have married Anne with the blue silk blouse
Shows through
Shows through
Shows throughHeaven loves ya
The clouds part for ya
Nothing stands in your way
When youre a boy
Clothes always fit ya
Life is a pop of the cherry
When youre a boy
When youre a boy
You can wear a uniform
When youre a boy
Other boys check you out
You get a girl
These are your favorite things
When youre a boy
Boys
Boys
Boys keep swinging
Boys always work it out
Uncage the colors
Unfurl the flag
Luck just kissed you hello
When youre a boy
Theyll never clone ya
Youre always first on the line
When youre a boy
When youre a boy
You can buy a home of your own
When youre a boy
Learn to drive and everything
Youll get your share
When youre a boy

Boys keep swinging
Boys always work it outCHORUS
Yassassin - Im not a moody guy
Yassassin - I walk without a sound
Yassassin -
Just a working man no judge of men
Yassassin -
But such a life Ive never known
We came from the farmlands
To live in this city
We walked proud and lustful
In this resonant world
You want to fight
But I dont want to leave
Or drift away
CHORUS
Look at this - no second glances
Look at this - no value of love
Look at this - just sun and steel
Look at this - then look at us
If theres someone in charge
Then listen to me
Dont say nothings wrong
Cause Ive got a love
And shes afeared
You want to fight
But I dont want to leave
Or drift away
CHORUS
Yassassin Yassassin YassassinYou know who I am he said
The speaker was an angel
He coughed and shook his crumpled wings
Closed his eyes and moved his lips
Its time we should be going
Waiting so long Ive been waiting so waiting so
Look back in anger driven by the night
Till you come
Waiting so long Ive been waiting so waiting so
Look back in anger see it in my eyes
Till you come
No one seemed to hear him
So he leafed through a magazine
And yawning rubbed the sleep away
Very sane he seemed to me
Waiting so long Ive been waiting so waiting so
Look back in anger driven by the night
Till you come
Waiting so long Ive been waiting so waiting so
Look back in anger feel it in my voice
Till you comeAfrican nightmare one-time Mormon
More men fall in Hullabaloo men
I slide to the nearest bar
Undermine chairman I went too far
Bent on a windfall rent a sony
Wonder how the dollar went down
Gotta get a word to Elizabeths father
Hey no he wished me well
Seemed like another day
I could fly into the eye of god on high
His burning eye will see me through
One of these days one of these days
Gotta get a word through one of these days
Asanti habari habari habari
Asanti nabana nabana nabana
Getting in mood for a Mombassa night flight
Pushing my luck gonna fly like a mad thing
Bare strip takeoff skimming over Rhino
Born in slumber less than peace
Struggle with a child whose screaming dreaming
Drowned by the props all steely sunshine
Sick of you sick of me
Lust for the free life
Quashed and maimed
Like a valuable loved one
Left unnamed
Seemed like another day
I could fly into the eye of god on high
Seemed like another day
I could fly into the eye of god on high
Over the bushland over the trees
Wise like Orangutan that was me
His burning eye will see me through
One of these days one of these days
Gotta get a word through one of these days
His burning eye will see me through
One of these days one of these days
Gotta get a word through one of these days
